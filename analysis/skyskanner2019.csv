This app has saved me many hundreds of euros and probably also many hours of searching for flight tickets. It is easy to use and fast.

Good for quickly planning flights over flexible days.
Awesome app. Saves going to different sites to check flight prices.

"this is the absolute best way to find a flight within a price range. it keeps you from having to search day by day, every day."
it is good application and some time you can get price cheaper than the price in airline web
Easy to use. Intuitive. Helpful ( fly to one airport & return from a 2nd one from the same city for a better price or the search option by country rather than by city ) Cheers.
"I mainly use this app to find the cheapest weekend to visit a city on my travel list. It works really well on the iPhone where you can select your destination, filter for weekends, and then browse for the best flight up to almkst a year in advance. On an android you can only browse up to 3 months in advance - at which point prices are higher. If you use it the way I do, you're better off using Google flights or a different app."
It make very easy to search flights in lowest price for any where
This is the place where you can get flight tickets at the best possible price.
Easy to Use..! and getting for a good deal and also u can see the prices of the different airlines in same time..!
easy to use...to much option to search ..good prices ..
It would be great if i was able to say i want a 4 week trip to a certain place at anytime at the best deal. I have yet to find any app or website that does this. All the great prices are for 7 to 10 day vacations.
very nice app every time getting lowest fair comparatively others
great app. i like the part where they notify you when flight prices go down
"The app is OK, but in my opinion it would be great if this app had bundle deals (Flights + Hotel all together)."

Very Simple and Easy Flight Search anywhwere of the world.

very helpful to find flight deals and track price changes
The best application you can use if you wanna look for the cheapest air tickets üòÇ
Absolutely amazing. Able to compare prices and get a guide.
Great for searching for flights and for getting suggestions
"Cheap flights, easy to use and detailed flight description Edit:- please add baggage allowance"
"Especially good if you are open to where you want to go. Can do great queries from a given airport to a target country, and then price degradation over time"
Great app for searching flights. doesn't lag or crash even if you have an older phone.
Great app has never let me down finding the cheap flights I want recommend it to all and the widget always updating every hour keeping me up with all flights. Just one more question why haven't you updated this and reapplied the widget as the widget was very handy to have
"good app. pretty accurate on prices, crashes sometimes, but overall great experience."
"GREAT travel planner. No hidden fees, no annoying ads. No bothersome emails. It's just awesome."
"I use this app all the time for everyone of my trips and even my daughters trips. She is not old enough to fly by herself yet so if i find a great ticket price, I call the airlines to schedule my unaccompanied minors travel and tell them the price of Skyscanner and they will honor it!!üíô this app"
"skyscanner lives by its name, its the bightest star."
"Absolutely the dogs get on it if you want to be mighty, love it, buzzin"
simple clear and gives what it shows love the explore feature
"If you have to rely on ONE flight aggregate app, THIS SHOULD BE IT. I use lots of different apps for finding the best flight deals, and Skyscanner consistently delivers the best prices."
Great app for finding best prices. Does not keep going up in price if you don't buy like some online sites do. Highly recommend if you do much traveling.
i book my flights with the airline direct. is good app to look @ different prices. only am flying blue member so i do more benefits if i book with the airline.
Nice app to keep alerts and notifications for flights
easy to use and a great starting point. just be aware of their fees include checked bags or not
happy that the 'direct flights filter has been added to the date picker.
a very useful app to search for flights timing and cost.
user friendly and verry good prices and comparisons
great website to search for all available options on flights
"I love this app. However, recently, when I choose explore everywhere and select a month, it won't go forward to the search. It reverts to the explore everywhere page on my android device. This feature has worked before though, so I have no doubt this glitch will be quickly fixed. The dev team for this app seems to be top notch."
the best way to find the cheapest flights and train tickets
"I you want a reliable app for cheap and reasonable travel, try this."
just a good website much easier use instead of look around on Google on different websites
"very helpful, but could be finding not just city to city, but country to country as well"
very good for searching diverent flights and starting points
Very convenient to search for prices..offers and can buy directly from here instead of search and buy elsewhere..
Love how it gives several different rates and flights. Keeps me up to date with all my preferences. just wish it had pkgs

Easy to find the right tickets and has many options
skyscanner is best for us and best facilty provide the online tickets

Great app. You get what you want to make a sensible choice
the cheapest tickets I've searched for are in this app!
I can't say anything bad about the app for me is done the job thank you
"Dear Member or members of this app develop team, I am a very fan of your this app. I am using this app for a long time on both iOS (iPhone) and Android and PC... It helped me a lot... but after last update in android, I think I lost your ""Chart"" option for the price of Air Ticket and also another very useful option ""Multi-city""... :-( PLEASE.... PLEASE...... add thoes options again.... we are in need of those options a lot... Thanks a lot for clear me up... :-). (on your reply)"
i used 3 or 4 more apps at the same time... but this app proved to be a genuine and credible one.. it showed the best available rates of my desired flight at that particular time.. one other app(dnt want to disclose the name) showed flat Rs. 1000 off but at the end it was more or less same rate which Skyscanner is already showing.. so go for it guys...
"easy interface, mirrors the online version. Best way to find good value flights and car rentals (havent used the hotel bookings)"
Very wide options worldwide and low cost airlines including
itz best for checking flights... ths is easy for use also...
Very easy to use and to get updates for price changes in flights.
good to find ticket between point to point in the world
"Somethings are still missing, but is the best app or web to find cheap flights. excellent"
"Very handy and quick. In sort and filter, it would be useful to add further options such as sort by cheapest, fastest, most popular, etc. And also to show results based on specific departure / arrival time interval instead of one sided interval."
"Honest, informative and comprehensive. A real help to find the best, cheapest or most adequate flights."
Convenient for all your holiday planning with instant results.
"This application offer many cheap choices from many airlines, like it"
love sky scanner always my first port of call for checking flights
"Edit: Good app, works quite well, jist has a few bugs on older smartphones, thats all."
Extremely amazing discount rates Cheaper than MAKE MY TRIP Please install and see the difference
Easy to use app and I haven't ever found cheaper flights thru other platforms. It's my go to app to search for flights.
"Awesome app, just found smoking deal on tickets. Deal that was no where to be found on websites."
"Always use Skyscanner to checkout prices, especially multi-city travel. Dependent on the pricing by company, will yhen use Quidco if the company offer discount on flights for additional reduction. Definitely recommend other travellers to use this app."
"good options, like the price tracking, never any problems"
I find Skyscanner to be more comprehensive than Google flights.
Very helpul to track cheapest air fares and booking is friendly user.
"Found $29 flight from San Jose to Las Vegas. Now looking forward to finding airfare to Palm Beach to take advantage of a ""free"" Bahamas Cruise. ""Put the lime in the coconut and shake it all up."" lol"
easy to navigate. Gives flight options to and from cities and countries
Awesome app... Can u provide lowest prices of the searching month. Try to include all airlines working in that routes.
very good to have preview on airplane price. but need more price source from more reputable online agent.
"not used it to book anything yet, but find it has nice interface to browse flights and prices"
Good app for comparing prices from different websites...
Nice and conective App for checking trip prices and booking
"This application is good enough, i can compare price with other flight companies and choose the one i need"
it really does find the best value for plane tickets. I've been to 2-3 countries in a year
"While you cant find some airlines on here, it is usually my go to app for finding great deals on flights."
Haven't beat this app with my own research so I trust it. I like the price change alerts on dabbed searches.
Really good for narrowing on all possible flights at a cheeper rate. They also warn you about long layovers and other flight tidbits
excellent application ..shows all flights with prices
You can find the flights that you preferred(price & destinations). Is easy to use!!
option to creating price tracking/alarm is the best feature.
"real good, need important in the design and of course better deals !"
"Among all travel search engines, here I find always the best price."
Best for search cheap flights on open date and destinations
"Easy to use - found a ticket that was substantially cheaper that a ticket being sold (same airline, same flight) by other travel agents."
nice applicationüëâüì± providing lowest fare tickets all over
very easy to use for someone like me that has basic knowledge of technology
Be great if they could have the cheapest month or whole month option like they do on web/mobile browser
sometimes it can see the best connection flights & sometimes price on the website is different from an original price. otherwise it's a good app
would be great if app has the same set of functionalities in browser
"Good one , easy to monitor the price of the flight you interesting"
great application. a suggetion for app is please add cheapest month option in application like Website to find cheapest one.
Great way to work out which flight is best for you. Use the explore option of if you'd like a broader picture of what's available.
just with internet and skype credit. you can call overseas cheap. without international roaming on your own country simcard. even when you are overseas
Skyscanner made my trip easier rather than the other apps.
"not working. it just bounces out. After i ""forced stop"" and cleared the cache, it works properly. thanks for the fast tech support. i changed my rating as well. you guys are great. i wish every app had a tech team like that."
"Genuine Website to book your flights ,easy to access, I'm making booking through this for the last 3 years, if you are not sure with the dates go for other websites, price's are comparitively cheaper...than anyone..."
I love this app but I'm missing the widget! It helps me decide right away if it's a good time to travel
prices looks good but have not tried you yet for bookings and if all goes well with booking then look at 5 stars.....
Excellent fast way to track and gives you extra info of places and what to do around.
very quick n time saving app for a busy person like me
nice and simple you find your best and cheapest flights
"Best deals a woman needs when society has escalated this last few years. So if anyone reads these reviews take this app use it you save heaps and quick, easy no stress involved. A+"
I bought my flight best offer no trouble with the app
ery much helpfull for travelling in other countries
works great. I saved thousands from the us to Germany.
my estimation the best SE Asia flight booking site. not the 5th star csuse there is always room to improve
"friendly user. I am not spring chicken nor a computer nerd. this app is so useful, at least to check that prices are high and cheap tickets are ridiculously longüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
When a flight is needed and you don't know what's available this is perfect. It saved my bacon several times this trip to Europe.
"Whenever i need to book my trips or for my family, Skyscanner always my first apps to go."
"great app , just needs to be a little more in depth ..like the website"
"easy to explore ,but hopelfully you can add another option for payment"
Very good app but needs improvements to be considered excellent. To start with how about adding the Airlines Alliance Grouping function?
Easy to use and best prices but check the airline you choose.
easy to use comprehensive results easy to sort and filter with essential options provided
"I don't even try to plan a trip, without help from Skyscanner: the data provided is accurate, up to date at lowest prices available. Lately, I rented a car at 40% less than all other applications offered. This is the best flight and car rental low prices provider."
Very cheap ticket pricw options with airlines varieties.
I just started to locate flight destination by price and time I found it very easily. Tnx for Sky scanner.
as per my experience i really say it is superb app according to others portal and booking apps
"Fantastic travel app , I use mainly for booking flights . App has all the filters required to tailor your flights , such as take off times , flight Duration and favourite Airlines and remembers the last search ."
It's great. Aggregates prices from almost all sources. I give it 4 stars - the 1 star missing is due to the few sources it does not aggregate from.
Brilliant to use on move particularly when travelling
Ronseal - does what it says on the tin. Updates easy. Helpful tool.
great app for planning if you are not sure where you want to go yet. Plug in a start point and get options of places to go.
"Simple and easy UI, has all the filters for searching different flights and gives a thorough search results."
easy to use when filters are set. great that can add an alert for fare prices.
"Very easy to use and flight tickets are comparatively cheap. But alternative method of booking through internet banking, as we do on Indian cites, must be added. Every body is not necessarily having credit cards in India."
"Fetches true lowest fare and doesn't add bank's convenience fee either while paying through NetBanking. Simple, fast and trustworthy."
I've been with Skyscanner for more than 10 yrs now. International and Domestic flights with this travel site everytime!
"The app is working again now, but there are no widgets available for me anymore? The best and unique feature with this app was the ability to monitor best price for a destination and month on the widget!"
This app makes me an expert in booking flight tickets lol
"Always book through these. Tried a few others, but cheapest by far."
avery good app in getting a nformayion of cheap flights.
it's easy for me to check the cheapest flight round trip
"Gives all the tools you need to find the best flight with best price. Gives you the ability to search for multi city flights, and combine different airliners in one ticket."
it helps to safe time to check on the price. this app will direct you the best offer u can give from which site.
"Usually apps are nice to haves, but this one is just essential!"
Gives useful updates on price changes for flights. Easy to sort and search for ideal options l.
easy to use; scans a large range of travel companies; can create alert.
"it's just the best. Southwest doesn't show results, but I think that's the only major one and no fault of SkyScanner"
for me it's way better than skiplagged in terms of interface.
"Easy app to navigate. Will see the trip planner works, then of coarse see how the trip actually goes."
This is my go to app for finding last minute destination flights
It gave me a deal to travel in flight around 900km in 1150 indian rupees. Its fantabulous.
"Really good app, but needs some improvements for a better User Experience like to be more responsive and better filtered results"
My only go to app for flights around the world. Please continue with the job well done! Best if the platform also includes the land transfer price or advises as not all users will have the land transfer option included in their hotel package.
"very efficient, will always scan for the lowest fare. hopefully it will remain this way and don't change later on... like others do"
Great interface. Finds flight options you'd never find yourself.
very nice app. it prevents to destroy the time in searching cheapest flights.
Have lot of choices to get cheap tickets of different airlines. great effort to keep lot of airlines schedule at one plateform
I got flight ticket at a cery reasonable price with the comparative pricing privided by them from all rhe vendore
easy to find what I want as user friendly and fast search.
Easy to use. You can see a lot of different flight options without having to visit a bunch of websites.
"The app is very good. But it would be better if the function to select ""whole month"" to change to custom range."
"I love the 2015 version, we can make a widget for the dates of our travel plans. Why the widget option is no longer available??"
"if possible booking flight and hotel in one package, could be better"
I still like and use it. But I prefer the older version that show you more deals
"it does what is must do. good price comparison. no ads, just good rates."
Waaaaaaaay quicker than manually searching for cheap flights.
"missing few features from the www version, but still cool"
very good for finding cheap flights but not as many features as their website
"So as a person who loves to travel and always travels on a budget, there's better apps and websites out there. I mostly use Expedia because they offer packages. I always travel alone (which is always pricier) but I wanted to compare prices for a trip to Dublin,Ireland for Dec 2019. Same days, same airlines,same hotel and car rental. Skyscanner was 500 dollars more than what Expedia offered. Just do your research and happy travels! üòÅ"
Easy to find the cheapest price for flights around the world
Takes all the work out of searching for flights...and so easy to use...
"Works fine, but if it would be possible to delete searches from the recent search list it would be even better."
definitely cheaper flights on same route as other apps
have not purchased tickets but i like the search abilities
I needed something that provides dependable alerts when flights become cheaper. this did just that.
It's doing the job! Found where I'm going with ease and set notifications. My only gripe is i had to set notifications for each different day as my departure date is flexible and I'm just looking for the cheapest flight.
easy to use I would improve something's like looks for flexible dates
This app actually works & bypasses all those corporate owned sites that send you to the most expensive sites n rates. You have to work at it but can find good rates.
Was excellent now easier to check on PC. Have to select dates first. Huge leap backwards in end user ease of use. Google flights now prefered choice
so far so good. it doesn't help if you're looking for international flights
Useful application for those who are travelling frequently.
Easy to get a cheap price for flight ticket and hotel
One-stop app for all booking needs to get the most affordable price
"Good... Good, but need more functions like matrix price review by dates"
So much easier than the websites of some airlines. Also saves time manually comparing them all
No option for cheapest month and lacking interface/ navigation . The website is awesome tho
A best application to save your hard earned money while booking flights
used many times. cannot say a bad word about it. excellent.
"since I know Skyscanner, it's the only tool I use to look for flight's best price"
Its better than all the apps i have tried and tested
Quick results while searching the flight information and displaying the same with reasonable airfare.üòé
"very user friendly. good filtering of airlines, airports, etc.. like the alerts for flights previously researched whether the price is +/-"
very good but when we book its takes additional charges such as conv. fee
"haven't purchased a flight yet, but seem to find good deals. just trying to decide where to go."
Download literally any other app n you will be better off
"very very useful, a little hard to navigate the app, but that could be because I'm a bit of a technophobe"
"i always find the cheapest rates on here. tried everything else like kayak, hopper, momo, cheapflights"
I have not used it. But enjoyed while surfing informations on fare & locations.
so easy to use. would be nicer to add the option to search for price on multiple dates at one time. example: (june flights between the 20th to the 30th); multiple departure flights one way or rounndtrip.
A good overview of the flight schedules with their fares.
Easy to use and you can get notifs for the specific date bookings if prices changed.
Easy to search for flights and hotels from multiple sources under 1 App.
"App was working great, but today it will not let me input departure and return dates. When I input departure date the return date defaults to departure date... This is was resolved by reinstalling the app. So far all is good...!!!! So from I'll rate it a 5 instead of 2 stars..!!!"
Does the hard work of searching multiple airlines for great flight prices!
Very useful. Sometimes there are some cheap flights missing.
i will alway check with skyscanner before booking cos they always have cheaper rates
"Edit: Just find out I can choose a country (in my case Italy) and the app provides me all possible solutions for the airports in that country. PREVIOUS REV: Great app, but add the possibility to search from (and to) more than one airport in different cities. For example, I can choose between two or more airports in different cities nearby. At the moment I have to search manually. You already do with multiple airports in a city like new York. So, please do it also with airports in different city."
Very easy and accurate better than agents who hardly i found of any help.
"long time goto app. not too convinced with new style, but functionality just beats the rest. spot on"
"So so so non intuitive UI, older versions were much better, easier to understand and faster too. Not liking it, user experience sacrificed for looks. Edit: Thank you for coming back to me, good to know you don't take these things personally, keep making us happy :)"
The app worked fabulously and i used it to travel to vatious locations across globe. Recently i am froced to use other apps as skyscanner is not giving complete result and misses many airlines. Whereas if skycanner is opened on web it gives complete results. Please look into it. I will rate the app again if the glitches are removed.
"works ok from a phone, but would prefer booking on a desktop"
"The app itself is good, clean, easy to use and offers the same as the web browser version...the reason that I've marked it down is my phone kept detecting it using the camera in the background, despite me switching off the permission to do so."
"Very easy apparently to use to find the best priced flights. The filters and sort options make it very easy to use. the only improvement would be if the filters could recognise flights that cross over midnight. These results are included in the ""arrive before"" time because the end up in the early AM but that isn't what I'm after."
"Its most specific app for find cheap flights, hotel"
Downloaded the app for the first time. Selected my filters and also notification for price drops. So far app has done its job by notifying me on a price drop. Will continue posting with results after ticket purchase.
Friends keep on introducing me to new apps but l still prefer Skyscanner especially when i switch to take me EVERYWHERE. Its a smart way to travel. Skyscanner is user friendly and less time consuming. Thanks guys i hope you dont do some kind of an upgrade that could wreck my nerves.
"Quick and Easy to pick the most up, also a variation of filter"
"Won't be using until they add whole calendar view, which is the most useful setting on the browser site."
Useful for keeping track of flights and prices. Good for setting up alerts on flights as well. Would be nice if you could manually delete individual recent searches.
"Consistently the best out there. Yes, I still compare prices, via a couple of other top ranking apps. Prices may be +/- afew ¬£. But, I tend to come back to Skyscanner, due to their sponsorship of reliable ticketing agents. And, from experience, importantly, Skyscanner's very professional customer service. 1 unfortunate negative - too much space given up to roll up ads."
have gotten 2 airfares and both for super cheap. have not traveled with them. I will update when I do.
great i alwaya use it versitile as you can check lowest orice month.
"undoubtedly fetches the best prices out there, and confiable. only disadvantage compared with Kayak is the flexibility of its filters"
"Easiest way to choose flights, hotels and car rentals."
Gud application but if it got payment option it will be better
"Easy and convenient, but not always the cheapest. I use it regardless."
Very fast at information that you require on your travels.
"i am pretty pleased so far.I am trying to fly home for the birth of my first grandchild, the layovers scare me a little bit I have to get home don't want to get stuck in some random airport."
great app wish there was an alert when deals happen
"Great app. Tells you everything you need to know, like when you get there at certain time that there is no public transport available."
I love the skyscanner website but the app doesn't let me search a whole month to find the cheapest dates.
very low price flights ticket than any other website
"By far the best app for planning your flight. But! It would be perfect if it gives you info about luggage fees, since most of airlines charge extra fees for checked in luggage nowadays."
I booked a trip around the entire Europe for less than $200.
i would like to be able to put an alert on a multi destiny trip
helpful apps to plan and find the best ticket price
excellent service! spent ages trawling different sites shouldn't have wasted my time. Mal
app where you found d what you need in short time and reliable source.
Always turn to this app to check flights for cheapest or cheaper options
Very Competitive prices for almost all the destinations
"Now it's much better than a year ago,still I would like to see the explore on the map. My 2017 review ""The old version was the best travel search application. Unfortunately i am not using Skyscanner anymore, there are other much better options."""
Very good app overall to get a sense of prices and find a good deal. Filters help a lot to screen out nonsensical flights. But it would be very beneficial if one could select checked baggage and factor that into the price. Often times the prices don't match and I rarely travel with hand luggage only. Also a possibility to have a timeline graph of the changing prices would be informative.
finds the cheapest flights searches all the airlines
help full good free cancellation at 199INR per person where MMT &GOIBIBO r charging around 16 to 1700
very clear information & varieties in flight timing
One star for the worth idea to put new screen with hotels while you look for tickets.
"I like the app itself, one of the best on the market. BUT, the new logo is.. Well, I won't say ugly, but it does not ""say"" anything to me. The old one was far better. Nowadays, almost every logo is either red or dark blue. It's too simple. Every time I saw something turqoise, I associated it with skyscanner.. Now, all I see is a bikini with a half loading circle above it. Sun? Nope."
good application make you know all the lowest fare if flight
Easy to use and I live how it notifies you of price changes
Plethora of Options....nowhere else found....Nice Application...
Almost perfect. An improvement would be the possibility to choose a week or a specific number of days in the search of flights and in the alarm of price variations.
"When I see the best offers of each month it appears to me as a very good price but when I click to book, it's a completely different price.."
"This app doesn't notify you just to advertise something. I really like that. I like that it shows prices With the taxes, etc. That has always bothered me about other apps."
dope app. saved me $115 you really need to know how to pack with just a carry on.
"It's fast and reliable. I got my ticket 10 minutes after I book my flight. but they should have put here the ""Add bagage"""
"pretty straightforward. shame we can't book open ended tickets via the site, but still useful."
Much better than the web page on mobile. And sure who doesnt like cheap flights?
"I like the ability to look for flights by month and save them. I would like a feature where we can look by cheapest month like on the desktop site. I also wish the green dots meaning the available flights actually showed the price before clicking on the day, because it ranges from $500-900 ish."
"Very good app for finding and booking flights and hoels worldwide. It used to show a chart of prices for a month, which I could not find."
"Decent app but doesn't have the full searching capabilities of the mobile website. Please also add (to the app and/or the full website) the functionality of selecting ""everywhere"" as the departure location not just the destination location - would be so useful as you could then combine cheap flights to create an even cheaper fare."
Nice app to search . Many other websites hide cheap flights
"The new update is very complicated, it was much easier before üò©"
The app is all about deceivingly cheap offers that don't exist. Only $139 to Cambodia! But when you dive in the cheapest return flight is $1000 more! It never happened that the real price equalled to the highlighted offer on the front page. It's all about tempting and bluffing with Circe-like songs. Once Skyscanner was THE place for finding cheapest flights but this is no more so. Today the best offers are once again on airline own sites.
"great app but needs to be more transparent with its pricing as I noticed different price correlations between regions like for example it was more expensive to buy the exact same flight going the same way for the region of Thailand, then if I bought a flight in Europe which I found strange. but overall a good app to use if you want cheap flights."
maximum options with free long hours stops and competitive rates
"I love this app you get given lots of options, must be careful when booking though, I live in Australia and assumed all the prices were AUD, got caught.üò±"
So far I always find Skyscanner prices lower for flights and hotels.
"the price are not up-to-date, when you click in the price is different or the flight is not available, can go up to RM200 differences, but still good apps to check for cheaper flight, hopefuply they will do more better on this part."
It is nice app. Searches wide variety of ticket provider and recommends better rates. Can you make one improvement- During flight search I always need to select the date. Can you provide next and previous date navigations. Say Im searching flight for 6 November and I don't find one suiting my choice then I can select next and previous and it shows data of 7 nov or 5 nov date and so on. Currently i have open the calendar select 7 Nov
it saves time and data. upu dont have to shift from app to another app to search for the cheapest flight
muy recomendable porque permite pagar directamente con la aerol√≠nea
Cheaper compared to other apps..no hidden charges..but only thing is they dont provide rates of +- 2 or 3 days in the date chart so we can plan accordingly
Good. Having trouble with multi location. Other than it's good.
"great app easy to use .. only downside is the price quoted isnt nessecarily the price you pay, when directed to the actual page can be a bit more,having said that i use skyscanner all the time for alerts to price change etc..."
app is good. but there should be an option to select the enitire month range instead of particular dates. the entire month range option is present in the website but not in this app.
"best deal for flight,I have been using make my trip for the last 3 years but as my booking increased making my trip, the prize would have been expensive for me. But this app shows actual rate"
"The application offers lot of choices to choose from but, sometimes, the sites don't have the advertised price. Therefore, only 4*... However, you can have a good idea about the prices and the best month to fly. I use Skyscanner every time I need some tickets, for me or my friends."
great app.. this will be the last app to uninstall from my mobile.
Easy to use...user friendly ...but could not see option of zero cancellation
I gave it Three stars for now. I haven't really reserve or bought any ticket yet. I will update my rating later on.
"in cheap flights here, and then book with the airline"
honest app. cheap o air app will give you high prizes once they know that you shopping.... for flys
initial impressions are that the app looks great and has nice features. yet to cross check prices with other sources which is where this app fell short a few years ago
good other app comparison is the best cheapest rate but one thing only duration time is more hrs waiting is wast of time Please check the one otherwise is good
Dangerous because it makes everything affordable. So many choices!
"Loved this app before the new update. It would tell me the cheapest, 2nd cheapest, shortest, 2nd shortest and rate the flights between 1-10. Now it just shows the price and nothing else. Uninstalling."
a nice one for comparison.. but the final price is always different at the time of payment
Could you add a feature of reverse search. You have explore from one destination to everywhere but I would like to see explore from everywhere to a particular destination.
muy √∫til! he ahorrado mucho dinero us√°ndola para mis viajes.
"Really great app, it shows Actuall price however rest app shows higher amount first and after giving promo code they come to the actual price, I would always prefer this app instead of others as they are making us fool and wasting your time."
Muy √∫til para mi trabajo igual que mis vacaciones. Vuelos baratos y m√°s.
"Downloaded the app because of all the ads saying it would save so much money. Checked prices against other sites, and saved over $100 each by booking through another site. Do your comparisons."
"This service always finds me the cheapest flights, but I would like better search options because I often don't care when I fly, only when it's the cheapest. I find other services are better at this."
"I'm using it since it came up,I was very happy with it, unfortunately i told the world about it ,so everybody is using it now,so cheap flights arent as available as before! üò•"
"Great app, lil confusing at times tho... Think it needs a ui refresh"
It's a good app. Occasionally marred by slow updates of the flight availability. Have not tried other functions other than the flight purchases.
good but I saw price in BDT but when I m proceed to purchase its show another currency
"Very usefull easy to use ,only problem is I cant search multiple airport like I do on web site."
"Giving 3 star bcoz of limited acess. Best app for searching flight just need some more information and acess like, meal selecting, seat selection, mail id filling option to send ticket on mail instead of automatically taking mail ID of someone else. Plz do improvements like xiago have many options."
seems to be a good app but i haven't actually booked a flight yet...
"Fantastic app. The UI is clean and the filters are unusually powerful for a mobile app. My only complaint is that I wish the desktop site showed the plane type and features the same way the app does. I like to fly larger planes if possible, so knowing if my flight legs are going to be on a 737 or a 777 matters to me, and that isn't something I can see on the desktop website."
"My buena aplicaci√≥n, muy buenos precios y permite comparar bien entre los d√≠as"
"I only used this app for the widgets, but they have been removed since the update. Would be great if widgets were returned as it was definitely the stand out feature for this app."
never disappointed when looking for flight even in the last minute time. Always provide the cheaper price compare other website
seen the best application but kindly fill it properly issue comes from first last name
flight rares are comparatively cheaper than make my trip
Great app but I wish I could set the granularity of notifications. $1 and $2 price changes don't matter but $20 changes do.
nice App. but Convenience charge need to be reduced.
replaces the need to get ripped off by flight centre. love it
"the good price keeps disappearing after I select it, but it makes searching for a getaway easier"
"As a regular traveller to far flung places, I always start the journey in Skyscanner"
It's great application but you need to improve 2 points 1- when I decide to travel out of my country to another destination you should provide filter for direct flights to selected city 2- If I select economy class you should mention clearly the weight for bags since sometimes after booking I had been surprised by baggage allowance
"nice app, but i have like 4 possible departure airport near to me, but i cannnot select 4 possible departure /arrival airports for 1 trip. would be more helpful."
Kayak app is way better. Really love Skyscanner but not this app! Difficult to use and it's not easy to find the best deals
so for I really like the app for searching. I can't say if it's good all the way to reservations because I haven't made a reservation yet.
"lowest fare in this app, must have this app in phone"
Muy √∫til y buena opci√≥n para buscar vuelos a buen precio. El Editor tiene razon
"I've used Skyscanner for a long while now and have found numerous excellent international & domestic fares on the site. However, recently the app continually crashes as soon as it is opened. Uninstalling and reinstalling it temporarily fixes it, but after a short while it simply refuses to open. Maybe it's an android or Samsung issue, but it's a pain having to repeatedly uninstall and reinstall. That said, it's still the best app for flight searches worldwide."
"Good app which I have used for a number of years. Don't like the new search interface. The older versions were much quicker to use. I want to select to, from and dates all on the same page without having to click to the next window."
l like multi destination option which is not available in other apps
Great site but usually flights gone when you try too book them
vry gud app always give cheap tickets price comparison to other
Great app but the fares it shows are higher then the market
"Useful only for airliners, old version is much better ! :("
Love the App but these days I can't find cheap tickets compared to a year before
"for every travel in the world,but it be little better if they had service for transport for every destinations you should travel in the world"
Ticket prices are very close to expedia ($1 cheaper in my flight from US to UK) but the same upgrade on expedia priced at $140 costs $400+ on this app.
"Probably the best app of it's kind, but price alerts don't observe my filters, plus no support for flexible dates."
"good price alert, but please add one more option in which we can select only drop price not the higher than actual selected time."
I have been using this app and recommening SkyScamner for years
"Good app overall. However, sometimes it is difficult to see if luggage is permitted."
it's a gd app to gv u overview but ur bounded by their selections. it wud b better if we can customize each timing that we need n then b routed to the sites for the booking
"I have been using another fare finder and have found it to be better at finding much cheaper prices some fares that Sky scanner dont list, I use both though just to make sure I get the best air fares. it's been over 18 months since my last review. have noticed that a lot of prices being shown on Skyscanner are from companies that have less than favorable reviews , might be a good idea to remove these companies and have minumum ratings instead of listing them so to help keep the rogues out."
It's very useful for my searches. I do wish I could select diff date/time combinations. It's annoying that I have to scroll to get to a combination that works for me.
we can compare all fares at one place. Save money and time.
Odlicna aplikacija za pronalazenje jeftinih letova. Bravo
"so far so good for one way and round trips but when you put in Multi City the results are so confusing I can't make it out. I am looking for a long haul Int'l flight with multi cities and I am totally lost. Other than this, its a good app."
love the price alerts.tho sometimes there r problems in booking the tkts on the partner websites
Provides a wide variety of flight options we would not have thought of.
easy & accessible app...would be better if lowest rates on the calendar is displayed /shown...lowest rate of the day.
"App is easy, good, accurate and gives you the legroom dimensions on flights. But beware some of the ticket vendors as they can be vermin."
No need to fix what is not broken. From easy intuitive app went to cheap unclear interface
Don't Collect/Share My Data. I really like this app but since there is no opt out option with collecting/sharing my data it's time for me to go.
"This is genuinely a great app that helped me a ton with price comparing and buying tickets for an upcoming trip. however, did something happen in the last update? for some reason in Upcoming Trips, there's no longer an option to enter flight info (did I dream that's how I added my last flights?) and no matter what I search on what date, it tells me there's no flights for the route. v frustrating, I really liked that feature"
"Horrific in the US... I first learned about this app through my travels in Asia and have to say it has saved me time and money on that continent. However, in the US when I search for flights I only get the ""major"" carriers and very few if not, none of the budget carriers show up in the search. I just saved $120 on RT flights by NOT using this app"
"Curret app finding not best deals. Like example I founded 1 deal in shyscanner and exactly same in Ryanair. Difference around ¬£60 Ryanair won. And string after I founded another deal better then in skyscanner. May be it work sometimes but, I prefer searching mu self and I will sure I really fimd best deals."
"Often use this app, and my stars sum up how my experience going"
easy to use but some times more fees applied than announced at the end of booking
we are big travellers and use only this website to book flights now
"top air ticket app, using it for 7 years for getting flights from the other side of the world"
I get my flights from here for all long haul travel
i always get my flights through skyscanner. some of the prices have been unbelievable.
"Well it was great, but after Update now it doesn't work or closes itself randomly. What did you do??? Uninstalled and reinstalled twice, now works just fine."
"Very useful app but I can't find the ""add nearby airports"" option that is available on the Web version."
Es una aplicacion compleja y de mejor calidad para encontrar los mejores viajes al mejor precio
Prior to this last upgrade Skyscanner was excellent now it sucks used it for the last few years not much longer perhaps my comments are a bit strong but find it harder to navigate personally enjoyed the feature were I could plan and book flights months ahead that feature seems to now have gone amongst other simple to use navigation features
the best filter is Missing in the current version. Wil it come back?
"I have asked Skyscanner staff to pursue refund of the Jet Airways ticket. They do help and the travel agent Travelgenio, albeit their usual unresponsiveness, eventually reply."
"Very good app. There is a bug when I change currency, the currency symbol change but the price didn't."
"first port of call for flights, holidays and inspiration"
"Website Amazing, mobile app orribile. The app tries to guide you, but it is stressing that you can't do the enlarged researches you can do from the website."
"Mmm, I AM looking for a different flights and in this app I found several option for this"
used it once to go to Ireland. Im about to use it again to go to Norway
Will give 5 stars if the Month Overview Fares is reinstated. This is the most useful feature but sadly it's taken away!!ü§î
BEST EVER FOR FLIGHT RATES I HOPE THEY KEEP PRICES LOW.
Cheapest flights to be found on here but be careful of Travelgenio...prices on their site can change quickly even while you are booking
"Great app but why can't you filter departure time both ways, leave before a certain time as well as leave after a certain time like on the browser version..."
"Good apps to use if you've already known your time of departure. But if you want to search for the cheapest rate regardless of time, it's difficult to be used"
Starts anytime while using your phone in fullscreen. It will change your browser settings. Persistent app even It was set to forced stop... It was only on startup after install.
"muy buena app, me encanta siempre la uso cuando viajo"
User friendly. everything you need. improvements: make sure luggage fees are included in quotes clearly. make sure it is easy to contact 3rd party airline booking agencies in case of future issues. over booking should be banned
"We travel a lot and skyscanner always has the best deals. Except one website the used called fareboom it always lies about the deals, once you click on the price it says it's not available"
"Changing your options to search for different flights is difficult. You cant just click on the section you want to change , you have to back compmetely out of the search amd start a new one basically. But there are alot of cheap flights available."
I definitely check this app against other prices for flights I book.
this time it worked I bought the ticket half price compare of the airways own page. good deal. thanks.but the alarm is not functioning. prices are doubled not even one single warning
Was fine until I updated it. How come I had multicity option before the update and now I don't have it? This is what I use the most!
Had a trip planned for 300$ checked a few mins later to book it and the price almost doubled. Sure that wasnt some scare tactic at all. Thanks
good but rates change by the time you reach the website
It's very poor app regarding mmt Mmt is very good app like air trivialing Lo cost flights available in mmt
"provide cheaper prices than other apps and even price from the airline, so the prices it provided must be the cheapest. the cheapest price is from an agent but it didnt provide enough time for me to entry data. So, eventually, I bought tickets from the airline."
"Primeira vez que uso, primeira reserva de passagens feita, foi r√°pido e eficiente, por enquanto nado do que reclamar."
"Es muy buena aplicaci√≥n para comprar boletos, me da variedad de precios y de aerol√≠neas."
"App works pretty well. One day an alert popped up on my phone that said Skyscanner has just attempted to use the camera, or something to that effect. As a flight search app has zero need of the cameras, it felt like a direct violation of my privacy so I immediately removed it."
"best website for airlines, hands down. worst app to find a flight, ever. skyscanners greatest thing they offer is ""cheapest month"" while searching and the app doesn't have that. it also takes soooo much longer to find the flights than it takes to find the same flights on their website. skip the app, use the website."
Where is the flexibility to search? every single app can search from exact airport on exact date. what makes an app great is when they allow you to search with flexibility of dates and airports. this is missing here making this basically useless.
"I love Sky Scanner, it usually serves me well but lately, it is useless. Why tell me there is a direct flight from ¬£28 then when I click through there are no direct flights and the cheapest if over ¬£200? How is that helpful? Practically renders the app useless, I am going to have to find my flights somewhere else now till you fix this issue. Then I may come back. Also like someone else mentioned, bring back the 'cheapest', 'quickest', '2nd cheapest', etc, you used to have. Much better with that."
Use this application to check for fares and best feasible flight options.
Lowest Fares for the past 2 years. Every time we fly we use SkyScanner.
"Good app since you can view different price range from every other airline. But when you view to the original site, the price range is high.üòëüòëüòë"
Was an excellent 5 star app which I have used all the time over the last five years. Sadly it has becomes much less user friendly and slow 2 start app after the latest update.
"I love skyscanner on the web, but unfortunately the app doesn't share one of the most useful features of thr website - the ability to add nearby airports to your search. I find i skip the app and go straight to the website as I can usuaally find a better deal there."
A very good app but sometimes under explore feature fares shown do not match with final rates.
"Some apps directly showing prices in calender dates but in this app not showing prices so this is my suggestion add this features and second thing is add on more features like tour packages like other apps ex..goibibo, Cleartrip, etc..."
Es buena apllcacion para buscar vuelos y conexiones econ√≥micas
Good place to book your flight...few times difficult when language causes problems and a bit difference of rates in final stages of booking...
"Great app. have been using it for years. But for the last year I haven't been able to get the widget to work on my phone or my tablet. Have tried everything, even reformatting both my phone and my tablet."
"Brilliant. I only wish the app allowed the ""include nearby airports"" as the website does. Also, any app including ads should have an option for users to pay & remove ads..."
When i have a plan to travel mostly i used this application but there is an issue for fixing when i try to choose the hotel there is no respond hopefully you can fix it thank you skyscanner
Cuidado!!! Empresa n√£o possui SAC. Nunca repondeu √† nenhuma reclama√ß√£o nao Reclame Aqui!!!!!
"I love this app and have been using it for the last 5 years. However, some sites are really hard to use or just completely useless like Modetour, Hanatour and Interpark. Why are they even an option if there is no English available on those sites? You also can't pay on those sites unless you are a member of some sorts somewhere, so again those sites are completely useless to give as options, it makes me happy to see good prices and times just to go onto their websites and be frustrated! Not happy"
Lots of fare options lots of choice airlines. About time Skyscanner opts for 1 stop ticket purchase instead of links to travel agents were prices can change.
"You can't sear h all the flights. It just tells you the cheapest deals. Way better on browser because you can actually be specific or vague about your flight dates, whereas the app seems to just choose a date for you? It doesn't just show the cost of the flights on the calendar. So difficult to use"
This app is good for checking out flight but when you go to the websites it's a pain if you make a mistake and want to go back as it takes you allllllll the way to the first page and you have to imput your details once again. This is not the apps fault but the websites themselves.
Usually can find the best deal for flights. Only thing I am missing is to be able to run a search for more than one departure and arrival airport.
"Updated: I bought international plane tickets through EXPLORETRIP at $1,053. After I received the e-ticket, within minutes a rep said my 3 hour layover is now 18 hours contrary to their confirmation. I said I want to cancel but she said I can have the SAME FLIGHT I BOOKED for $54 more. This experience was very distasteful. However, Skyscanner rep followed through and within a day EXPLORETRIP said they'll refund $54 within 7-10 business days. Skyscanner is very effective in protecting its users!!"
Filters could be optimized so I can apply more before searching for flights
good to keep track of price but not all airlines inclusive
for flight i got chepest price than the official website and travel agents
"(NOV03) - changed to 2 STAR, every now and then fails to load my upcoming trips. Need to re-install the app - its my favourite app, kindly fix this!"
"If you're looking for vacation and you don't know the destination and having tied budget, you can count on this application."
"i loved this app, it was my 'go to app' when I needed to locate flights and used it frequently to source ones suitable for me. However in the last few weeks it's stopped working on my phone Blackberry android phone . Despite several re-installations it won't even open. I can only assume it's a software update. Am now left very very frustrated and struggling to source flights......Update. after using the link to update the Skyscanner Team about problem. They listened and resolved them !"
East to use and sets alerts for the flights I want to watch.
Gosto do app. As informa√ß√µes s√£o claras e completas.
"Used to love this app and used it frequently. However after the last update I can't open flights, hotels and cars"

now rate big coming.kindly inform low rate may june
"Incredibly high prices, it's algorithm take you only to the highest prices."
"Great app. Seems to be an issue at the moment with additional passengers (children in particular) where even though they have been selected, they need to be added again on the airline website. Usual have to start all over again."
Superb app. There must be an option in filters to select the departure time. Eg:- I want to see a flight that departs between 10 AM and 3 PM. Currently i can select after 10 AM but can't select before 3 PM.
I entered my flight info and waited 2 weeks. The flight cost fluctuated by a dollar or two and then it just started going up. I was able to get a cheaper flight on my own. I am now uninstalling.
"If for instance you travel from A to C with connection in B, the app would rather present more expensive options from the same company than connect two differing companies which would be much cheaper."
Muito bom e facil de usar tem otimas promocoes o melhor que ja vi
Widget does not appear in widget list any more! (Huawei mate 20 pro + nova launcher)
Had it shown the related informations like transit visa requirements etc. then it could have achieved 5 star rating!! There is no merit in showing sleep plan and public transport availability as these are quite obvious from the timings
I would like an option to select a bracket of dates rather than just one.
Needs a way to delete search history or separately show price alerts so I can make a neat dashboard of of price alerts. Otherwise this rocks.
where is the widget for samsung must launch it again
"This app used to be excellent but has taken backward leaps with each update it seems. The graphing function was fantastic & would show you the cheapest & most expensive Flights if you had this luxury of choice, but now it just shows magnifying glass/search icon, which is quite annoying & time consuming! Please bring back this function instead of it saying 'no data available'"
"Like the app but find it difficult that I have to search THEN filter. Would be so much better and less time consuming to filter first. So if I want to find flights to anywhere but only direct ones lasting under 4 hours, I'd like to be able to search using those advanced terms. At the moment I search but flights that last over 30 hours with 3 stops come up. Most of the flights advertised as in budget take 2 days to get to destination. Please could you introduce more search parameters?"
As a person that travels alot this is a much need apps. Others apps such as hopper and Google flights don't show as many available tickets as this one
melhor App de busca de passagens e hot√©is. Encontrei passagens com descontos enormes
"I always use the app, I like it. But I can't search for a hotel atm. When I click on the button nothing happens. I'm on a pixel phone"
"Always used Skyscanner for years and 90% of my travel. However taking a couple of stars off. The more added vendors, the more I'm facing a situation where prices quoted are later not available once you go to the 2nd stage of booking. Annoying and never used to happen before in this volume. Hopefully more control over practices that are evidently click baits from some companies. Otherwise a stable app and generally good rates in normal use."
I regularly use skyscanner to check and book flights.
"its OK, but not as functional as an app as the web site is. Can't do an 'open' search or search by month etc. The app would be better if it had the full functionality. UPDATE. after speedy info from customer support have tried as suggested and it works. It was just my inability to use the app properly. Have upgraded from 3 to 5 stars."
The prices it first quoted are often much higher when you go to view the flights. Can be 2 or 3 times the original quoted price. The app used to work very well but recent changes reduce it's usefulness.
"I love the web version. The app isn't great though. Really slow, doesn't allow you to see exact prices on the map, etc."
I downloaded this app specifically because they claimed to support price alerts for multi-city flights. However I can only find an option to monitor prices for a specific flight.
It has crashed aftet I was using it for 2 months. I am reinstalling it again and giving it another chance since I liked it in the past.
coool thou i would always still check directly on the airline website
Pl add baggage allowance cat. in all flights so that one can be aware about luggage weight and size
Wonderful.. Though few deceitful third party vendors must be refrained from disguising passengers
trabajen con otras aerolineas seria mas facil y economico para los pasajeros..
What have you done !! I used to be able to search flights everywhere and get a list according to price. This was exactly what I needed and now it's gone. Please return this feature or I'm sorry but I'll be gone . Thanks
The book for fligth is to expensive... i though its more cheaper than traveloka but its 2x the price.... wow!
It is like a place where everbody will get travel solution.
"Very disappointed with the removal of ""multycity"" option. It was very useful. I hope it will be back"
"Doesn't sync watchlist between devices. Sponser ad, in Skyscanner app, pointed me to a better app."
Very responsive app. Only downside is that it doesn't provide options for packages
When u search and then your simply refresh the page. Up goes the price by 10euro.make sure youve got your vpn running
"Used to be a fan of this app. Before they became more interested in telling me what my effing carbon footprint was The only footprint, I'm interested in. Is the one I would like to stick up there back side for letting a bunch of EnviroNazis screw up a perfectly good app."
had this app for years and never had a problem with it.... since last update I cannot search for flights anymore.... general search still works but once I click on the specific date it shows no connection.... well I have a connection since I am writing this review right now.... fix it or revert to previous version
"Still like the app, but it would be nice to set the departing airport when selecting the ""any time"" option. As it is right now, it keeps defaulting to the tiny local airport that doesn't have commercial flights, instead of the regional airport 30 miles down the road."
"(1) Includes all economical flights, (2) V4.15 contains all features needed [ one way, two way, monthly chart ] .... Will be ultimate if u say the price below each date (may be too much to ask for, but that would me final expectation from this app :-) ) Updated feedback on 4-Sep-2019: One bug: V5.75.1: Filter by ""AirAsia"" airlines shows empty list, may be a problem with ""AirAsia"" / ""Thai AirAsia""."
I don't know what happened to this app. You used to be able to select your airports and then it would show you the cheapest days. Now it forces you to pick dates. Which means I spend an hour going through week by week trying to find the cheapest flights. Google does a better job now than this does. This used to be my go-to app. Garbage now.
"I used to use it as my first app, but it doesn't have all results for some flights. I don't get direct flights, while I know there are such because I can see it in the Ryanair's app for the same date range. Looks nice, works nice but I don't trust it anymore."
The app is crashing on my Blackberry Android and it has recently started. It was fine until last few weeks. Please sort this out. The same app is working fine on my iphone.
overall good but my android reported this apps access the camera. May I know why this apps need access to the phone camera ?
Would give 5 stars if the pricing shown in the calendar picker always matched the price in the search results. Sometimes it's a bit off unfortunately.
"Why make an app that is worse than the website? I don't see prices in the calender overview, there is no option for cheapest month and whole month, I cannot find my price alerts and the worst: when I change to another app and back, the app reloads, my search is gone and not even in the history.. very annoying. I like the interface and it's nice that you can share the flight easily, for that I give a second star."
"This app would actually have made me pay more because I was on Delta site and found a good flight before taking a look at this app. I looked and noticed that first they didn't have lower prices then the ones I found. Also, they lied because on one of the cheaper supposed days to fly as they said it was more expensive then the day I flew which according to them had moderate prices."
"UK doesn't charge taxes (or something) for ages 15 and under but the app is not asking for ages. ***Update*** nothing still done for UK users, it's been 8 months."
"What happened to the flight ratings??? I travel international very often and I used to love using this app, it was rating each flight based on price, length, layover, etc. which was amazing. Now I don't know whether that went! This is extremely dissatisfying and disappointing. Fix this ASAP or I'm deleting this app."
For me the whole point of using flight aggregators is to search complex multi-city flight possibilites. There used to be clear cut the From airport and To airport. Now the From airport is hidden with a small font on top. In dialect we have a saying... Just be Smart dont Act Smart. Not evrybody is planning a trip from GPS phone location.
"I have not use the app yet to bye my ticket however, I wish to find low price of ticket soon. I am receiving daily email on the price."
"The new version of the app keeps wanting me to ""explore""; for example if I search flights for London (Any) to South Africa (Any) I get Capetown and Durban as trip options (No Johannesburg); you then get loads of information, reviews, hotels etc. All unnecessary when trying to book a flight home. I'm sure the old version of the app just gave a list of flights with a mix of airports - no fuss. Can't you keep it simple and have a separate section of the app for your ""explore function""?"
Must-have app But it doesn't seem to have the option to remove airline combinations like its website?
"This app was great before the update... now I'm not sure on what is going on but I have been trying to book for a flight and I can not find one flight, I try to use different days, time even 2 stop flights and nothing.. I even try different cities... and I just can get not flights."
"The app is OK but please add the option for fly out and back from the same airport on the android app. Being in London it's a pain having to do the searches by each individual London airport to get only the results out and back from same airport, which drives me to just search on the airlines websites instead. That function is already there on the website so no idea why it isn't on the app."
"Decent app but I never get the price suggested by the options given. Filter options on app should be a they are on the website. Like no airport change, no airline combination etc. One more filter should be type of aircraft 777, 787, 380 etc this would enhance my flight booking experience But still price suggested should be exact rarely it matches. We end up paying more."
"Tenen muchas opciones y muchos precios para el mismo destino .. es facil de usar y puedes configurar idioma, precios y otras cosas. Aunque constantemente esta actualizando los precios si dejas pasar mucho tiempo la recomiendo.."
"no longer able to select ""whole month"" under the ""Select dates"" section but there is no this issue with the web version. so please help resolve this issue the soonest possible on this app, if possible within 3 days. thanks"
"Good, sometimes they have really good offers Just hate the fact that sometimes when you Nooka. Flight it send you to different websites not Skyscanner."
"The new logo is disgusting, please revert asap. I loved this app until you changed the logo, planning to use other apps from now on unless you revert."
Gostaria de conseguir filtrar passagens que permitem despacho de bagagem. Sem esse filtro o alerta de altera√ß√£o de pre√ßos n√£o √© muito eficiente.
confusing most of the time. agree design and everything else is cool but ux it's really hard to get a grip on how things works.
app won't download. it was stuck on 30%. i downloaded hopper just fine
"No option to compare prices on different dates, a price graph would be better."
Only shows crazy expensive prices. Even airlines offer cheaper direct flights.
"I love it how Skyscanner personnel ""were not aware"" of unauthorised user data transmissions to Facebook. Perhaps the latter hacked their systems? Of course, we shall never hear an admission of guilt, but who needs it when it's so blatantly obvious. Uninstalled."

my go to for buying plane tickets every single time.
"Muy buena la App me ha servido de mucho cuando comparo vuelos, y aqu√≠ suelo encontrar promociones que en las p√°ginas o apps de aerol√≠neas no hay."
Why on the website it says Children under 16 but on the app it's under 12? On the app anyone 16 to 12 is an adult so ticket price is high but on the website it is cheap. A child is anyone under the age of 16. check before you book on the app.
"Latest update doesn't allow to add all passengers before searching for flights. Only can add passengers if I click on particular flight. This issue needs changing, it's annoying. Other than that love the app and using it regularly."
How come i get more search results on iphone than this Android App?
"Be aware, app tracks your searches and removes cheapest flight tickets, I found out about it recently looking for a flight to asia, use kayak or go incognito through Google website Edit: after dev. Reply, I can provide you with missing flights yet available in incognito mode from your website, didn't mean that someone removes flight but somehow they are missing as it happens to be the cheapest once as well, any ideas how it's possible?"
Used to love this app but since the latest update I'm not able to see my watchlist with every flight i had saved to check them later...pls get back to the previous version...
"The app was great once upon a time. It had a lot of useful functions, EG.: price widget, price comparison in a chart view. But the development team removed these features. In the current version it just knows what any other flight search knows. Nothing special. Sad thing. A lot of work to ruin a great app :-(."
you do get cheaper flights. the only problem when you click a credit card the price is bit increased from what you expected to pay.
"Familiar formatting that's easy to navigate. Unfortunately, they only list fights offered by United and no other competitors to compare costs. Found fights elsewhere for far cheaper comparatively."
"Great comparison use for flights and gaging estimate cost with minimal luggage. But i rarely book on the app. There needs to be a luggage filter (baggage allowance - e.g airlines providing 2 bags at 23kg on long haul!) I just use the site initially to discover the two airlines to book on their sites independently. It is annoying, especially because i use it for long haul so there's always 2 airlines - a stopover for connecting. A faff. Please make a baggage allowance filter on next app update!"
"Used to be a great, straightforward app, but with every update it seems to move away from that."
"best I've found for flying Aus-Philippines. Although when I click on the cheapest with short flight times, the original price is suddenly bumped up after selecting? Hopefully its a mistake or else I will uninstall and edit this reveiw?"
Disappointed with the lastest update I can't find the multi city option which was very convenient and easy to use !!
uso Skyscanner ormai da anni ed √® sempre la migliore soluzione per i miei spostamenti.
Changing doesn't always mean improving. Really unpractical after the latest update. üëéüèª
yes it shows cheap flights but when you plan to boom always getting message that the price changed
They have changed a really simple and brilliant search engine into something rubbish ! Who would get paid to authorise this ? I want the old version back too. IF YOU SEARCH GOOGLE FOR OLD SKYSCANNER APK .. IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THE PREVIOUS VERSION ( WITH MONTH/ YEAR VIEWS )
Had a friend recommend this app is the go-to for the best flight cheapest flights around finally got around to downloading it and all I got was a bunch of information about CO2 emissions and the prices and flights were about average with other sites that do the same thing but I was moved by all this talk about CO2 and realize that by flying at all I was contributing to global climate change so I decided not to fly at all and deleted the app because I have no use for it now
"Why there are no detail about the flight that used to be on iOS version that I previously used? I wanted to know how wide the passenger seat space and plane are, like I was able to find those data on iOS version. Please make that feature available on Android version too."
It's useful to use the price tracker to find the best time to buy... if it's accurate. When booking a recent trip I found the actual price of the flights almost double what the price alerts had been telling me. Not ideal for cost saving.
um dos melhores aplicativos para pesquisar pre√ßo de passagem a√©rea
the app and the site do not give the same information. I verified it for same days . there was a clear difference in price. the site gives better prices than app.. there is a serious flaw.. it was not a minor difference. 200 to 300 dollars for flight to Kuala Lumpur on Jul 2020 and return end of the month..
Befor it was easy to find cheap flights but now not..

easy to search. but sometimes the quick results do not match the details.
Used to be my favourite app but since the upgrade it's just irritating. I want to see starting point and destination on the same screen and not have to keep going back and forward. Bring back the old version.
previously I was able to choose only direct flight and see which days are cheap... now no...
"Cheating app, the app saves cookies in order to increase flight costs when making a second look at the same flight, I've tried in different smartphones and the price is different, ecen when searching for the same flight at the same time"
"The only reason i use Skyscanner because there used to be a home widget to advise the best price and date to go anywhere. Now the widget is removed, this app just became ordinary like any other flight search apps."
"It's OK. Sometimes it has the best prices, sometimes it doesn't. It doesn't update automatically, which is ridiculous in 2019. And I'm not convinced the clear history function actually works, based on its behavior."
The search feature is different compared to the website. Not able to search by whole month. Adding nearby airports or direct flights only is t as easy.
What happened to the car hire and hotel option ? Its changed completely !
"Worst logo and worst design with this update, but stay the best, please change the design"
"Does not show prices of flights for whole months like on the website, witch is the only reason I use Skyscanner. The app only shows range of prices and you have to choose the dates to see the prices instead of choosing date after seeing prices on the calendar. I guess i will have to keep using the website if i want to use Skyscanner services."
"The app is good but hotel icom is not working , whenever i try to click, it doesn't respond"

Offers you flights with cheapest price and best quality but the problem is that it's not easy to find round trip flight with different routes and stops

"Hotel and flight prices are higher when I'm logged in with my account vs. using the app (and website) incognito! That's called fraud.

"I found a great price for the tickets I was looking for, but the vendor offering them Sky-Tours is a scam.

It's quite an intruding little app for a ‚ÄòNotepad' It gives itself permition to access you accounts and contacts. Don't think of it as a simple text editor. It's not !! I definitely wouldn't use it to store any sensitive information on my phone.

"Could be a good app but the prices on my saved trips doesn't update & hasn't since I created them. Everytime I open the app, it shows the same price from 30 days ago. I don't see any feature to refresh it other than clicking into the trip & hitting check prices. Even after doing so, the price on the trip page still reflects 30 days ago. I thought the app would automatically refresh the prices on the saved trip page without having to click into it. Uninstalled."

"Searched for flights from LGW to Malmo, Sweden. Results show many different airports for my origin here in the UK. And it's multiple airports for origin for the same return flight, meaning it shows, for example, the flight leaves from LHR to Malmo, then return is Malmo to Stanstead. Insane. If I search for LGW it should ONLY show flights from and to LGW."
"new updated app is worse, how to select flights for the cheapest month, unable to find that feature, better to use google flights instead"
Wake up and smell the Chromebook. Its not new technology anymore. Why can I not browse flights from my Chromebook? its fine until the point you have to put in your destinations... then nothing? After your reply it still sucks... why would you reply something like that anyway. I update my apps regularly. Why not just admit your app is not for Chrome OS. There are other apps for flights you know.

"its good to compare flight tickets, but sone of the booking sites are not good. pl. put goid ,trusted booking sites."
"Normally i can see the price for all month, then i will decide which day i will love to travel and get better price.. But now its just same as other apps. Only price on the choosen date.. It make me waste alot of time.. Please do something"
"After a long time I gave Skyscanner another try. I installed it on my primary phone, running Android 9, only to find that I could not install it on my secondary phone, a OnePlus One running Android 8 (LineageOS). On that phone the app does not appear in the Play Store and shows as incompatible on the Play Store web site. I cannot think of any good reason for that."
"When booking YVR to MCO for February flights for 2020 it shows you cheapest 15 airfares. When you go to book the $339Cdn return airfare,skyscanner takes you to airlines website . then tells you a price adjustment error and so u accept the new higher price and brings you back to the lower price that u initially wanted. But it never allows you to purchase your tickets AMERICAN & United have looked into it and said its the Skyscanner app. So ive decided to go to the Hopper & Agoda app."
"Looks good, but can't log in using Google account. The application redirect to browser and show ""Check your network settings"" error message. Without logging in the application not very useful. Will uninstall it and install something more reliable."
The quote they give is $100 more for the same flight on orbitz or Expedia. I would be cautious trusting this app as finding the lowest price
I use it all the time for my flights all the others give prices but when you call not the same with skyscanner the price is the price

"Total and complete waste of time. Wish I could give negative stars. Can't filter out basic economy so it's totally useless. Download Hopper, much better app by far."
Feedback! Suddenly my saved flights will disappear randomly even if I have saved them just recently... Please fix the bug !
Oftenly these guys have deals that too good to be true and it is because it will be marked as sold out once youvey gone through all the trouble of keying in all the particulars. Besides this it's an OK apo

I would prefer website over app as the app hangs a lot and everhtime you restart you have to start from begining..once it stopped while i was making payment..
"After the update, there's no more multi-city option."
"Skyscanner now a days tied up with few agents which does not have any credibility, before buying the tickets ( cheaper than other options) , please do check the authenticity and feedback of individual agencies as there are many separate T& C applied. I think as an aggregator Skyscanner should xheck also the credibility of individual agencies and tie up onoy with trusted and credible ones."
"Rated 1 star because skyscanner listed BestJet, which had lost AFTA accreditation, with a 5 stars rating beside it. This had indirectly caused thousands of users, including me, who chosed to believe skyscanner, purchased their flight ticket through BestJet and thus lost up to tens of thousands of hard earned dollars. Skyscanner could have done better, that is, to remove every dodgy agents from their recommendations to better protect their users."

"It really does look at airliners, that dont show up, on bigger search engines. plus I have seen them, to be cheaper that expedia. One thing I wish they would do. Is to not show sold out tickets on searches. It just confuses people. Other than that good app."
Dont hace the option to search by months anymore...
"really poor, doesnt load up airports anymore. edit. ive emailed you screenshots via the link youve sent. thanks."

"good app. just having trouble with adding dates for notifications. some of the numbers of the days are being covered with the names of the months. please fix this glitch. I can't say the app is good for price alerts, because I can't click on the dates."
"Always changes prices, tracks your searches and makes it more expensive every search. Can use other websites to search and confirm prices. One search a return flight was estimated from 150 dollars once clicked it when up to a minimum of 10k dollars. New app design makes it more difficult to navigate. Will use something like kayak from now on. Don't waste your time searching and researching with this app."
"I give it 3 because, the app stil shows flight deals that are not available. It annoys me because it only stated the deals are unavailable when I'm about to make payments. It would be great if you'd filtered out the unavailable and only shows the available ones. Tq."
Return the feature that tells you how many days until your trip. This used to be in the trips section but is no longer shown.
"It was fine earlier, nowadays it is not at all showing aprropriate price and when you check the price u ll find an enhanced price, this will hamper the name it earned earlier."
what happened to this app. Used to be so good and in the last few months it's gone from 5 stars to 3. When u go to check deals and u click on a provider (mostly when u click the skysanner deal) it comes back saying that fare is no longer available. It does this more times than not and it sux because it just seems websites are saying the price is lower so that we do click on it only to be given the option to divert to their main site because the fare u wanted isn't actually available. Fix please

This app is really convenient until you find out that they charge different people different prices for no reason. Any flight my girlfriend searches will have a list of flight prices and times. When I search the EXACT SAME FLIGHTS I am charged at least 200 more and at least 10 hours more of travel. I've tried to contact these people but their phone number is very well hidden. I do not know why I am being over charged for the exact same flights or why my searches do not yield the same results.

The problem is often the headline figure given is that of travel agents without much of a reputation then if you look on airline website or reputable travel agency its much more. Should be able to select which agencies it scans.
the app has it's limitations to the website but some is second to none. Google destroyed ITA.
"Not bad per se, but unlike the website I can't seem to find the option to fly out & back using the same airport. I'm not sure why this isn't the default option anyway, with the option instead being to select using different airports for out & back - would've thought that was more useful to most people? Without that it made the app quite useless for me, so I've uninstalled."
The app tricks you to think it is a round trip but may not be.
"The only app where i always go to find the best deals in flying tickets... Stay away from sellers: eDreams that raise the total at the end due to time limit at checkout and charge even when you don't finalize tickets ExploreTrip that charge $30 for adjusting a name, require photo of Card used and letter of confirmation to clear payment ü§® PLUS cancel E-Tickets without notice, just for not matching ticket BUYER with person FLYINGüò°üò°üò° need some attention and dropped my 5 to 3 stars"
"Hi! I am currently downloading the app but for some reasons, it only says download pending. It is the only app I am downloading. Restarted playstore several times but still got the same response. Can someone help me? Thanks."
the phone is over heat. really high temperature while running this app. this kind of situation wouldn't happen by other apps including games.
It's a good app but can't put the amount of people travelling..it's annoying. I have uninstalled heaps of times
"I have been using this app for 4 years, the app has change I am uninstalling this app. This used to be my goto site for flight but not anymore the prices are too high."
"Used to really like this app, however it seems to get worse with every update, latest one being you can no longer save flights, only create price alerts. Edit: star seems to have changed to a heart, option to save comes up on some flights, but not all, especially when trying to select flight times for an airline that does multiple flights per day to a destination."
"Older version crashed when starting, got the newest version also crashed. Please fix because this WAS a 5 star app."
"Things appear to have gone down hill since the recent change. Used to be a solid 4/5 stars but no longer easy to use/navigate. The option for a multi-city flights trip used to be very easy and obvious. Not even sure you can do that now?! If it is I can't see it. If not, it ceases to be useful. Shame."
Theres no option for selecting whole month on the app. I always have to use the website
"I would use the website even from my phone. I don't like the way the flight options are displayed in this app anymore. Visually, it is more difficult for me to catch all of the information I need to make a decision. The website is better, it has the skyscanner style on the way the list of flights are presented, the app now is looking a lot like last minute flights app which I don't use exactly because of the way the list of flights is presented, ugly and plain."
"Does not show full aircraft detail for flights, some Information in show details is too generic. Ie 787 (widebody), please add full aircraft details like 787-9 as per cheapflights app."
"Great app at what it does but with some serious bugs too. I tried logging in. Eventhough the method was unusual, where you are redirected to a browser to login afresh instead of going through the Google accounts registered in the phone, the app here lagging right after that. Also, I can't create alert notification for flight prices. It shows a toast saying unable to create the price alert. After this, I'm automatically logged out. Tried it multiple times with no luck."
"found it easy and helpful. but when i check for the flight from the same place to the same destination the price varies everytime. it always goes high. one if my friend who booked a flight ticket at 390 gbp for the same flight is showing me ¬£500 & above, no matter how many time I check & the time I book. So much Disappointed for this. The price increment baaed on necessity. If I check for july/August/September in the month of april, still the prices are high. even for June there are high again."
frst time I on booking tickets here but baggage batton not here. baggage how to book here.
Sends your data to Facebook without your consent. Would give it Zero stars if I could
One big fault. It does not remember the amount of ppl for every saved search Please update me once fixed. Thanks
may get the ideas and can compare. but we have to make sure the rates are correct. because some of the ticketing agents routed by the app are not geniune and may divert us to a an expensive air tickets.
always when leave the app and comeback shortly the app doesn't load the destination anymore!! fix it please
Poor searching criteria - you cannot search direct flights when selecting a country to country option - you have to go into each city presented with the first round of results and filter direct flights at that stage.. wastes time. You can do this on the desktop so will use that instead of the app.
"This app is still a poor replacement for the actual website. From the search menu you cannot choose month instead of a day You can't easily choose destination as everywhere. Previously It was possible to quickly choose routes, month and the everywhere function. And then see a calendar or chart with all the options. Now we have pretty pictures and a horrible frustrating experience. Once a year I download the app, see if its improved. But as at December 2019, it's still a poor copy of the site"
Keep's crashing. Won't pas startup screen before crashing. Used to work fine. EDIT: Still crashes after re-installing.
I've been using this app for long time. But now i found they don't search anymore in low costs like Jet Smart. And i bought tickets in another airline loosing money
"clearly marked to avoid goldcar on the filter section and guess who my booking was made ...goldcar. whats the point? it should have been disclosed beforehand , specially if selected to avoid the company via filter. come on!!!!"
"I'm surprised of how worse the new updates get and keep going. Often the selected dates just change when I press search. Prices for destinations are nowhere near the first value. You select a destination, it tells you the price and then it doesn't find any flights. Or it says it doesn't find enough tickets: 1. Come on!? Skyscanner was so much better before the restyle üò£üòî"
This used to be my app of choice before they updated it. Now I can't search by cheapest month etc so I uninstalled it. Looking for a competitor recommendation.
"it's just that we are not sure of each provider's reputation. sky-scanner did not chexk their reputation, right? u have to do it yourself. go check out the reliability"
Booking sites that are used as sources perceive hidden fees. For example the lowest price with no extras is many times higher than advertised on Skyscanner. The caches are outdated and misleading
"Oh what have you done? This new version is no match for the previous version. The navigation is cumbersome and unnecessary. Who on earth makes these decisions to change things? I will be uninstalling and hopefully will find an apk of the previous version. You ask what could be done. Stop making these unnecessary changes and bring back the previous version, which is what i am now running."
"Since when Sunday is the first day of the week? Edit: regional settings in the app are set correctly (to my country, where week start on Monday). So my best guess is that it's a very irritating bug. Edit #2: you seriously can't fix a locale bug over two months..? The problem is that calendar checks locale from the set language of the app and NOT region you set your app. If you have trouble reproducing the bug, contact me and I will help you."
"Fast to find flights but this app delays the price changes and also I see more higher prices when goint to the official company website. I had selected notification feature but ,even I havent got price change alert."
"App won't allow me to search by country, only city, example I want to check cheap flights out of Scotland to Germany, I need to search from Glasgow... Then Aberdeen... Then Edinburgh.... To the countless cities in Germany..... Makes no sense at all!!!!!! Just another company kidding themselves on that they are wonderful when in reality they are rubbish. What will your development team do with the information?"
"Found less expensive flights on Expedia. Also, when I tried to book a flight on my phone, it kept saying that I had to ""choose how to proceed"" which didn't give me any indication on how to proceed. All of the programs that came up as options didn't actually allow me to book a flight. Seems like their app wasn't compatible with my phone."
I used to love skyscanner but recently when I try searching for flights it keeps saying no flights found. Like no flights anywhere... Clearly there are flights happening somewhere so this is definitely a glitch rendering the app useless.
Update is rubbish. The design is ugly but who cares when you cant even save flights to trips. Makes it pointless for someone trying to track a few different flights. May as well just use Google flights at least it works
"If your goal is just to find cheap flights, the app is useless. It wants to plan hotels and stuff too for you, and has less funcionality than the website."
Indeed Money saver. The only dislike is the price shown is not updated.
i bought a ticket last nite they send me the confirmation in few minuts that my ticket is been reserved but today afre waitnig all day when i cald them they told me sory the tickets are sold and i will get my money back in 3 to 5 working days it means i can not buy another ticket until i get refund
hotel options doesn't work and if you once tap on hotels option first then flights option also doesn't work. edit- they have resolved this issue.

What happened to the cabin class search option? Function is on the website but nolonger on your app
three stars now previous problem sorted . However very frustrating when searching flights knowing if check baggage is included. often once into final booking phase you are told that there is not any checked baggage booked and no options to include it. Please add a filter so only flights with checked baggage are showing
"I cannot set the parameters for my plan, I can only set the number of travellers for a flight (which completely changed prices for me) and for accomodation separately. So I cannot ""get inspired"" for two adults at all. Probably I won't use this service for accomodation that way."
the price you get showing and the actual site is different ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ shows 400 pounds for the flight actual site is 470 ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ whats the point
Used to be great but this upgrade makes it unusable. Can't find the multi trip option. Layout is poor.
"The new visual update is very basic looking, logo is a smart idea but looks basic. No share button to allow you to share hotels to friends or family to view before booking. Having to take a screenshots that do not attach a link is not ideal. Also not having the option to favourite hotels to look back through at an easy glance is also not ideal."
"rates for international flights are expensive compared to other search engines like kayak, price line etc. I never tried to use this app for domestic flights"
Faulty Thai bath currency setting. edit: You should tell user to reopen the app to make the change to take effect!
"Totally worthless app! I am in another country and when I try to update my profile, it gives me all the choices in a foreign language! I speak English! Why can't I have the profile in my native tongue? I will find an app that works!"
very inaccurate pricing. found the same flights much cheaper on other sites. disappointing
The first place I go to look for flights. The only downside is that the prices indicated does not take into account 3rd party site additional cost
"Initial experience is very confusing. I was not looking for a ""travel agency"", but that's how the app presents itself. I want a flight search engine, and that's all,"
"The app seems to have updated, it takes a lot more steps to get to the list of flights now. I start with 2 passengers and by the time I get to the list of flights its only saying the price for 1 passenger. I have to manually change back to two when I select a flight. The new update made things more complicated than they used to be and a little bit frustrating."
when redirected to book a flight at the Porter and Expedia sites the price had changed and was still not reflected on Skyscanner hours later. How long does it take for price changes to show up in Skyscanner? It's not worth using this app unless the prices are in real-time!
"Multi-city is poorly done. You should allow to chose different classes and if direct, 1 stop or 2 stops for the individual legs. Otherwise the multi-city is a tool that can't be really used. Cheers"
It would be worth 5 stars if I would be able to reset the calendar to start the week on Monday instead of Sunday. It's so darn annoying and confusing for weekend travelers.
"Not sure your app is longer useful after the level of add-on the carriers have evolved making your fee comparisons no longer fit for purposes (you can compare an Iberia trip with a Ryanair because whilst in one you can bring your cabin trolley, in the second you can only place your two hands in pockets)...despite your disclaimers. Shame!"
"for some reason, all my saved flights has been deleted from my account. Then, i try to add it again. then it will dissapear again. please revert back to the previous version."
"This is one of those rare situations where the app is inferior to the mobile website. While it is a pain in the butt to continue going to the website each time I want to use this service, I find the app clunky and simply not as functional. The website allows you to search flights by month and see prices for each day during that month. This app only allows viewing prices by color (red for high) similar to other flight apps such as kayak. I will continue using the website and uninstall the app."
the widget is gone! this useful feature to track travel plans is no longer available. At least inform us why a major feature has been removed.
"Bought ticket & credit card charged. Able to see under upcoming trips but when i click, it says ""sorry, something went wrong"". Uninstall and reinstalled. Clicked again, able to view. Then refreshed, and back to being ""sorry, something went wrong"" Not sure if my ticket has really been confirmed or not... @_@"
Does not show an obvious way to only watch one way flights.
some odd permissions for a booking app. why does the app require permissions for wifi settings and other connected devices? in what way is that relevent to booking a flight?
This has been my go to app for many many years. However this latest update is just incredibly and unnecessarily difficult to navigate. I'm going to try the website and hope for better but it's a shame as I've uninstalled the app. What annoyed me most was the fact you're forced to click buttons and cannot use app in sections like it used to. Change for the worse and I hope it gets an update soon as I have a lot of faith in the Skyscanner brand that wont be shaken by one awful update.
"Multi city option does not work when trying to book cabin class. if you try to book first of business, and just one of the flights doesn't have that option, it will say no flights available, instead of giving me the option to say yes to economy on that one short haul flight and first for the other flights."
Latest update done it for me. No longer does it show you prices when you select anywhere you have to click on individual countries. Whom has thought about that silly thing? Ruined it for me.
Stopped using this app about a year ago after it updated from useful and easy to cluttered and complicated. Thought I'd see how it's improved but it's clearly gone the other way. Terrible app
"What happened to the user interface?? They absolutely ruined it! Not in anyway helpful. Just use the website, way better experience."
Slow. Issues with results until clearing and re-applying filters.
gives low price then sends you to sight who then say error etc..
"Price are different when u click the website ! much much more expensive, very dissapointed!"
5* to 3*. App acknowledges muti person searches but then shows price for single person. Not as transparent as previously used. Will stick to website
Skyscanner what have you done to a great app. The price monitoring of flights no longer works
it was a very 1st time i used this and got so many issues. Keeps loading and after the transactions has been made i just got a confirmation that cannot be proceeded due to authirization of payment. Whats happening in this way. I have no issues with thw bank.
"My go to app for finding flights. Unfortunately the hotel search is unusable for families. I can only search for for a room based on the number of adults, rather than being able to search for 2 adults and 1 infant like I can on Trivago and others."
"I am really disappointed with the latest iteration of the app. It used to be superb, but is now trying to be too smart and has lost a lot of the functionality. I usually am trying to find flights for me and my family, but can't see where to change the number of passengers until after flights are chosen. Also, it only tells the cheapest flight in any given month, rather than indicating cheaper and more expensive days to help inform choices. Please get this sorted as it's currently no good."
"I don't see the benefit of having this app. I just looked for a fare RdTp EWR to SXM(Saint Maarten) on this app, $370 non-stop there but with a 16hr return on another airline. When I tried to change the first leg to a Rd tp with the first airline it jumped to $631. Wow, that's a shaving not a saving. Went straight to United RdTp non-stop $360. Why would I want to use this app again? Am I missing something here?"
"The app doesn't let you remove undesirable airlines (I.e Spirit and frontier) like the website. And currently as I write this, the website shows results from southwest but this app isn't. Sigh. I'll just stick with the website"
Wow those prices were terrible. better off buying directly from the airline for $400 cheaper!
Uninstalled in 30 seconds Why when your website is very usable can you not design a user friendly app ? Even worse than your last app. Back to using the website.
once app but the main reason I got this app was to search a a month block but this is not available :(
Updated app and now keeps crashing. Too bad because this is how I always book my trips. I guess I have to try a new app now.
"I tried Skyscanner and found it not very good.  Plugged in a roundtrip from Local City to Washington Dulles.  Matched its results against Expedia.  This is where everything failed.  Came up with different prices and had to go way down the list to find my outgoing flight. Selected it and then return screen would only show me the same airline coming back.  Pricing was $150 higher then Expedia directly.  Seems with this scenario, it will only show same airline going and returning which in the real world is not always the cheapest fair and cheap price is not always cheapest to fly.  You have to take also into consideration now baggage fees and flight times"
"I don't use this app frequently, maybe two-three times per year, so I was shocked how it was changed. For me it is confusing and sometimes annoying and not functional anymore. Please bring back the old visualization where the timeline was horizontal and ticket prices were vertical, so I could really optimize price and date at the same time. Now I have to select where to go and when, and application will send me a price alert if cheaper price will be available. It doesn't help a lot."
"is not worth buying tickets from them, I bought the ticket for May 4 but gave us on May 5, when I called and talked to a consultant he said he would pay my money or I would ticket, eventually returned 3.96 Euro out of 75 !!!"
The latest update has ruined the best app for searching flights.. they removed the feature that allowed you to view the cheapest flight to your destination on every day then allowed you to make a selection. Now very hard to use !
"if this it's the original Skyscanner, it's a crazy lost of money who sell you this upgraded logo and app Sistem destroy everything what makes you useful. just find cheap flights no more people don't use this apps to book any stupid add-ons bad bad bad business decision. and the logo OMG please seems like a dairy company logo just need a cow and complete the logo they just copy n' paste from google"
it became very inconvenient after the update when I search flights. you guys can add an option to select between new interface and old one.
"sometimes can't find certain airports, worst CDG not in the list"
Slow to load. I went away and made a cup of tea! The filters wouldn't work so clicked back and it had lost the search! So tried again but so slow to load that I gave up.
Where is the trains function on the updated app? Was updated yesterday and it's not there
I had to get a refund from your service provider getafligh coz yesterday they confirmed my booking and today they emailed me that the flight is no more within the amount you paid we can book it on the next day within the same fee. What the hell !!!
"App is downright useless now compared to what it was in the past. And i only look for flights, not sure about other features. At least web wersion is still accesible."
Hate the new version 7.0 which automatically installed even though I didn't want it to. Have deleted it and want to re-install ver 5.7.3. How do I do that safely?
booking via app is not cheaper option ... please exclude that
"Terrible app (doesn't compare to the website) I really hate the Sky scanner app. I have tried to use it so many times (often using the website and having a good experience) and every time I leave frustrated. It doesn't let you select the whole month to find the cheapest flight, which to me is the only thing that makes skyscanner better than other flight compare sites/apps. I also find it shows me less options, and often more expensive than the skyscanner website, which is just weird."
Only having email notifications DAILY is ANNOYING! Can't use this app anymore until there's an option for push notifications AND an option to choose the frequency of notifications for watched trips.
the app caught using my camera in the background while i don't give permission. why do you need to use camera anyway?
"When I try to log in, it brings me to an Amazon login page. Enter info, it says not logged in and cycles back to log in page. Is this a scam trying to get Amazon log in info?"
The prices for flights that you can actually book are always around 200‚Ç¨ higher than the prices advertised. Doesn't help you with finding the right prices at all.
useful tool. Bit more in depth than goggle flights.
"Lots of installation issues with this app lately. It'll download and never install, not begin the download, etc. Always takes several tries. No problem with all my other apps. Have now flushed cache, Force Stopped Play Store, rebooted, seven attempts and cannot install. This is the third update in a row I've had this problem."
"How come the calendar is not correct??? like June 18,2019 is a Tuesday. But in this app, June 18,2019 is a Sunday! is there a way to adjust this????"
"Skyscanner used to be my one stop solution for all flight booking needs (and I'm a frequent traveler). But has become appallingly bad in the last few months. Different fares on Skyscanner and booking site, flights no longer available after having me fill in all personal and payment info. I'll be uninstalling the app and moving to another platform."
half the website's they're referring you to have hidden charges or the price simply changes
The app gives you limited access in comparison with the website and you cannot check cheapest month like the website
"I made a flight tickets reservation from this app, it showed me the price in the beginning, but when the payment was processed on the website, an extra 50 USD were withdrawn. i was so disappointed, but when i contacted the support team of skyscanner they followed it up with the agency and returned the difference in less than 12 hours."
The app doesn't find flights which the website finds easily. It's built well but the search is bad. Following the response... The new app doesn't allow me to search the entire month anymore. I saw your response to another customer but it isn't an option.
"The new UX is a downgrade. The search screen now doesn't let us continue from where you left off. Having the new ""wizard"" search ux sucks because if you go back you have to re-input all your choices. Bring back the old search page."
"Its level of flights are going down , the options of flights are worse then flighthub an Calgary flights are only cheap when its round trip but Vancouver one ways are cheaper which also I dont understand? This app was good but the updates seem to have made it worst ."
Why change it ? I had been using the app for years but now it is different and much more confusing to use. Why the need for change ?
Hate the new look app. Was so easy to use first and now cumbersome.
Size of this app is getting out of control. Every update swells it even further. Becoming far too cumbersome now to retain.
great but there is no notification regarding price change
It would appear the update doesn't allow you to see the prices in graph form. Specific dates only. We don't all require specific dates.
"humans are worse the RATS and skyscanner is no exemption. they know I travel a lot and the algorithm is always trying to get high prices. I did exactly the same search lodged in, different browser and the one that goes incognito TOR gives the lowest price for exactly the same fight and dates and time. plus when click to next screen that shows all possible fights and prices, its price is increased above 9% from the calendar plus when go to book the ticked its even more expensive. RATS"
"Yesterday I was searching for a flight ticket from LAX going to DEN,and I used this crappy app.I found the ticket,and ready for the payment,but the web page won't came out,it just keep processing,and then finally it told me the ticket I'm looking for is no longer exist,ok then,I used another app ordered another fight ticket,but then I received 2 e-mails from 2 different airlines!I bought 2 tickets!And both of them are basic economy seats which means I probably won't get the refunds!damn the app!"
Not up to the mark I want 1 stop flight And shows 2 stops
Without being able to add baggage in the search the app is much more difficult than others like Kayak
theres a green yellow and red marker to say how cheap the flights are but yet they are all wrong sometimes the red are cheaper then the green this seems broken and need to be fixed
budget air has rendered this search engine useless. literally every single flight i search for is undercut by budget air and it always turn out to be a misleading add!
"It used to be awesome but now it sucks balls. Cluttered with a bunch of useless information I don't care about. I used skyscanner to check on cheap flights, nothing more. Now not only is it troublesome to do so quickly, even finding the app has become a chore because some moron decided they had to change the logo to something diametrically different. Final drop, I'm going to use another flight finder."
"I'm a bit disappointed with the update. The ""save this flight"" option doesn't work anymore, I always get an error. Used to be a great feature to check pricing."
"Completely inacurate pricing. Skyscanner quotes ""lowest estimated price*"" but the actual price usually ends up being +$300-$400 more than estimated. This app is a total waste of time so I am deleting it."
"I am looking for flights, not to be upsold holiday packages, but unfortunately Skyscanner doesn't seem to be a good place to get flights anymore."
"Hi Skyscanner, I actually booked a flight yesterday but, one thing I dont understand due to they dont send an email after I booked. I have not received any email, I'd checked my bank account then I found that it was already despensed. Please help me, and make time for this matter."
Quite food but does not give info related to buggage
"would give lower if it were possible. pressed the wrong date as i said i was paying. Contacted immediately (same minute) as the payment was pending and wanted to change the date yet i sat waiting until it went through before they told me they dont change flights, names or refund tickets. basically 0 allowance for anything and will just pocket your money. look it up but DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THEM."
I can't get this app to give me ANY results when I search for flights that I need.
the plane was delayed for two hours but no update at all.
"you need to put pressure on your partners . booked with gogagte.ie but ticket increased by 25.41 at payment done. because i selected visa credit card. there was no pop up, no notice nothing. and i have to dig in after booking to find out how the hell price went up."
the changes to the search facility are awful. put them back. my recommended departure airports are all in Scotland despite the fact ive searched from newcastle a million times. poor update.
not able to see share icon in mobile app. because of icon colour
"I used this app for many years, time to uninstall and find an alternative flight finding app.You have ruined it. Used to be great but now the new app is terrible. You used to be able to find the cheapest day to fly but not any more, now it's the same as every other app. Such a shame. Why didn't you leave it alone. You have lost this customer of many years."
New app: poor interface. Too much tapping to get to a screen with times and prices.
"Does not give the cheapest fares of all, as advertised"
"very few options are functional in this app, not able to book flight, hotels. improvements needed."
Got rid of the rating sorting system in the latest update :(
"It is showing flights, but when I click on them it says there are not enough tickets. Then don't show them and waste my time."
Newest update is rubbish. It does not give all options preffered old version
it used to be great now it is useless every time I set up a search alert... I get emails with the itinerary or search alert changed. don't like it anymore
"not giving actual prices, but using sketchy travel agencies as feeders for low fares. It became useless after the last update where you are hiding the seller name."
Phone just warned me this app was detected using permissions in the background for the camera
You get one price in the search but when you click on the site to book you get a completely different price. This has been an issue for years. I'm not sure how anyone could be giving positive feedback when there is such a huge issue with this
"The last update is so disappointing. Logo looks like weather app. Start up flight searching separated pages (dates, where to, from where) are inconvenient. Please, revert to previous searching modes as before using convenient search from 1 page all-in-one: date, to, from, quantity of passengers etc."
After update I can't go directly to multicity search
Price shown on the app is not accurate while trying to do the booking. Hiked by 100usd
Complicated. Results are difficult to understand. Doesn't give opitions based on reduced cost/fare properly.
"There is a bug in Android mobiles. After clicking on See more flight deals, the scroll doesn't work. It doesn't display all the trips and prices for 3 months."
"Lack of option to show airport nearby is not good, especially when your website have it."
"This was my go to service when my family was traveling around the world on the cheap last year. Now, they are scammy like many other services I avoid. By this I mean you search, see a very low price result, click, see it's actually much much higher, click again and even higher. They will say it's just ""estimated"" prices on the first result. Why? Your giving me the actual list of prices eventually.. terribly disappointed. Uninstalled and done."
"Unfortunately, this app is a joke! I have tried to book a flight 3 times from different sites. The prices ridiculously change after you try to confirm and book them out."
I am unable to find the show whole month icon. Previously the show whole month icon was available showing the estimated fares of the whole month. But now cant find it
have had this app for a while but I am now getting reports through the security on my phone and it's to tell me skyscanner is using my camera in the background when my phone is not in use very concerned with the privacy issue now
"Something really gone wrong since couple updates ago. The search for flights to ""everywhere"" simply stopped offering any suggestions (I mean literally none!). Too bad as it's my most common method of searching for possible flight destinations. Will probably keep looking on other platforms."
"What have you done to your app? The latest update is really bad. Let me know when you have reverted back to the old one, then I will use it again."
The worse application.i booked a tickets 2days ago. they charged me a price. then they changed it after 2 days. GUYS J DONT RECOMMMMEEEEND THIS APPPP.
sometime the ticket flight agents are not update latest prices
"Development is going in the wrong direction. Tried to do a DEPARTURE AIRPORT > COUNTRY flight search on specific days only to get an unhelpful ""Explore"" page which is blank except for one destination tile. Not very helpful and not what I expect when I try a search within the constraints of the engine. Using Skyscanner less and less because of these counterintuitive quirks."
The app took me to a Fraud Website. I booked the ticket and I haven't got the eticket but just the payment slip.This app is a fraud app as well i suppose.
The flight are more expensive than book in the official airline website.
very slow app not cover all airlines only few airlines.
Reserved flight and found out that my purchase never went through via email the next day. Had to rearrange plans and scramble to get another flight. Is that Skyscanner's fault? I don't know but first impressions last a long time.
"Some among the suggested by Skyscanner are fraudulent. Be cautious. Recheck the reviews of such sites and book. If u book through Skyscanner, refunds will be bit tougher to get."
"i did flight booking via skyscanner,happygoeasy portal,4tickets,money got deducted,its almost 24 hours,but no communication from them,No PNR generated, i mailed them twice ....why do you allow such portal on skyscannner? take immediate action and get my flight booked ASAP or be ready to face the next step in consumer court.i checked with indigo airlines,no booking is done on my name"
booked flight via skyscanner and the original website was a fraud. The price shown at the time of booking was lower than the amount deducted from my account without any notice.
You may get a cheap flight but with them using very dodgy third party sites you will most likely get screwed over in the process better to use a real app like kayak or cheapoair
"No longer works since it started bringing back fictitious prices from 3rd party flight search engines which make you click to get to their site. Sort it out, Skyscanner!"
"I can't select fly in and out of same airport in the app, also doesn't show me more than 2 results?"
the new update for explore (everywhere) messed things up!! when clicking on a ticket it says from (price) you enter and cant find it.
"Frustrating, unusable. Ive used Skyscanner for years. Always my goto site for flights. Tried to book a flight today and the experience was awful. I understand that you need to generate an income from my visit, but Ive just given up and will do a manual search - or use a rival instead. So sad to see."
Worst app ever. Prices are changed every second and not because they really changed. The app learns where you're planning to fly and suddenly the price increases.
"Since the new update, the app keeps loading. It's not working."
"Very first time i booked my air ticket through skyscanner, which was diverted to TRIPAIR online booking site, my money laready deducted, and after almost 2 weeks of booking i received message from tripair that your booking have been canceled by airline, when enquired about my refund. They replied it will take 30 days, my concerns is this is not the mistake of customer than y it will take 30 days. Very very bad experience"
"useful app. unfortunately once it collected cookies and know what yiu want, it will sell tickets more expensive. done same search form different devices and got difference"
"didn't explain clearly, maybe trap from app cos when I was booking flight from bkk-KKC(‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏ô) Ur app just show only date and month , Ur app didn't show year of booking, as the result, I miss the flight today and my booking is on next year. So, I think it just a little problem on U but I,m surly ur customer may leave ur like me."
uninstalled due to its sharing of users details with Facebook.
The new update removed the wigget and it look like they are not putting it back i sent numerous of emails in regards to this and no one responds the wigget was the best cuss you we're able to see prices and dates and you would just select the one you found was best for your time and money now you have to go in and search and search for special this sucks
"dysfunctional. Nothing happens when i click either the airplane, hotel, or car rental icons to search. i had the app for about a month and now all the sudden it's not working. Now i may have to ditch this app, cancel the membership, and go elsewhere. such a shame as I was still exploring it's different features and services"
can you fix the date options. choosing a date closes the the date menu and returns to home page. so annoying
I've been trying to download this app since morning but it's not downloading. It's not responding at all.
"Fails to load images and ratings, plus it uses alot of battery"
i have booked a ticket now and the amount has been deducted from my account but i am yet to receive the tickets or any confirmation for the same. need you to look into this asap
too much options to click and the system is slow to respond
app does not distinguish ticket prices for infants ve adults hence charges adult rates for infants
Used my camera without permission. Deleting immediately.
"Why you adding websites like akbar tavel,,, air fare check karte hai to akvar travel sabse kamm btata hai,, per jab unki website per redirect hota hai to 4 times jyada rates kar dete hai wo,total timewaste,, pls remove this site from ur search data,,,"
"I would commit murder, the app deliberately defaults to the wrong date when you input information so that you turn up at the airport on the wrong date. It's done this on me 3 times and I feel it's deliberately done so you book more last minute flights at higher prices. today I lost 900 pounds. I've tested on three android devices and it did that same on all three. scum"
"Crop. Most of the deals are outdated and when you get to the booking website, the deal is already gone plus search is way too slow"
sends data to facebook. don't like it!! deinstalled the app!
"pointless!! This app does not show all airlines, it omits the cheapest Airlines, WHY!!"
very poor site how it is possible to make a site such a poorest one
Real prices NEVER MATCH with this app. It's a waste of time.
Filtering is bad. App insists on taking flights that take longer than travelling by coach.
I need to get in touch with you guys. i just booked a flight and did not receive any confirmation. my money is deducted and i just called the airline company they confirmed that they did not receive any booking. i booked a flight from Mumbai to Kochi
It doesn't give any alert for price drop. Its a big lie.
The app recorded 49 second video in the background of my phone - removed app. There was no reason why this should be recording videos
this app needs to be more flexible. I can't change my currency. It always shows the currency that I don‚Äôt want. disgusting
I hate the new logo of 23 sep version .. super ugly ..
some features are missing like fluid dates and monthly price table or graph
Please remove BudgetAir from your website they haven't returned my refund since May even though Cebu Pacific already returned the money. SHAMELESS!!!
You people completely cheat people. Shame on you.. i was trying to book flight and and last moment i see that its only hand baggage fare. While in the other website same price was mentioned without handbag fare.. And atlast it was written in small words 0kg check in bag. So what will happen if it booked without noticing . Shame on you once again
Crashes a lot. Exits without giving desired information. It seems the issue it is linked to the facebook SSO.
"Terrible experience. Even though you do find the cheapest flights, I was never able to pay for any of the options! I tried thousands of times through different sites and payment options but it always declined my cards (with enough funds) or told me the flight I wanted was sold out but then would show me the same flight after refreshing! Never using this app again."
It does not work. It doesn't show even a quarter of flights from a chosen airport in a chosen time frame.
"Major invasion of privacy! just been notified the app has been detected using my camera, when that permission is turned off. major invasion of privacy!!! I would like a response asap please to explain"
"Since the update, it's got so confusing and a lot worse. This phrase springs to mind ""if it's not broken, don't fu*king fix it"". Any chance we can have a choice of having the old 5* Skyscanner back rather than this ""downdated"" version? Or will you be sticking your middle finger at loyal customers like myself? It's such a shame you'll be forcing me to go somewhere else considering I've used you guys from the beginning."
I tried so many times to book my flight and it keeps on increasing the prize. I hate it!
Everytime I try to book the booking fails after deducting the money from my account
worst app which keeps track of your personal data and downloads Cookies on the device to generate more money for airlines companies. uninstall uninstall uninstall
Ummm.... I hate everyone for not telling me about this a long a** time ago!!!! Seriously do you know how much traveling I would've done by now!?!
"As per latest study Skyscanner app is sending user personal data without permission to facebook. They responded to this just by saying ""weren't aware"" üò° Its a privacy nightmare."
"The app is getting crashed , when I hit the back button after checking the flights list."
I would give this app zero if I could. For some reason it uses the camera on your phone. Received alert that is was using without permission. What would it need to use the camera for. Removed app immediately. HUGE privacy issue !!!
There is something wrong with the app. No matter what date I select it says no flights available. Fix this please.
search for flight showing no result...worst experience
"Does not work on my Kindle anymore , What's happening guys...???"
o have to edit this as it is now even worse ..utter shite ffs.. now no prices are seen on calendar or bar chart .. and now I can not use any of the old apps. why ehh why idiots
"The new version is so bad that it is a torture to find a suitable flight now. It used to be very practical and user-friendly, but not anymore. You need to talk to your app developers and find out who decided to make the app like this and why. Super disappointing."
had to uninstall after a few minutes of use... ui is useless
"This is the worst update ever in all kinds of apps. I have using your app for the last 5 years,but this new update is embarrassing really. Goodbye"
It doesn't give an information when the prices fall. It only gives information when the prices has increased. This is so annoying.
They put all these ridiculous self-transfer flights at the top of my search. Who the heck wants to switch airports to catch a connecting flight!?!
"Skyscanner sent my flight detail to random email that isn't mine. That email is completely random and not even the one I used to book the flight. It's very unsafe since random people/email got all my flight details. When I check the booking ID to the airlines (air asia), said my flight detail has been sent to random email and they could not find my flight detail through the booking ID Skyscanner gave to me. Skyscanner please read my emails and cancel flight + refund my ticket !!!"
The filters work HORRIBLY. COME ON ALREADY. And the feedback form doesn't work. What else can you screw up?
"be careful with this app. they have sites like travelgenio which offers ""cheap deals"" full of trickery and no customer service"
"1 star because your App starts automatically after an update, which is annoying as hell, especially when you're writing something and all of a sudden this app stops you from doing what you were doing. I wonder what the intent of an auto launch is other than annoying the hell out of people"
ibk bank payment is not working. can you help me how to make payment for my booking. i tried many times but still my card payment didnt work.. here in korea.
"The last update is confusing and takes longer to enter all information again every time you seek flights, you really messed up a great application."
"This is the worst app I've used. I spent hours trying to book flights. I tried on phone and PC. One agency constantly says ""something went wrong - try new dates"" and the other agency takes me all the way to payment but payment never works. I rang one agency and they were quick to tell me I could pay over the phone but the price had gone up $400. On a previous booking I paid for seats in advance which were never provided. There is something up with all this. I have given up on Skyscanner."
Is there a way to do flight search that AVOIDS USA? Flying or transiting through USA is a Major inconvenience to some travellers because of the Transit visa issue.
"i tried to purchased tickets through this app, and when i was ready to pay for my tickets with Smartfare it said there was an error when trying to buy the tickets and that i had to call customer service, why would i call customer service? if i already know where,when and how i want to travel. Waste of time!!! never using this app again."
Doesn't work at all. Tells me the server has dropped me off.
this app needs updating too often. too many ads also irirritating
Doesn't work no city or country to select only flying dates. What a waste
the days are wrong in the calender part of your app. they are off by two days making it very difficult to search and plan
I will change my rating when you add the option to exclude some air companies in a profile. For example I will never use again Ryanair... not even for free!!!
can look and see the price but when want to book the payment page cannot load properly the expired date of the credit card keep on INVALID DATE... so annoying omg!!!! how to key in valid expired date... what the format!!!!????
"personal data sharing with facebook without my permission - not cool and should be investigated for violation of laws. Uninstalling now, and will advise anybody I know to do so as well."
Why i can't pay it?!! I tried a lots time but its doesn't work!
Bad UX and hit one nasty bug that caused it to offer me incorrect dates. Clicking on the calendar view that shows the price ranges doesn't work properly.
"Its become sluggish, useless, without price indications, hard to navigate am disappointed I just uninstall the app after 5 years of using a perfect app"
"This app just didn't work. took several attempts to find ""london"" as ""from"" and gave up after several more attempts to enter ""malaga"" as destination. Poor."
I tried do a booking money deducted from my account But it crashed while directing to merchant I had to make a lot of calls for retrieving the booking A ver bad experience
"Now a days it started to crash like anything, literally my phone get stuck when I am trying to use sky scanner, it never happened before, very much disappointed"
"Some booking site cant trust, budget air charge my card and cancell my booking , more than 25 days no refund......"
I can't download the App. is there anything wrong with it please?
"the worst apps I never seen, customer service more worst the hang up the phone if the want I missed my flight I try to call them they don't even wanna help me the hang up three times on me they charge me again full price, please people don't book flights through this apps they are scams they just take your money no help..."
"redirecting to tuniu site makes so much trouble, as it is chinese site, and not able to translate"
They just removed the best option with the last update! üëøüëøüëø We can't see prices for the whole months at one anymore! Skyscanner you sucks!!
Hate the new look.. i can not select multiple passengers on my search.. also page layout crappy .. don't like it anymore
What happened with the option to book train tickets? I can't see it anymore.
Very hard to follow price changes and the prices shown are not the most recent prices. So useless.
Very poorly designed. This application is extremely difficult to use and it is full of bugs. Stick to the website!
Disappointed with the new app hard to navigate and not user friendly. Not sure how to scan multiple city flights.
"Misleading , prices are never right. get emails saying the prices have gone down which are lies"
the app is crashed whenever it showed the price list
THIS IS SCAM. WHY IT'S USED MY CAMERA ONCE I STARTED IT?? FOR WHAT??
"Guys, what's going on? First a weird rebranding making the brand more distant to your users. Now displaying prices one way only?! Come on... Please stop working against UX and get your basics back together."
Security notified me that this app used my camera while it was running in the background and my phone was asleep. This app does not even have permission to use my camera. Don't install this app if you care about privacy.
Don't like the update AT ALL. Any way I can go back to the old version please?
this new version is so bad I can't find very well old version is better
it's been disappointed when I booked flight with emirates airline at the end I found oprated by fly dubai I didn't understand why I pay more money than fly dubai now I'm stuck trying to change travelling date no option to change when I'm calling fly dubai office no one is taking responsibility still I'm trying to call emirates airline it's same and dear Skyscanner when you email someone please send reservation number or refrance number not only ticket I'D please
You directed me us to Depkey that gave us false tickets and stole our money. About 3000 passengers were deceived by Depkey . You and Wego should have dealt with trusted people only. We are your victims.
I hate the cluttered new look....just looks like you are trying to upsell everything! Horrible UI/UX.
Simply fooling people by showing fake prices. Showing ticket price for an adult but charging same amount for an infant.
showing wrong price and after completing transaction I did not got confirmed ticket and It is taking too much time to give refund.
"Lately the app has been completely useless as prices don't match up when clicking through to book a flight. If this is intentional on the part of the company, then it's purely fraudulent."
"Terrible decisions with new branding... UX, Logo, colors, responsiveness..You destroyed it all :("
worst app ever. dont book . its a scam. it will redirect to a 3rd party site and they will take the money but wont confirm your ticket. happend with me with bravofly. will sue this app in consumer court and bravo fly too. very disappointed and dissatisfied.
"Are you still sending my data to Facebook without my consent? And stop sending me emails about flights to Addis Ababa- I have no wish to go there, I only did one search for a friend."
please remove rehlat from your list. they have scammed me for real. filing a case with Dubai police for promoting scam sites.
dont add the HAPYEASY GO travel sagency offers in this genuine site.. hppyeasy go very ig cheater. looting peoples
"Terrible. Just installed on android and doesn't work! Tried booking a flight several times, nothing, blocked. Useless"
Bro........you shot the app clean in the face with some sort of cannon.
I booked a flight through this app and when I got to the airport I did not have a ticket ready for me because the app never payed the airline. A lot of money was spent on a useless flight. No one should use this app. They are shady and will not take responsibility for their actions.
"Disappointed with the app, it feeds you to a third party and then the third party says the ticket at that price is no longer available. Just terrible. Uninstall Now!"
disappointed they share information with Facebook without asking my permission
"It was a terrible experience booking a return return to KUL as it lead us to scoot and we was unable to make any payment(payment got declined) and unable to change the currency modes, and no options available to book a two way tickets mapshot. Please don't take this lightly, this is something you guys have to look into, as you guys wouldn't be bearing our flight cost as well...."
New user experience i dont like. Hard to compare prices to a location over a period of time
"I hate the new update, they've taken away the multi city search and you can't change cabin class! Why remove functionality? Deleted."
"Why do none of these sites let me specify a single room? Even the word ""dorm"" annoys me!"
Skyscanner uses Exploretrip a fraudulent company therefore Skyscanner must be a fraud too. Exploretrip took my flight money and canceled my trip with no refund. SCAM ALERT: BUYER BEWARE
"I can't save anything. What's going on?? I can't save the flight tickets. It is just saying 'something went wrong'. So, what is wrong??"
"am i missing something? very unfriendly UI wont register any trips no alert modes, no nearby airports, no map? how does this have a decent rating."
"like this app, i dont appreciate however when they ask me to share my opinion about things or make me rank things"
Prices are just plain wrong. What's the point in have price alerts when the price isnt genuine in the first place. Uninstalling this waste of space.
Since it's been updated it is harder to use and will not be using again
Heard recently that a lot of people have been duped by fake agents aligned to Skyscanner. This has faded all trust i had for this application. A no if people have filed compalints for the same. Uninstalling the app as not trustworthy!
It's rubbish It has none of the functionality the website has
not as good as the websites I have found sucks and over priced
The departure/arrival time filters are unidirectional and extremely annoying.
Too many undeclared amd hidden charges with no recourse to correct.
New design looks worse and how do I look at prices for the whole month by day now?
Prices never match and it sends you to sketchy third party vendors with hidden fees.
Till now i didn't find a way to feedback to Skyscanner on uncompleted services so i can't review the services of their suppliers which is bad
"u are liar, i don't like this app. i booked hotel in yogyakarta Indonesia, and they are saying i didn't book. omg what's this? u are cheater. i need ur confirmation please answer and clear this"
The new font is not compatible with Vietnamese language. Words with accents display improperly.
I don't want to support a company that condones violence. Ask your parent company to make a public apology for supporting HK rioters or the one star will stay here forever.
