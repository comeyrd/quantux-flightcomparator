All the cheapest air fares from different agents under 1 roof that was awesome, i guess ignorance bliss i should have done a bit more research before purchasing my tickets from Tripsta which i did on 17th of May 2018 for a trip which i was travelling with my wife on the 22nd Aug 2018 from DXB to HRE, return flights on the 2nd Sept 2018 HRE to DXB . To cut a long story short we get to the check in desk of the airline and we told the tickets have been suspended by the agent Tripsta due to none payment this is an hour before boarding, I was shocked after hearing that i asked to see the supervisor, he said the same thing and he even took it a little further by asking us to come round the check in counter to show us on the system. We showed him all our emails from Tripsta and even a e'statement from the bank showing the online payment made plus the ticket sale receipt. I was advised to call the Tripsta toll free number which i did and it was fruitless it didn't even go through, I even had to call my Uncle in the wee hours of the morning based in UK to call the Tripsta toll free since its UK based agent and it didn't even go through to make it worse it gave us an alternative spanish number which didn't even go through. It was disheartening when We googled Tripsta and seeing all these bad review's about them, we had been planned for this 8 months in advance, so realising nothing could be done we ended up buying tickets from another agent at the airport which was expensive and we couldn't cancel our plans to go on holiday. We basically bought tickets twice and 1 set we didn't use due to we got scammed and used the other. So once we got back we tried contacting Tripsta asking for a refund and it was the same tune, no response from them.

Also, seeing the prices for the hole month was very helpful to help selecting the cheapest day to travel. I can't find that now!! I see no improvements, all the good stuff is gone and new stuff is just confusing. I have given a 2 star only because the idea of this app is very useful for me as far as flights are concerned. I don't understand why this app felt the need to add car hire and hotels. There are a lot of apps for that in the market and this app should focus more on what it is good at.  Thank you for your reply. I had already found the chart days but is not as easy as you describe. You have to select the days at the beginning of the search. Then search. Then select the days again and only then the chart icon will appear. It's confusing. Also you need to select the ""direct flights only"" option on every single search which is ver annoying. Lastly i feel that the generalised ""search by country"" (to check the cheapest airports in the contry) is not working properly and i had to check each departing airport to each destination airport which is very time consuming if those countries have 4 ou 5 airports each. This becomes an even bigger problem if you want to return by a diferente airport that might be cheaper.  Multy airport search is still a nightmare! Alerts have stop working properly. It now shows all flights including flights with stops and change in prices are shown for the cheapest flight even though they do not interest me. I would like to be able to add an alert for a specific flight at the time of my choosing otherwise this function is useless. Also if the app can remember your preferred settings for all searchers would be a massive improvement rather then changing it every time. Also i cant select the dates i want in multy search mode, it only shows me the cheapest dates for the next 3 months but if i want to fly in august i cant select any flights, so this is also useless.

If you can't make that date, you're stuck because you can't see any others without searching them all individually. How many people have a completely free choice of date within a month?

2017,5,"So I came to a frustrating plateau in my first time ever to shop for plane tickets and I possibly picked the worst season of the year to find ""affordable flights"" - Christmas! Nights of searching and planning how best to plan our flights, I found the prices jumped higher in price with every click of the search button. I tried a few websites such as Kayak and Travelocity and was so confused and frustrated by the lackluster of numbers, times, dates and compared costs on my 15"" laptop screen, that could barely hold in view the spew of information, until I found Skyscanner! This app has alleviated my first ticket buying experience from hair pulling to ""oh that was easy"". The interface is nice, they list out everything clearly and give hints as to what's a good deal or has a horribly long lay over. If you are new or seasoned alike at buying plane tickets I would recommend this app in your arsenal. To the developers - great job, my only real complaint is the filter ability and the way it organizes times. I found that some better times, for me personally, were lower in the list with a ""lesser"" rating but still way easier than any online site I used.",-0.770394504070282,-0.10154498368501663,1.1032294034957886

It got me Thai Airlines for less than $40 per person flying into BKK, which is great,  so now I can just take the airport rail link right into town and get to my Silom hotel quickly using the MRT and BTS, instead of flying me to the commuter airport DMK which I would have had to take a bus for half an hour just to get to the  MRT, to avoid the cab ride I had last time that cost $30 because the driver took the long way, over one hour,  in midtown after work traffic.

Skyscanner on a browser is fantastic and I absolutely love it, clear concise listings, great design, great search filters, great choices for results output, outstandingly useful TOP FIVE WEBSITE.  Then they let a toddler design the app, I wanty big pikuchures an punchy buttons wahhh, resulting (on a wide search) in stupid blocky pop results text cat-scratched onto pointless pictures that lack any information and blur the words you want to read, chronicly ill thought out formatting.  I have no idea at all why this crayon collage got past QC.  There is a reason roads are not an arrangement of randomly shaped and sized multicoloured frilly blocks with lamp posts made of jelly - adults like to see where they are going quickly and efficiently with all options re. traffic and alternative routes clearly marked.

After you exit it, the price still doesn't update (bug).  3. It would be nice to see price alerts that display price updates and include the filters you created e.g. if I want a max of 1 stop or a certain hour to fly out, it would be nice to be notified about price changes for those with my filters only, not for a flight with 2 stops being cheaper.

2016,1,"Searching used to have heaps of flexibility.

2016,1,"Been using Scanner App for a few years and now changing to something else. Too many prompts to log in, don't want to book holidays or cars only flights - clues in the title skyscanner!",,,
2016,2,The whole of month feature is why o used SkyScanner over other booking companies. You can still do it on the desktop app but it'd be good to see on mobile. I'm sure it used to be?!,,,
2016,4,"App is very nice and easy to use. Though i found one problem. When u select the destination then it will propose some dates automatically. But there is no way to select new dates. I have to select the proposed date and then on the next screen, i need to edit the change.",,,
2016,1,Used to love this app. They seem to have missed the ball. Used to be able to see monthly flights with the cost. Now? Where is it gone. Ah well it was good while it lasted.,,,
2016,1,"Very frustrated with he new version, can't compare prices on different days as easily, generic searches don't bring up cheap flights, you have to put multiple specific searches in, massive pain, no longer using.",,,
2016,1,Where can I manage Single / Return flights? Where can I manage the desired flight date? Sorry but the new update is a mess... :-( Why change it when the old one was easy and straight forward...?,,,
2016,1,Was a lot better when you could the  find. The cheapest flight by the month and not by date can you add this thanks for fast reply still like to see all price shown on graff table,,,
2016,1,I can't find flights easily. The old version of this app was more useful than the new version. I used to like the old one. Please check it and renew.,,,
2016,5,Much cleaner than the web-based version. Extremely pleased. Great job!! Sept 3 2016 update: I have used this app in so many corners of the world and still works great!,,,
2016,2,"The app stopped letting you search open dates, or specific dates at all. You MUST choose a specific set, like a week one or two weeks out. Pretty much makes it useless",,,
2016,2,Since the update the features I liked that no other app seemed to have have disappeared. Back to the browser or someone else's app for now. No longer special üòï,,,
2016,5,Gets best deals and with price alerts you can track prices up and down. Recommend to everyone I know. Love it and saves stacks of time.,,,
2016,1,Update is a disaster. Happily used Skyscanner for 2 years. Been struggling with update but giving up. Dreadful. Will look for an alternative app.,,,
2016,3,The old skyscanner apps seems much more focus on the flight search and the interface seems better especially the month view graph which used to be clearer and easy to identify cheaper fare.,,,
2016,1,Used to be a great app could see all prices for month ahead and book flights based on this.The old version was class. Seriously bring back the old App.,,,
2016,5,Thank you developers.. Appreciate it to the core and keep up this awesome app for travelers... it's our life saver,,,
2016,2,The updated app is difficult to use. Used to be much better. Easier to compare flights over a whole month and to select direct flights only.,,,
2016,4,Top Flight Deals show prices which cannot be found when one opens the list of flights. I'm still using it allways when planning a new trip.,,,
2016,1,This was a 5 star app with a perfect search function but this new update is clumsy and poorly thought out. Please bring back the previous version of this app.,,,
2016,1,"This app has become a real dog. I'm sure there is a way to select dates, but I can't find it. It used to be so intuitive.",,,
2016,1,New version is not very intuitive. Used to love the previous version. Also gives me constantly a connection error.,,,
2016,4,Good app or website to find cheap good flights. Organized and clean interface. Works for me.,,,
2016,5,"I think this GUI is better than the desktop version, especially as it remembers different trips to the same destination. Love the Happiness rating too üòä",,,
2016,5,The app. seems to be very user friendly & it does exactly 'what it says on the box'. The ability to sort by time of flight is also very useful.,,,
2016,1,Updates during last year have ruined the app. Slow and annoying. Switching to Kayak.,,,
2016,1,Has been gone and sincerely I don't understand why???? How can you destroy on purpose such a great tool. It's really sad!!!!!!.,,,
2016,4,Since desktops time I always used skyscanner to find cheapest flights. This apps make it lots easier now!,,,
2016,5,"Loved this app since I started using it!  As a student abroad I love the ""everywhere"" feature when looking for the cheapest flights!",,,
2016,1,You updated the app again and it's the same problem as last time. You can't change destination and search properly. Please fix,,,
2016,5,Great app. Give you every deal from all sites and including almost all of the airlines. Nice work,,,
2016,5,"Well, they fixed every single thing that I was disappointed that they had changed and they actually made it easier to read! Amazing! Skyscanner is #1 in my list again!",,,
2016,1,New update has ruined the usefulness and handiness of choosing a flight based on ones budget  rather than a specific date,,,
2016,5,Love this app. It's easy to use and the alert lets me get the flights I want at great prices,,,
2016,4,"Never used this app before, but missing the multi search flight option. Had a reply from the developers, they're working on it.",,,
2016,3,Before i could search from a destination to anywhere with any dates not anymore now i have to put dates in. I just want to see if there is any great deals i could take advantage of im not searching for somwthing in particular but now i cant just do that its crap compared to before,,,
2016,1,This new version has destroyed the app. What were they thinking putting out a half baked app!?,,,
2016,1,"This app used to be amazing why have they changed it, I will use something better now. Bring Back the old clean search with monthly search etc",,,
2017,1,Love the site but app has half its features. Can't do multi and single way???,,,
2016,5,"Thank you so much for providing such a useful tool, in such an easy to use and manageable interface.",,,
2016,5,"I have tried other similar apps and ended up uninstalling them. Now, I only use this application for   information on available flights and pricing.",,,
2016,4,Gives you great price ranges depending on your preferentes. Quick searches and constantly updated.,,,
2016,5,Easy to use. Much easier to find best prices from one site that searches best rates for you!,,,
2016,2,Disappointed that the option for bieng able to view monthly has gone. Was so much easier. Why ruin a good thing,,,
2016,1,"Why keep changing something what was good, you make it worse every time, you can't even search dates anymore !! What a pile of garbage",,,
2016,5,The new app is visually amazing and still very user friendly. Love using it!,,,
2016,5,I saved 400 dollars by finding a flight that my travel agent couldn't find using this app.,,,
2016,5,"Clean UI, offers lots of savings, and never crashes! I love this app.",,,
2016,5,Only missing multi trip price watch but works great for everything else,,,
2016,1,Latest update has ruined it. Dont think it shows some airlines as well,,,
2016,5,Full service covering all airlines that you find some really good deals with:),,,
2016,5,Love this app. Always gives me the best prices and so easy to use.,,,
2016,1,I dont like this app now! I prefer how it was before!! Thanks,,,
2016,4,Nice app that you get cheap flight rate information ...,,,
2016,4,"Forget the title,  i been using it for a while,  just felt like reviewing it now after seeing jen on twitter.   Cheers!",,,
2016,1,Bring back simple and clear version! Why make it complicated?,,,
2016,1,There was nothing wrong with the app so why change it? Please change it back to the old interface.,,,
2016,3,"Preferred the old design & focus on flights. The new app home page is annoying , should default to flights.",,,
2016,4,"App is good but v limited options, happy feeling but not great kinda... Not v much Indian but yeah v good",,,
2016,4,Useful and Cleer.  Be good if you could save personal settings and destinations and some kind of alert functionality would be great,,,
2016,5,Accurate and tight database of airports. Fast search. Great app!,,,
2016,4,Very good experience. Excellent prices with continuous tracking of the prices,,,
2016,5,Really good for finding the best options and prices! Good filters too,,,
2016,1,"no way to customize the time range, makes it completely useless, I'd rather go to the airline company to search one by one",,,
2016,4,This app doesnt have a feature to search multiple cities flight.,,,
2016,5,Great app. Very quick. The Currency selection option is very handy.,,,
2016,1,Things should improve...not getting worse...I cannot believe how bad it is now this app....Im unistalling it...that s how bad it is,,,
2016,1,"Used to be an excellent app, they should have left it alone. Please put it back how it was.",,,
2016,1,Hate the new interface. Before was much more useful,,,
2016,3,The app is giving a different rate from the main website. Its better to use the site using a laptop or desktop,,,
2016,1,Take an app that was quite good and make it terrible to use. Well done skyscanner,,,
2016,4,"I like this application so easily and have a very good follow up, till date I recommended it to my friends",,,
2016,4,"Great apps, easy to use, accurate price, but could be better by adding ""Multiple City"" in the apps as in the web.",,,
2016,1,Why is this once brilliant app so bloody hard to use now!? Rubbish!!,,,
2016,4,Giving it a 4 star because I want to be able to choose the cheapest months and do multicity search in the app,,,
2016,5,Simple and least disturbing. Tracks the flight costs well.,,,
2016,4,The app is great but it doesn't have the multi city option,,,
2016,4,Some similarities but a quick search option was not my first thought to choose,,,
2016,5,The app is very simple and it serves what I am looking for. Definitely will recommend this to my friends..,,,
2016,5,Great job. As a coca cola rep I fly alot on this app is well designed,,,
2016,4,"Best app , if only it could be predicting like kayak",,,
2016,4,Helps to find appropriate and suitable flight on one platform.,,,
2016,5,Woukd not use anything else. Recommended to all friends and family x,,,
2016,5,You made our life easy. It is simply amazing application.,,,
2016,5,"So easy to use, definitely the best flight search engine I've ever used",,,
2016,5,You can find everything yoy need from this app from the cheapest possible price as well!,,,
2016,5,I fly 2 times a week and this is the best app to let me know what flight to get.,,,
2016,5,The best part of this app is that it shows the prices for a whole month which helps you to plan your holiday if you are flexible,,,
2016,5,I buy tickets all over looking for good deals this app is the best by far,,,
2016,1,"How the #$&# do you find one way, no return flights.",,,
2016,5,Easy to use the price alerts are awsomeeee just love itttt,,,
2016,5,Can check & compare the fares very eaisly. Loved it,,,
2016,5,It is very easy to use and choose the best flights.,,,
2016,3,Please include multi city booking option in app too.,,,
2016,5,Love this app!! Great for economical world travelers,,,
2016,5,Absolutely amazing app. Shows what I need n how I need,,,
2016,5,"Perfeito para uma busca r√°pida por voos, e ainda com alertas sobre altera√ß√µes nos valores.",,,
2016,4,"I still use this app all the time, but it is now far less user friendly since the update. The ""explore top deals"" function with tile format is useless to me, the flight search function should be where that is. That said, the monthly price views for flights to a certain destination are still excellent.  I have saved a lot of money with Skyscanner. I hope developers are taking these comments on board and make a change. Multi city search like Kayak does would also be nice.",,,
2016,3,"New version extremely unintuitive. Also missing is the ability to select ""anytime"" which limits casual searching for flights. Entire month missing in parts. Also, on the widget I tapped the ¬£17 to Germany result and it searched for deals and returned 3. Cheapest was a ¬£23 return to Bremen leaving and returning the same day(!!!) and the others were over ¬£1200. No option to change any options post search. Useless. Still doesn't deserve the 1* reviews from the over reactionary crowd tho",,,
2016,1,"Primary features that made this service useful for planning random trips to anywhere have been removed. No more globe or ""united States to anywhere outside us"" filter to ensure I can skip all the continental flights. No more""all months"" filter either. This app went from indispensable to useless.  Edit: not even labels for what country the cities are in! You have to scroll around like a fool and do a google search. Go back to the column view and nested folder structure. No more gaudy tourist agency photos.",,,
2016,1,"This was a really useful app, very quick and intuitive to use with an easy to understand graphic representation of the flights available and their cost. What on earth happened. Bring back the original and call it the classic version as a separate app and very few will download this thing. Development is supposed to be about making things better. I really hate this text based, click here to find out a little more approach. Bring back the good working graphs they made it better than similar apps.",,,
2016,1,Skyscanner has always been quite a consistant trustworthy app but they dropped the ball with this last update. Many small things not working like they used to. Hopefully they fix it soon. Update 13th August...yes the one way everywhere flights have been completely ruined. My most used app feature üòï Don't fix what isn't broken App team. I'd pay to go back to the old graph version üòïüòïüòï,,,
2016,1,"Used to be so easy to search for flights but now they have made it so difficult and I can't even work out how you search for a single flight anymore. Looks like it's time for a change. Update 11th August 2016, yet again they have messed with the app and rendered it completely useless if you want to to search for flights. I do not understand the need to mess with the app and make it completely useless.",,,
2016,1,I used to love this app but it has been ruined. It's so messy and hard to use. Before I used to use the 'everywhere' feature and it would give me a list of the cheapest countries I could travel too. Now it comes up with random destinations in a tile format which is so hard to understand and dosent display what I want. I just want to know the cheapest country I can fly too. Please bring this back!,,,
2016,1,"Upgraded my mobile and downloaded this app as I've always used it to book flights before. For whatever reason the app is now completely changed with much of the previous functionality  (filtering departure and arrival times, airlines etc) has now gone leaving a bare app much the same as any travel app out there. Pity it's now useless to me and I'm deleting it :-(",,,
2016,1,"I liked the old version with graphs and a heck of a lot destinations in the everywhere option. It was quick and easy to look up cheapest destinations around the globe. Also the option to show cheapest flight dates was very good, I could plan my holiday around them. The essence of the app has been lost somewhat in the sense that people want it to find cheapest flights easily to any destination with any dates and have a browse at random flights to entice them to plan their next holiday as well.",,,
2016,2,There seems to be no correlation between the advertised price and the actual price... To be fair to skyscanner the mobile optimised site is still very good but it's very irritating to spend time searching flights only to find out the prices are not accurate. ..unlike the mos which is accurate and also still user friendly in terms of functionality...I don't think it should take much to retweak the app to sort these issues out...could be a PHP issue?,,,
2016,1,"I've never written any review but this is so bad I had to. New layout makes it impossible to select whole year to browse at leisure, results display make it hard to browse destination by country, then see detail by city, app keeps asking for location, all in all app has lost all interesting features that made it different from any other. I am terribly disappointed and see no purpose to this app anymore.",,,
2016,2,"Any way I can go back to an older version where there were graphs and I could look for one way flights to ""everywhere""? And also i used to be able to check which day would be the cheapest. There were so many ways to search for great deals. Now I'm just getting random results, it looks like. No idea how to use this app anymore. It worked super well last year. Now it doesn't even seem like the same app, any recommendations of which app I can use now?",,,
2016,1,"What was once the go to app for searching for flights is now almost unusable. I'm not sure how such an intuitive app has been ruined to this degree. I understand why you're trying to sell people the ""top deals"", but the app is now left lacking the charm it has previously. I'll probably try something else now.",,,
2016,3,"5 stars for the concept/service, 1 Star for the current app version. The whole top deals thing is really annoying and its hard to search for a simple flight now. I jump onto the website now or even get on bravofly or something because it's too annoying now",,,
2016,2,"I used to love the Skyscanner app. Now it's extremely frustrating to use. Trying to search flying from tehran to turkey, one way, and it automatically puts in a 7 day return date. New interface is messy and difficult to use.  The graphs were the best part of the skyscanner app. Very disappointed.",,,
2016,1,From what used to be my go to app to check for prices I now can't even get flights up with the horrible and needless new updates. Selected dates don't show any flights and there is no flexibility to finding flights within a set period or the app finding the cheapest prices in that set period of dates. Please undo the changes.,,,
2016,1,"Used to use this all the time for searching for flights. Since they updated it though, it's virtually useless. Can't search for one way flights, no more anytime anywhere search, and more other helpful stuff gone. Not happy! Needs fixing asap!!",,,
2016,1,Have you sent this out to a pilot group for review? Have you sent this out to your internal colleagues and requested feedback? This is disastrous and I'm quite sure you're going to lose an awful lot of business because of it. Revert back so I can enjoy a simplistic view to booking flights.,,,
2016,2,There should be a basic feature to filter airlines before search or save it in setting. The results shown without this feature can never be accurate. Because the low cost airlines may have cheaper airfare on one day whereas full service may have it on some other day. So the calendar then is of no use.,,,
2016,5,I initially became disillusioned very quickly and uninstalled it. Later I kept being referred to its website for tweaked options which did not exist in apps. Learned that I did not know how to tweak searches in this app. My bad. Landed 27% saving by adding 2 more hours of flight time with a younger higher quality airline. Saved me roadtrips with newer ideas and deals. Travel good. Learning it still. :),,,
2016,3,Skyscanner website when it first started used to be able to perform just a regular return fare check. It has now include a multi-city option which is very convenient for frequent traveler like me. Unfortunately the Skyscanner app still lacks this function. Zuji has it. Multi-city booking is increasing getting popular nowadays. Please consider having this function included in your next release.,,,
2016,1,Still can't search a whole month for the cheapest deal from a specific airport to everywhere. What's the point of the app if to search for cheap deals abroad you have to go onto the website. I want to be able to highlight the month of August like before not tediously go date by date airport by airport,,,
2016,1,"I used to love this app. The app is basically garbage now. For example, why must results show up as ""tiles"" now? I used to be able to quickly scan through different countries easily. Now when searching from an airport to ""everywhere"" why do I have to see every city in the US listed and then have to try and find a city in another country randomly interspersed in between?! If you insist on displaying results this way, at least sort the tiles by country so we can quickly select a country of interest.",,,
2016,1,"It used to be an excellemt app, but with each recent update the app functionality has been reduced. Not much flexibility in searching is left, and nothing functions properly. The screen space is all taken with ads. Shame. Time to migrate to a different travel app.",,,
2016,1,"I used to absolutely love this app but I just cannot stand the updated version. It's not as easy to use and I find most of the new features completely useless and unnecessary. If you haven't already, DO NOT UPDATE.",,,
2016,1,"Best deals? I just want to see flights I asked for, look for best dates and book. Was fine before, needed some update but not a whole change! Delete! Using holiday pirates one now",,,
2016,2,I can't search the period of time (one way) and the airport at the first page. I will have to click the recommended period of time then change the date and airport I want. It's a bit trouble. I prefer the old version.,,,
2016,3,The original version used to allow viewing of 1-3 months graphs showing price differences. Now you have to search each date separately. It would be a 5 star app if that option came back!,,,
2016,1,"Latest update is simply horrible. Doesn't give you as many options as before and it doesn't even work well on a mobile. Really hard to work with now, it was much before until some time ago.",,,
2016,1,"Desde las √∫ltimas actualizaciones es imposible buscar los vuelos como antes, ahora te salen solo ida y vuelta aunque no quieras la vuelta. Te tienes que ir a la p√°gina web para poder buscar de forma decente con el engorro que conlleva. Espero que lo arreglen y lo pongan como antes.",,,
2016,2,"New update makes it shoddy and hard to use. Don't download the latest version. Now too focused on 'top deals' we don't want to see that, hence why we're using what I would now refer to as Skyscammer.",,,
2016,3,"It doesnt remember the time filter for departure times or airlines filter when creating an alarm...i keep getting notifications for flights I know I cant/wont take. Also, on the website, it should allow me to get the visual monthly chart with my filters as well",,,
2016,1,"Yes I understand cards look pretty but I much preferred the old info dense list views that highlighted which countries I could get to in any date range than this. This no longer helps me find figure out ""where to next""",,,
2016,2,"I use to love this app, and recommended it to my friends, family members, and colleagues. Now, I despise it, because it use to be so much more efficient and user friendly. Please, app designers fix what you messed up!",,,
2016,1,"What on earth happened?  This used to be great and with every update it gets worse!! Turn the clocks back a year when it was worth having. Absolutely useless now unless you know exact dates,and even then its complicated at best!!!!",,,
2016,1,"I don't get why u guys changed it. One of the best feature u had was the ability to find the cheapest flight from a country to everywhere. U don't get the option of checking which month is   the cheapest to go no more, u have to check it month by month. I'm about to uninstall the app.",,,
2016,1,"Usually i don't rate apps but this time i have to do it. This is the worst update i have seen ever!! Old version was good, it was easy to search, please reroll update",,,
2016,2,"Clumsy interface, poor results being returned. Why did you have to change it? Tiled results are terrible. You have ruined this app and I like many others are really disappointed.",,,
2016,5,I use this app. I have just recently started flying between South Carolina and Seattle not business just leisurely visiting between my grandkids. This app helps me find the cheapest flights with the best service. Thank you to the creators of this app!!!,,,
2016,2,It was an amazing app before the update. I could search every where and anytime. I can find cheapest flight and make my plans accordingly. Please some how add those options back somehow. It was a great app and I recommended to every one.,,,
2016,1,"Used to rely heavily on skyscanner when booking flights, new version makes it pretty much much useless and non functional in my eyes. Previously recommended to everyone, will be quite the opposite going forward.",,,
2016,1,"Hate the new results, especially the Everywhere search results. Can't you just sort me by country and lower price and not show prices that were updated ""8 days ago"" ? PURE CRAP",,,
2016,1,"Why fix something that wasn't broken? It was a great app, i loved the search to ""everywhere"" to choose destinations. Now useless interface and disappointment :(((( Please return old functionality and interface!!!)))))",,,
2016,3,"Useful app but its changed alot and doesn't save the last search. After their major update, it's never been the same.",,,
2016,1,Searching for a one way flight to everywhere with entire month selected as the date is not possible anymore after update. This change has led me to search for another flight  booking app.,,,
2016,4,"Love this. Use it frequently for keeping check on prices for flights. Never had any technical issues, which is rare. üòÜ",,,
2016,2,Every time I pit to search flight it goes to top deals its so frustrating.. Can you guys put the graph back please .,,,
2016,4,OK so you can search for everywhere from the intro screen to find the best deals. A bit more cluttered than it used to be but still pretty good.,,,
2016,1,Used to be my go to app for searching for flights but the update has removed all the features that were great about it. Have downloaded Momondo and will be using that from now on.,,,
2016,5,"Love the way it saves my searches. For example, if I search for a ticket to Atlanta on 3 different sets of dates because I'm trying to find the cheapest dates, it saves all 3 of the date combinations. When I go back a few days later to look again, I don't have to put in all of the dates.",,,
2016,1,Hate this app now. Bring back the old one fast or you'll lose 80% of your customers.,,,
2016,5,A really good app that helps you look for cheap flights especially when you are looking for flights in advance. Notifies you when there is a cheap deal. Worth 5 stars. üëèüëè,,,
2016,1,Used to be all about functionality but now it's all about pictures and other non-sense this recent update has made me so angry to use an app in which I always used to travel nearly 33 countries.,,,
2016,1,"I haven't used SkyScanner for several months.. I don't know what you guys tried to accomplish with the new format, but it's a significant step backwards!",,,
2016,1,"Just make it like the website, we love the website. It's over complicated, where's the flexibile search, the cheapest month option? Why does the search come by city and not country?",,,
2016,4,Is it safe to book flights using this app? is the baggage allowance still the same? no hidden costs and additional charges compared when booking online with the airlines website? can anybody give me a feedback please?,,,
2016,4,Great app that is very easy to use. It would be perfect if it had functionality for planning multi-city flights.,,,
2016,2,"What have you done to this app!?! Extremely un-user friendly now, worked great before, will be deleting if not changed üôÅ",,,
2016,2,Used to consider this a 5 star app but recent updates have made this almost unusable. Please return to the old interface.,,,
2016,1,"One way doesn't always work, functionality lost, too advert looking, flexibility lost.  Bring back the old version",,,
2016,5,Look no other. Skyscanner is everything you need to save flight deals both local and international. Thank you Skyscanner!,,,
2016,1,Was way better before update. Am a travel professional and used the app daily. Now it will be deleted.,,,
2016,1,"Fix up, go back to old version, the tile view is useless, show me price by. Country",,,
2016,1,"This updated version is terrible. There is no way to search for a one way flight, it always defaults to a 7 day return flight regardless.",,,
2016,5,I love how user friendly the app is. It's absolutely the easiest way to book flights and find the best deals!,,,
2016,4,"with the last update its more difficult  for me to find best prices for future months, without a diagrama it was 1 month ago",,,
2016,5,Every time I want to fly I've used Skyscanner. Always the best deals and super easy to use!,,,
2016,1,no graphs.  hard to use. i'd rather check prices on individual airline websites,,,
2016,1,Doesn't allow me to select one way flights. Lags and is slow. Awful app.,,,
2016,5,Guys this app is actually the best app to book cheap flights. I tried alot of apps and this one is definetly the best.,,,
2016,1,Priceline lies about their prices they show you on thing and once your getting the deal the prices change completely,,,
2016,1,Why did you go and ruin a perfectly good app. Roll back to the previous version,,,
2016,1,"It cracks and freezes. The 1st version was nice, much better.",,,
2016,1,Can't I pay with my master card on this site? Because  I am afraid i don't want to be fraud.,,,
2016,1,Getting worse after update i cant find option to select one way flight.,,,
2016,1,Any way to go back to old version this update ruined a good app,,,
2016,1,"Going to find a different app now, the functionality that made it great has been removed for the sake of selling package deals",,,
2016,5,Lets me find flights and hotels easily on my mobile.,,,
2016,1,Unfortunately the feature SELECT ALL MONTH disappeared when you set up an itinerary between two cities.,,,
2016,5,App works great and can find the cheapest flight easily..,,,
2016,1,Awful update. Please bring back the classic version.,,,
2016,1,Latest update is  sucks. I cant filter by date easily,,,
2016,3,I hope you place a flight comparison chart for each month so I'd easily know when to go,,,
2018,2,"So bad you  can't search by open dates, something that I really liked about this app",,,
2016,4,It's a great app but compared to the web version the multiple cities option is missing.,,,
2016,4,"Please try to make it more simple, easy and add multi city options for flight booking",,,
2016,1,"Every search is Top deals, totally ignored my criteria",,,
2016,4,Simple and quick comparing of flights and easy to book tickets.,,,
2016,2,Much more difficult and confusing to use since it has changed.Uninstalling,,,
2016,5,Give a lot information for the updated ticket price,,,
2016,5,Good ap. I like putting in a destination an being notified about pricing,,,
2016,5,When I'm bored my plan is visit this app and finding out my where is going to be my next trip,,,
2016,5,"Best flight search app, includes more airlines than others",,,
2016,5,"Very good app and time saving, can be used for flight comparison",,,
2016,5,"Basically a meta search of all booking sites, all in one.",,,
2016,5,awesome loved it jus make alarm for selected date reminder,,,
2016,5,Easiest way to puzzle a cheap flight that matches your needs,,,
2016,5,5* and recommend this app to others for flight bookings,,,
2016,1,"You have NOW ruined the app in its entirety, at least on the android version. It is simply worthless. You added the ""everywhere"" option again, great! But trying to find a ONE WAY flight to another country takes centuries as now I have to go thru dozens and dozens of city names with pics until I see something interesting from a different country. Those times of trying to find a cheap ticket to an another country as an adventure, are long gone. Today, is my last day of using this app. After 5 long years.",,,
2016,1,"The latest version has removed or changed some of the best features that this app had. I've been using it for at least 2 years now, and recommended it to lots of people, but after this update I don't think I will be using or recommending it anymore. Gotta start searching for a new one I guess. Really a shame.",,,
2016,1,"This app was originally successful due to its simplicity and quick functionality. Now, with all the stock photos and clutter, it is just another travel/brochure app. I know where I want to go, I don't need to see pictures. I just need quick lists of my options. Oh dear. I will have to find another app. Perhaps I'll try Kayak or whatever. Angry.",,,
2016,1,"I just want to search a cheap flight from point A to point B (point B being anywhere), one way. The app always searches for return flights for random amount of days, and a different month to what I'm searching for. The app was fine about 2 years ago. Fair enough keep updating it, but it's just getting worse and worse and worse. It's just...really, really bad. Sorry.",,,
2016,1,"Why remove functionality?  It appears to no longer be possible to search flights from a specific location to Everywhere on a specific date. Instead I get ""Top Deals"" for a whole month, and not the month I searched on.  You just can't stop fidling with yourselves can you. Looking for a better alternative now, this app has had its day.",,,
2016,1,I use to enjoy using this app to look for flights. If I pick where I want to go and the dates I want do give me your BS package deals that I'm not looking for it I would have searched for them. If it's not broke don't fix it. I think to many developers think they need to tinker and change things to often.,,,
2016,1,"Why change something that was working really well? The latest update is too busy, not very clear or easy to follow! Dates keep flicking back and cities reverting after I change them! All I want is to be able to input a destination and dates!  I've booked pretty much every flight by going through this app in the past and now I'm actually searching the playstore for an alternative!",,,
2016,1,This used to be my favourite app. Pick a destination and look across a whole year for the best deals and then book. Now it's like all the other crap travel apps that force you to enter when you want to travel. Why break something that work's! So disappointing!,,,
2016,1,"Before this update this app was amazing, right now instead it sucks a lot. I used skyscanner for looking for flights, not for hotels or car rentals. After the update the app is awful: you have time till next summer to fix it back or you ll loose me for sure.",,,
2016,1,"The chart and the everywhere option is gone! You cannot even choose a country destination, only cities. For what reason to use this app and not any other from the dozens out there?!?! Total disaster!    EDIT: Latest update still problematic, no ""anytime"" option and ""everywhere"" option just brings up with random useless ""deals"", nowhere near the functionality of the initial versions... Uninstall and wait for a new update.",,,
2016,2,This used to be my favourite app for just seeing where I could go cheap and when. So many holidays planned around cheap flights thanks to this app. But then they ruined it. Bring back the simplicity and allow to see a list of flights to everywhere at any time so I can start planning again,,,
2016,3,"Some good ideas, but obvious things are missing. For example - give me updates only on destinations outside the US, or only in South America, or only in SE Asia. Allow more flexible date ranges. Have a direct feedback to the developers, as opposed to having to give a review shortly before uninstalling the app.",,,
2016,2,"This used to be a wonderful app, I could search for flights to a specific region or country and didn't have to enter dates. Now, I have to scroll through a long list of cities to try and find any fare deals. It's really disappointing",,,
2016,3,"Updated: they did add back the ""everywhere"" search option, but when they pull up the results it's like Google flights... which I don't find to be useful at all. The list I feel was easier to navigate. I guess this looks prettier, but the list was more useful in my opinion",,,
2016,1,Please return to old version.  This one is the worst app now. Going from best to worst took some doing but you have managed it. Deleted app from phone on till fixed. Would recommend everyone to do the same.,,,
2016,5,Been into serious travel excess 40 years as mega indipendant globetrotter.  The more research i can do the better. Sky scanner provides much needed & vital travel info in my ever expanding online must have library. Would not leave home without it. Gets my vote every time. Do yourself a mega favour & get it asap.,,,
2016,1,I cant use this after an update.  Its a horrible unintuitive mess.  Trying to look up flight for two and an infant and i cant find anywhere how to change the options like before.  Probably has it but i cant be bothered to read the code just to do it,,,
2016,1,"How you manage to single-handedly destroy a perfectly good app in one update is beyond me. This is a strange, cluttered, unintuitive mess. It took me a good 5 minutes to find a one way search option. So bad.",,,
2016,1,The app is very similar to many of the other flight apps.  It was unique and excellent before the update.  Backpackers loved it now not so much.  Now the one-ways and anywhere searches are difficult,,,
2016,2,Before the recent updates I could search flights during an entire month. Now I need to search on specific dates which is really inconvenient. In addition to that the overview is very chaotic and somewhat unclear. I hope they bring the month-search function back.,,,
2016,1,"Bring back the old app I used it everyday. This updated vision is terrible very poor searching for flights everywhere!! used to bring where flights go, prices now is deals on certain dates rubbish",,,
2016,1,"Search without date and pick the cheapest flights, via nice graph gone...what made you different from others is gone. Usability got much worse in many aspects.",,,
2016,1,"I did repeated searches for a flight next year... prices suddenly rose by 50%. Booked on laptop at the lower, original price, later that day. Dodgy!",,,
2016,1,"I'm sorry to say, I hate the changes you've made. Skyscanner used to be how I planned all my vacations but ever since you removed the ""Anytime"" option and made it so we have to scroll through all US destinations city-by-city before getting to anything international, this app has become pretty much worthless to me.",,,
2016,1,Arrrggh I hate the new updates. Please do us all a favor and bring back the old Skyscanner. You've destroyed a perfectly good app when you did this update.,,,
2016,5,I use this app all the time and it's the best out there. Don't waste your time with those dumb features. This app finds you the best flights at the lowest rate in half the time period.,,,
2016,3,"Before it was simple to search for a one way flight at some point in the future, now whenever I search a flight I end up with return results. The search flow is also much more confusing :(",,,
2016,1,I loved it first but after new update it's useless! Loved the first version nice and easy to use and very clear. This one gives me a headache,,,
2016,4,Although i loved the previous versions of the app. I welcome the new changes to the app too. But please bring the nearby airport and add multicity options to flights search.,,,
2016,1,Why can't I search and see a bar graph for chepeast flights any longer?! Absolutely destroyed my favourite app with this latest update.,,,
2016,1,As other users have said. What the hell did you do that for? Yes the pictures look okay but user experience is most important. Please change back to the version we all loved..,,,
2016,1,"This app looks like it was done by a 9 year old. Why make these changes. Totally ruined a great app , to find flights.",,,
2016,1,"Since I've updated this app, my phone just freezes and I have to take the battery out in order to start using it again! !! I'm uninstaling it hoping that you will solve the problem.",,,
2016,5,Best app to find cheap flight tickets. Graph shows low fare days and months. Loved it..üëå‚úåüëç,,,
2016,1,"There's an old saying in the UK, ""if it's not broke don't fix it"". Quite simply you have ruined a very good app. I'm having to search through the main desktop site as this is a jumbled mess.",,,
2016,1,Used to be an excellent app to find cheap flights. Now it's worthless. Worse now than any other flight app. Too bad.,,,
2016,5,Good apps for traveller. But personally I prefer previous version. Cause you may just key in everywhere and the apps will find the flight to the whole world .,,,
2016,5,I've used this app fifteen times over the last two years. Always my go to for the best price. Guaranteed!,,,
2016,5,"Was once a great app... Now it's quite useless on this config. No excuses about ART etc pls, I'm sure it's some simple fix from the app's part even if it might be considered a ""workaround"". Why am I saying this? Other apps (some are a hundred times more complex) are running fine. ART isn't disappointing me otherwise.",,,
2016,5,"Great app, really helpful,  love how easy is to get around and find the best flights at the best prices!!! Amazing job... keep it up :)",,,
2016,5,"I like the new logo. Simple and minimal. Reminds me of SoundCloud a bit. Anyway, I like the app. Gets me better deals everytime",,,
2016,1,"Previous version much easier to navigate. I don't need images, bring back the lists. Not good SS!!",,,
2016,1,"Changed it again!!  It was great,  then updated and was bad.  Then it was good again but now another horrible update.",,,
2016,1,I don't know what the developers were thinking but as you you surely already know you've removed the best features with the update. Don't be surprised when stats move negatively.,,,
2016,1,This used to be the best app for finding cheap flights. Where can you check for the cheapest flight? Now using CheapFilghts.,,,
2016,4,Its really amazing app.. I frequently checks the flights n rate.. The cheapest one I got it from it.,,,
2016,2,"I love the older version, I am not able search for one way flight with this updated version. Can it be fixed?",,,
2016,4,I loved it ....as it covers not only airline websites but also third party ticketing websites as well in one click.....before this app I was having hard time swinging between different websites for price quotes but here everything is displayed in one platform.....kudos,,,
2016,1,After update  i can't find anything. Please bring back the old search. Still useless  after 1.8.2016 update.,,,
2016,5,Amazing app for flight bookings... seriously loved it ! Cheapest prices compare to all webites n travel agencies,,,
2016,2,New update is bad - used to have a clear list of flights; now an awkward list of 'squares' with pictures - not intuitive.,,,
2016,1,Please being back list View and fix that Bug that prevents you from searching for whole month. And fire the person in charge for the design. U made it worse!!!!!!,,,
2016,1,It was a much simpler and easier to use now  it is just useless. On android can't seem to be able to see one way deals,,,
2016,5,An amazing app. Just need to book 28days before... to get good price. Keep improving...,,,
2016,5,"I really like this app.  Option to ""anywhere"" is the best thing ever on travel apps.  Kudos.",,,
2016,1,"After using sky scanner for ten years and being a huge advocate for it the new app is so terrible that I was left totally frustrated. Sad, sad day, goodbye sky scanner.",,,
2016,1,Latest version doesn't seem to allow for a search of a full year at once. Back to the website I guess..,,,
2016,5,I like the email alerts when the price decreases . App definitely works in your favorite when you're trying to get best deals,,,
2016,5,"Great app for looking at flights,  loads of info that seem unbeatable.  Easy to use,  love it",,,
2016,1,this upgrade when i serch for flights keeps switching to deals    ended up using the old version still on my tablet,,,
2016,4,"Great, but as a Scottish company I'm sure you could see the benefit of being able to split 'UK' into its constituents, would be a much appreciated feature, and I'm guessing not a difficult one to add",,,
2016,3,"Guys please, u add a lot of functions, but the main one whe you see calendar with dates in red yellow and green colors to find cheaper date are gone please add it back, hope for response, like this program",,,
2016,2,"Why can't I search for flights within the month / year? And why can't I sort destinations (when using ""Everywhere"" as a destination) by price (ascending)?",,,
2016,5,"New UI is absolutely a treat to use . Very clean interface, crystal clear flight details and great to use",,,
2016,1,Too difficult to navigate and find the best flights. The old version or website are much better.,,,
2016,1,"I have it one star to steer people away. The more people know about it, the quicker the deals will end",,,
2016,5,This is really good to find all flights with cheapest rate.. and its so simple to use..,,,
2016,5,Simply compare the market for flights. Excellent. Nice design to.,,,
2016,5,Great app. So useful especially the price alert üëç. Highly recommended.,,,
2016,1,Before new design it was the best. Now it looks horrible. Please go back to old design.,,,
2016,1,What happened Skyscanner? I really hope you guys fix this horrible update soon!!,,,
2016,5,"If you are planning a trip and you want the best deal, this app does all of the work for you.",,,
2016,1,Goodbye SkyScanner. Thanks for ruining a once wonderful app.,,,
2016,1,Only one destination makes this app not usable. Please allow multi city as per website,,,
2016,1,The first time it was easy to use but after remembering my preferences it's impossible to find new serch.,,,
2016,2,After the latest update it is just a terrible app. I want the previous version back!!!,,,
2016,2,It's still not better coz as travelling we always search different airport but still in we can't change the departure airport so it's really suck,,,
2016,1,Please please go back to previous app. Recent update is in no way an improvement.,,,
2016,1,Ruined best search app out there ..quite  simple..go back to old version..if it isn't broke don't fix it..,,,
2016,5,Love the UI. It is easy to search and the price alerts are exactly what I was looking for.,,,
2016,5,This app it's a great tool that help me travel with a tight budget.,,,
2016,1,Use to love using this app. Upgrade just doesn't search for what I ask it to.,,,
2016,4,"I book most of my tickets via skyscanner !....Amazing fares ,great app ! A must have for eaCh phone",,,
2016,4,I'm rating 4 stars on the quality of the pervious version. The latest version doesn't seem to work at all on my S7,,,
2016,4,"Good app , getting rates from max. Sites online so getting the cheapest fligts",,,
2016,1,You could not of done a worse job updating your app it was so great before now it is totally useless,,,
2016,5,My 1st Stop for flights and loving the layout of the new version,,,
2016,4,Is OK but I remember it used to be easier to compare different prices in different dates with a graf they used to have,,,
2016,3,Good app but it should show calender fare that would be more useful.,,,
2016,5,Use it often then Google flights then final bookings.,,,
2016,4,"Not quite sure yet but give it time, I just downloaded it üòä",,,
2016,4,"Can't seem to search for full month anymore, otherwise good",,,
2016,4,It gives quick results and tells me what is the best price,,,
2016,3,Can't seem to search for multiple city? I'll stick to the site.,,,
2016,5,"The UK to everywhere search is simply my favourite, so many options!",,,
2016,5,It would be great to have an ability to reorder watched flights and see the weekdays of dates.,,,
2016,5,"Design is simple,but It has every useful function,information.",,,
2016,5,Very easy to use app that displays the most convenient options for any need,,,
2016,5,I have taste many app travel and this is the best one.,,,
2016,5,Really easy to use and a great way to find cheap flights,,,
2016,5,Simple and intuitive access to relevant information.,,,

2016,5,I have been using this app from long and it's been my favorite always,,,
2016,1,"App is great but recently a company has appeared offering really low prices on searches, which are nowhere to be seen when trying to buy. 'Air express' they call themselves now but they have several names. Needs looking into :)",,,
2016,1,The new update make it impossible to find the best prices and destinations,,,
2016,5,Best app for booking flights. One of the best comparisons!,,,
2016,1,"This was one of mine favorite apps ever...till the last update. It is confusing, terible navigation and not user friendly. It will be uninstaled if something is not changed. Lot of previous features are now unavailable, like searching flights everywhere. Maybe it is there but you simply can't find it. Terible, terible update. You made one hell of a app totaly useless and complicated.",,,
2016,1,"I used to love the charts and everywhere feature - now it only shows me set dates and obscure European cities. I've booked many flights through this app but now the search is useless!                                     EDIT - thanks for your reply Skyscanner, but my problem is that the ""everywhere"" feature doesn't show everywhere anymore - it doesn't even feature most countries anymore. Also I still can't find the chart feature even when looking for it, the calendar option has no visible chart button.",,,
2016,1,"This app used to be unique and allowed for flexibility.  The update has made this app worse.  I loved the Everywhere option but it is only on Top Deals now.  The top deals option is useless as it is filled with deals to US - I would rather skip over US as a whole.  Navigation is also difficult since the update, and it basically does what any other flight/hotel searching app out there does - it is nothing special anymore.  I'll wait for next update, if the old features aren't restored, I'll have to delete.",,,
2016,1,"Now cannot search for one way flights (which is vital for someone on a round the world trip) and the ""everywhere"" search is now far less functional. The ""top deals"" search is all that remains, and it clunky and hard to use. Edit: When I open the app from my home screen, the quick search option is not present on the initial page but when I open the webpage via a Google search, the app that opens has a quick search function. Not sure how it could be that two versions of the app seem to be running on my phone.",,,
2016,1,"The new update has turned Skyscanner into just another travel app.  The keystone feature: the option to see a list of cheapest flights from a given airport sorted by destination country, has been removed in favour of a difficult to navigate splash-screen of so-called ""top deals"". Skyscanner has scored me some awesome flight deals in the past, but the way it's set up now, I would never have been able to access them.",,,
2016,1,"I used to recommend this app to everyone. The latest update has taken away the best and unique features. Because of my location I am flexible with the airports I travel from, with the new update I cannot  select flights from my whole country meaning I now have to run a number of searches. Also the search for flights ""everywhere"" now seems hidden and reduced. Also as it is now not sorted by country it also means you have a lot more go sieve through. I will stop using this app if it does not improve",,,
2016,1,"UPDATE: app completely overdeveloped!  The images are pretty, smh but take to long to load and kill mobile functionality. Bless those who pay for data-this is not the app for you.  Two of the ways I could tweak one way searches are gone! The solid share of 'traveler' market is sacrificed to another tourist app.  Boooo skyscannerüò¢ why?---(old)  This used to be my goto on the road, in a pinch, small drag on data, sweet, smooth ui. Not anymore...Better was the enemy of good enough. recommend ita matrix app.",,,
2016,2,"The features of being able to pick everywhere or to everywhere else, or to be able to pick the whole country rather than cities etc are gone. Its like the intentionally wanted to screw their app. Please bring the features back. The older interface was more intuitive. They were the prime things why we had this app on our phone. I'd give a better rating only if I can have them back.",,,
2016,1,"Can i buy the source code for the older version because seriously this app sucks now. You guys got rid of the filters and many features in the new design. Big mistake, your just inviting competition now, id hate to see you guys dissappear expecially because ive booked 2 flights with your app previously. Look CEO to CEO, just re-release this build as SS2 (Skyscanner 2) and roll back the old version. Its worse than I thought. Were going to need a public apology these reviews are tragic.",,,
2016,1,"Loved this app and used it to find and book flights. Now it doesn't have any of the features for which I had loved it. Here's what I want: I'm in Europe and I want to travel in the next 6 months. Don't know where, don't know when. I want to say I'm leaving from airport X. Where is the cheapest to fly? When is the best time? New update won't even tell me which destinations are available from my chosen airport. Please go back, or at least add the options back.",,,
2016,2,"This new update made app totaly useless. Not possible to search flights from destination to everywhere sorted by countries, compared by lowest price. Not possible to compare one way flights, instead of this great features app show totaly unreasonable offers of any unsorted flights to destinations. App lost its functionality, now it is only one of another unusable flights search app with no reason to be installed on my phone. PLEASE GIVE US BACK OLD GOOD SKYSCANNER",,,
2016,1,"The latest changes have made the app unusable for anyone who just fancies seeing what the prices are worldwide from a particular airport/country in a particular month. The ""everywhere"" option is present in Top Deals but with significantly reduced functionality where it only shows prices for a particular date of its choosing rather than allowing the user to browse all prices for that route. Unless you are using the app to search for a specific flight on a specific date, it is basically useless.",,,
2016,1,"Used to love this app. I'm travelling and it's been great for finding locations to go to next. The new interface is more complex, has got rid of the 'everywhere' option and it just seems like a massive step backwards. I've been using skyscanner for over 12 years, and it was the 'everywhere' option that kept me coming back, but I'll be looking for alternatives now.",,,
2016,1,"The perk of this app was to be able to launch broad searches for flights in terms of destinations and date range (e.g.: Montreal to Everywhere; August 2016) and look at all the possibilities.   Now,  it's just like any other travel app.  You are restricted to a very precise search.  It used to be so useful. Uninstalling it.",,,
2016,1,"This update has ruined what was by far the best part of the app - everywhere search. Now you have to go through skyscanner's recommended deals, which is just filled with close locations and is not grouped by country (and it seems you can't do everywhere search for one way flights?). Add everywhere search back to the normal flight search -&gt; group by country -&gt; then group by airport. For now I am uninstalling the app and I'm amazed at how shortsighted the recent updates have been",,,
2016,1,"This used to be my favourite travel app. Pick a departure airport, select destination everywhere, see what came up, scroll the calender for suitable dates, boom. That feature has now gone and it's now a convoluted mess with the changes made not adding value. Real shame.",,,
2016,1,"Skyscanner, take on board what others are saying! The app is now unusable. Can't search one-way flights or search for flights going ""everywhere"". If you're saying this IS possible, then let me (and several hundred others) make this absolutely crystal clear for you; your app is no longer intuitive. Stop arguing the point and amend ASAP.",,,
2016,2,"For the love of God the new layout is worthless. I'm sick of having to press the back and next buttons a thousand times to change one little thing.  Skyscanner is already for smart travelers. We are exploring a hundred options at once. I used to be able to do that. I have to use the website now because the app is for grandparents and people who can barely use orbitz.       Update..... What happened to the ""everywhere"" option in the destination? That was literally the only thing you had better than kayak",,,
2016,1,"This used to be the best app.... Now gone. The update is a disaster. What's bugging me is that you give the same answer to everyone. Just admit it is a wrong update and make a statement about it. Not just say the same useless phrase. And you say that the one-way search is to be found in the chart interface, on a circle? Which circle? There is no circle. You ruined all those country to country searches. App gone really bad!",,,
2016,1,"Can't search from the UK any more, has to be a specific airport. Also the monthly searches aren't there where it lists the flight costs for every month. The new way of searching also only offers up to 5-7 day trips. What if I want to go for longer? Please please restore to how it used to be",,,
2016,1,"I don't need or want your deals for cheap trips. There are a hundred other apps that do that. Your app WAS great because it gave me freedom of choice in picking a cheap destination and then the cheapest days. If I lose this, I will probably not use this app anymore, which is unfortunate because that will severely affect my travel abilities. Give me back the Everywhere option and the bar graph to pick cheap dates. And that ""Everywhere"" function in the deals is not the same. Don't pretend it is.",,,
2016,1,"Dear developers team, I have been using this awesome app for many years. But now its almost impossible to find cheap tickets --- where is the month search and how to choose a country instead of city or airport? --- Where is the ability to search tickets for ""everywhere"" destination? You are the best, guys, please bring listed features back!",,,
2016,1,"Where is the good old monthly prices overview gone?? Awful new navigation and suddenly bad overview of good deals for trips longer than 1 week üò° will wait for next update but if it doesnt improve must delete it. Shame, was my favorite flight engine before update which ruined it..",,,
2016,2,"Once we set the price alerts, this app gives proper timely alerts on changes in price if any.. Problem is when there is low price change alerts then we immediately go and do the search.. Buy no flights are shown at that low price.. It shows with high prices only.. Then not sure why do we set alerts if this is the behaviour.",,,
2016,1,"This app used to be great, but the latest update has completely killed it. Firstly, the search ""Everywhere"" option  has vanished. Secondly, you now have flights, hotels and car hire...how about you get the flights sorted first and then worry about the rest? Thirdly, it's now a cluttered mess. Get in the bin",,,
2016,1,"I just find it useless, in the previous version  you were able to see the average price per month, so it was easy to book a date...now you have to choose an specific date...and algo the interface is not friendly. I have read many other reviews and the support replays, and the problem is the same...and the same answer, but the point is that is not a nice app anymore",,,
2016,2,"I used to love this app because it was so flexible, you could see where was cheapest to fly to from any UK airport. The latest update forces you to select outgoing and destination cities. Skyscanner was unique because it allowed really open searches, please change it back to the way it was!!",,,
2016,3,"Following Skyscanner's reply;  Yes there is some similar functionality but the new app has lost the intuitive interface from the earlier version, or indeed the current website version. Skyscanner needs to read the comments preceding mine! Install the previous interface quickly!!",,,
2016,1,"Had this on my old phone and seem to remember it was great.  Thought I could easily add filters for nearby airports, both departure and arrival, move a little slider for departure and arrival times, and, choose direct or 1 stop etc. It was hugely customisable but I can't even use it now for anything other than a simple search.",,,
2016,1,Why the changes?!? What made this app great was the ability to not have to enter specific locations. I am a very flexible traveller and loved the ability to enter just a country to fly out of and look for the cheapest places to go next. I do not want to have to enter a specific city. Please add this option back!,,,
2016,1,"What an absolute mess you've made of my favourite app. Too much hard work now,, i'll be looking elsewhere. For quick search you can't get all flights from UK. I still haven't  worked out how to search one way flights either.",,,
2016,1,"I preferred the old version so much clear and better so I uninstalled this version and use the old one.  Every new version worst...  Can believe it.  So difficult to use by searching ""whole month""  like before.  As usual.  I uninstall new version and stay I  the old one...",,,
2016,1,"it was great last week but then you changed it and rather than improving it its now less useful - the best thing about it, and what  made it unique, was the ability to do wide ranging searches like searching flights by country now its way more time consuming to go  airport by airport and makes it just like all the others. its a shame you don't appear to be taking any notice of the many reviews that preferred it the way it was and would have probably raved about it and recommended it to friends",,,
2016,1,"Can't select a country as a whole anymore in 'departure' whilst searching for flights, nor can you select 'everywhere' anymore or have one month selected as your preferred departure time with another month selected as your preferred time to come back. Basically, it's incredibly unusable and has lost its user friendliness.",,,
2016,1,The app says reflects all taxes and fees till you go to book your flight and bam more hidden fees very disappointed. The new face lift has ruin this app if it's not broke don't mess with it such a pity.,,,
2016,1,"Big dislike since the last update. Before I used Skyscanner a lot. Now it's not possible to find the best prices within short time, everything has become more complicated. I will delete it, it's not useful anymore.",,,
2016,1,I told you several months ago you had ruined a perfect app now it has got even worse!!  Where has the everywhere UK to anywhere  in the world functionality gone?? Some of us like a random trip so compare prices to multiple destinations,,,
2016,1,This service no longer gives updated information on flights. Every time you think you've found a deal it no longer exists. Often the data is about 1 day old. I'm moving back to Kayak. At least they give you honest prices.,,,
2016,1,I've been using Sky scanner more than 5yrs now. And now I'm thinking to find another app. Cause new update version sucks!!! Very very disappointed almost heart breaking. This turns absolutely hopeless and useless.,,,
2016,5,"It remembers my filters and it has  price alert notification. It also has  lowest price estimate per  month, which is easy to notice because it is color coded. With over 10 million downloads for this app, one can never go wrong. One should look no more. This app is very, very good!",,,
2016,1,Dislike very much the updated app.. The previous one was much better easier and clearer to use                          i read no-one likes the updated app...Just go back to the previous version.. Which was far easier and better!,,,
2016,1,The good old days of searching every country in the world for a flight any time of the year are apparently gone. As it stands there's absolutely no reason not to use the mobile website insead.  This update better be reverted soon.,,,
2016,2,The new update has made me less likely to use the app. In the past I have recommended Skyscanner because I could see the average prices per month and the different prices per day. That is no longer a part of the app I have loved. I am uninstalling.,,,
2016,1,"Latest update is rubbish!! Data is not displayed very clearly and I cannot search single tickets from my airport to everywhere! This app was one of my favourites for years, but I now find it very disappointing...  Please do something!!",,,
2016,1,It's now impossible to search for the best flights. Unable to search for everywhere flights. Keeps coming up with tragic recommendations which you have no way of knowing if the best deal. Total crap! Need to find an alternative. Where is the everywhere function??????,,,
2016,2,I used to love skyscanner app. Fan completely devoted to it but guys what you did with the last update? It's just terrible. I hope it's just for me or you are going to lose a lot of fans.,,,
2016,1,Web site design is good.  But android  app not much.. Please update like Web application as same to Android..  With multiple city's searching options. Thanks,,,
2016,1,This new update is really not a good decision. This apps is not user friendly anymore and I can't find features to choose cheapest month after the latest update. I really love to use the old one more than this latest update. Hopefully you can consider to get the old one back.,,,
2016,4,"Couldn't find deals for larger duration... Also top deals are given for  journey in the same month, which is not much useful. I would like to plan journey as per the travel budget, no such options found.",,,
2016,1,"What have you done to this app. Honestly used to be a must have app. Now it's impossible to use, buggy, confusing, and misleading with prices, such a shame. Go back to your basics guys.",,,
2016,1,"Can only search to ""everywhere"" in ""Explore top deals"" no longer able to do so in flight section. Being able to search for a flight to everywhere/anywhere is the main reason I use skyscanner. Please fix ASAP!",,,
2016,2,I've opted for the desktop version and Google flights. I really tried with the app update! But time is everything as I am traveling. I find myself scrolling through a lot of info that is irrelevant to me before I find what I need.,,,
2016,2,It used to be great but the latest update is just bad. I want to put LAX and it does not even.show up. I tried typing Los Angeles and it's not there. Are you kidding?,,,
2016,2,With the newest version I can't search ' anywhere'  and also there is more changes done to worse...  I Miss the old good simple  versions.  This is BS.  I'm looking for a new app.  Bye bye Skyscanner,,,
2016,1,....but felt the need here... what have you done to the app? Generic simple open search by either country/ city/ one way / round trip/ flexible date range is the idea of using a flight scanner...now your just ryanair in a different colour... change it back please,,,
2016,1,"This app used to be the best, now it is impossible to use even for just basic stuff. The user interface is so complicated to use now... Just bring back the old version.",,,
2016,1,The best thing about this app was that I could just select my airport and it would show me the cheapest flights to anywhere in the world. That was how I planned my vacations. Its gone now. Want the old version back.,,,
2016,1,The new update turned Skyscanner to useless app.  It lost the main features for County search all over the mo ths to get cheapest month.  I will uninstall it if no update to recover that feature,,,
2016,3,"The app sucks now, cos ya catered to all the stupid people of the world by douching up the interface. Thanks for the desktop version though, it's a work of art and I use it all the time.",,,
2016,5,The app makes the life of heavy traveler like me much easier. It helps me to find always the best offer for flight. The interface of the app is also cute and user friendly... love it!,,,
2016,1,I used to use this for easy and quick way to search for flights but the new update makes it frustrating and impossible to use. A once awesome app turned awful. Its disappointing,,,
2016,1,It's completely different and unusable. I can't even search flights to / from whole countries to find the cheapest flight or search for the whole month. I'll stop using it now.,,,
2016,1,It makes me pick a place to see the best deals. Makes it impossible. I can't look for flights on my phone anymore. Older version was great!,,,
2016,1,"Strongly dislike the last update. Have no idea why you guys removed travel to ""anywhere"" it was so flexible and useful. Turn it back please!",,,
2016,2,The latest update has removed the best feature - non specific search. We used sky scanner all the time to find the cheapest flights to anywhere. Please put this back!,,,
2016,1,"I've no idea what skyscanner were thinking, the latest update has ruined the clean intuitive UI of the previous edition. Can no longer search for flights to 'eveywhere', slow and messy.",,,
2016,5,Love the feature that lets you just see what month and day is the cheapest. Makes travel planning so much easier. Plus you can see how well a particular flight/airline is rated by travelers and narrow down options.,,,
2016,5,"This is my go to app. It's so convenient for when I just want to look up a quick vacation or when I'm planning a bigger getaway. Such a life saver. Easy to use, reliable, works every time. I love it.",,,
2016,1,"Where is the search for a whole country?  Where is the search for everywhere?  Skyscanner used to stand out from all other flight search apps and websites,  but now it's just one of the worst!",,,
2016,5,Wonderful app that is easy to navigate. It constantly updates you about the price changes. I have purchased a flight ticke through it and am very happy about how it turned out for me. I highly recommend it.,,,
2016,1,New update makes this app useless for me. Now can only search for return flights. Can't search for whole month. Can't see chart easily. What gives?,,,
2016,2,Please can I go back to the previous version before the last update as this has made this app worse. I used to like this app before but now you are doing un necessary changes. Leave it alone!!!,,,
2016,1,The new update makes it so much harder to find the best deals.. and I can no longer search everywhere.. my favourite feature!,,,
2016,1,Loved the old app & used it all the time... the new one is pretty much unusable for browsing cheapest flights though. Really disappointed!,,,
2016,1,Now it is useless. All the useful featurs are gone. I kept getting error 51 when selecting dates for hotels. Unless they reverse the update soon. This app is uninstalled.,,,
2016,2,"Since July 2016 Skyscanner focusses on ""top deals"", which -for me- means I can't just search for random destinations anymore. Don't like this update",,,
2016,5,I have tried many applications for flight search but Skyscanner is the best out there. I like to search with date and graph. This makes me very easy to book cheap flights. Thanks to make this great application.,,,
2016,1,Ill be going elsewhere. Can no longer search everywhere so takes too long. You cant even search a country. Why why why?!!!!!! Just lost a long term customer,,,
2016,2,Horrible update... Before it was so easy to navigate and find the cheapest flights. Grouping the trips in weekends 3-5 days etc? Come on..,,,
2016,1,"Unusable after last update. What a shame. Can't search flights by countries, only specific airports. So dissapointed...uninstal",,,
2016,5,"This app has several flexible search modes including weekends, monthly, and price based searches.  Also based on your departing location it can suggest thrifty destinations.  Great for last minute spontaneous getaways.",,,
2016,1,It is no longer as simple as choosing two city's and some dates. Now I have to go to three pages just to state where I'm flying from. Please mix the old with the new,,,
2016,1,Where's the everywhere option gone? This app used to be fantastic but no more. I know the graph has been moved but it's a pain. In gutted :-( Please can it go back to about 12months ago before all the changes?,,,
2016,2,"The app before the update was much easier to use. And the ""search everywhere"" option is gone , which was the best feature! Bring back the old app!",,,
2016,1,"Change it back. I don't want photos of the place, I know what it looks like, that's why I'm looking for flights. Don't assume I'm flying from the UK. This was an unnecessary change.",,,
2016,1,"Skyscanner was a life saver, now I can't even select/match best departure and return flights. Prices haven't been shown.",,,
2016,1,I have many travel application and i can use all of them easily. Now i spend hours to understand how it works and i still don't understand. Horrible,,,
2016,1,"Worked perfectly? Now totally useless,  will be removing unless they listen to feedback and change. Can only hope common sense prevails here.  Hopefully not money making incentives with these changes.",,,
2016,1,The update is horrible and for people with wanderlust who want to view all their options have lost a wonderful app due to the update. Awful. Pervious set up was 100x better.,,,
2016,1,"Luckily the person in charge of the app didn't get his hands on the web site, which luckily still works nicely. This however is totally useless beyond belief.",,,
2016,1,Bring back the search 'Everywhere'...and even if it is possible it's not obvious or user friendly. I've reverted to using the browser,,,
2016,1,The new update is very difficult to use. Can't find anything. The previous version was much more user friendly and straight forward,,,
2016,1,I have used Skyscanner for a long time and I am shocked how they can take so many steps backwards in one update!!! Very poor and I will be using something else from now on!!!,,,
2016,1,When searching flights for everywhere on a certain date you are given a selection of random places. It used to be a list of countries in order of price. This was much more user friendly.,,,
2016,1,"New update has changed the whole app, can no longer view countries in lists. It's a shame as it was my go to flight app.",,,
2016,3,"Last one is much easier for users. I do not know why you changed the interface. Now, I do not know how to buy tickets in one way and choose date.",,,
2016,1,It used to give you an option of looking at anywhere from an airport which was fine if like me you're flexible. Also what happened to the graph telling you the prices for the whole month :-(,,,
2016,1,Why did you change the interface lately? It was the best app ever and now it's like all the others. Too bad...,,,
2016,2,I liked the fact that you could search for flights from the UK as a whole rather than the painstaking process if searching from each airport to find the best price. Saved a lot of time!,,,
2016,1,"the new updated one has destroyed the deals compare on ur app, is unable to search the best deal anymore! hopes u will fix it soon!",,,
2016,1,"The update removed all of the good features of this app and it is now impossible to find the cheapest flights, particularly if you aren't fussed where you are traveling to. Terrible update.",,,
2016,1,"This used to be a really good little app for finding flights but now they have tried to make it ""helpful"" it is rubbish. Searched for flights from Manchester to Germany for 20th November, got a page of flight offers for December, not what I wanted at all.",,,
2016,5,Very helpful app that helps me to see when best to book my flights. Bit confused after the update but the developers were helpful and polite and I managed to continue to use the app smoothly :),,,
2016,5,"One of the best apps I've ever used to search for flights with the most accurate results, simple but clearly detailed. And the new interface is great!",,,
2016,1,Used to be a great app. Did everything the mobile site did with ease. It's now not worth using. Absolutely terrible. Whoever is responsible should bet sacked!!!!,,,
2016,5,You can't find in any other App such great prices and offers. Keep Updating. All the best,,,
2016,1,Latest update really really really bad. Cannot choose whole month or everywhere... totally useless now... I recommend to NOT UPDATE,,,
2016,2,The app was so cool!! But in the last update the interface is horrible!! I can't find the cheapest flights anymore :(,,,
2016,3,About a year ago I reviewed this app saying how great it was except for the lack of multi city searches. When I just returned to the review I notices a reply from skyscanner saying it was now fixed. But as far as I can tell it is still unavailable.,,,
2016,2,"Now full of glitches.  You can't search anywhere and just look at countries anymore, you have to scroll through all destinations (with pictures attached, in case I am booking by photograph???). Why not leave a great app alone???üò†",,,
2016,1,Price of KLM flight to South Africa wildly different on Skyscanner (¬£767) to KLM own website (¬£563). That's + ¬£204!,,,
2016,1,I thought Ive done something wrong with my app. After reading reviews realised that its an update that messed up such a great app,,,
2016,1,Please listen to the chorus here and go back to your winning formula. This update hasn't been well received.,,,
2016,1,Was my fave app of all time - you could randomly chose where to go with the everywhere function - now that seems to have dissapeared and the menu is too complicated - I have seen others with similar reviews about the updates and Skyscanner replying heat the everywhere option is still there but has to be accessed from a menu - too complicated - I will dump it for now and see if it gets updated again soon and returns to a fun and functional app again,,,
2016,1,Previous version much better and user friendly. Too much of a pain to search all flights to one destination and thus choose cheaper options.,,,
2016,3,Used to spend ages browsing for best deals and always booked through skyscanner. Now   that functionality is gone so will try other apps.,,,
2016,5,"Always gives the best & lowest flight rates... Better then any search engine like expedia, priceline, etc.... Definite must have for any traveler!!!",,,
2016,5,"I only use this app to find the best prices! It's convenient, easy to use and I haven't found lower rates anywhere else",,,
2016,1,There does not seem to be a feature to show which days are cheaper to fly on. That was the best part about using skyscanner. Deleting now.,,,
2016,5,Most used app on my phone. No bugs no issues. Excellent for finding cheap flights,,,
2016,3,"Hi, latest version lost the ability to do country searches such as ""UK"" or ""Everywhere"". Now just another App, what a shame.",,,
2016,1,Newest update ruined it. Can't get a graph of prices for any flight. Just guess work. Rubbish.,,,
2016,1,This new version doesn't allow you to look at flights to a whole country or any destination. This is probably what will kill Skyscanner,,,
2016,3,I will use another search app until this one is improved or fixed. Why constantly update apps only to make them worse.,,,
2016,4,Easy to Use & Maneuver flights. I use it to watch my desire flights. Very useful tool. Recommended..,,,
2016,1,"From my most used to travel app to useless in one update. The best thing about the app was the total flexibility in searching, which is now gone.",,,
2016,3,Wow .. i never leave a review and i hope that the owners of this APP are listening .. i used too love this APP right too the point .. Now it got like every other app it ..it used to be people friendly you gave the dates and  were your going that's it now there all this other extra stuff and I don't like it I wish you could go back to the way it was simple I used to tell everybody about this app now I'm not too happy with this app I hope the owners of this app take it back to the way it was simple ... tks,,,
2016,3,"Good overview of available flights and prices around the globe, but could find cheaper prices not mentioned in Skyscanner.",,,
2016,5,"I love the app. It has helped me book flights to Phuket, Gran Canaria, and there will be many more destinations.",,,
2016,1,The new update really sucks.. it's difficult to find the cheapest flights. I didn't like it..,,,
2016,5,Really helped me find the cheapest flight possible. Showed me comparisons. The filter feature allowed me to search the flight that suited me.,,,
2016,5,I've always used this app to book my flights and find deals! Never let's me down!,,,
2016,1,I never write reviews at all but you have totally ruined the app made it so much harder it's not easy to use anymore absolute fail....,,,
2016,1,New update makes the app unusable for anyone willing to fly from anywhere in country's also unable to check flights to anywhere.,,,
2016,1,I used to use this app all the time for flights. Ever since the 'upgrade' I have to use the website instead as the app is so restrictive.,,,
2016,2,App used to be great but now can't even search one way flights and it's so difficult to try out different destinations or start points!,,,
2016,1,"The search to ""Everywhere"" option which is the one of the main reasons why I and most friends use sky scanner is terrible now , its not even possible to search everywhere one way ? Also if it was possible to search from ""Everywhere"" to a destination aswell that would be great",,,
2016,5,"Can you guys please add the capability to chose the class as ANY.. so that I can see all the options available.. Other than that great app and as always best website ever, been using it for more than 5 years",,,
2016,1,You're thankful for the feedback?! Don't kidding me: you've killed the application! Useless. Completely useless.,,,
2016,3,"The new update is not so good, it is still useful, but I really miss the calendar, and the way it used to sort the destinations by country first now is a kinda messy",,,
2016,2,It is easy to use and I like the application per se but the travel agency I found at your site ripped me of !!  You have a bad partner Ôºö(((,,,
2016,4,I have been pleased with this app so far. I find some great deals by using it.,,,
2016,2,The newest update is dreadful. Pointlessly complicated. Don't fix what's not broke.,,,
2016,2,the new updated version is very frustrating and difficult to use. the older one was way better,,,
2016,1,I wanted to check one way flights to anywhere for a specific date. No one way nor everywhere option.,,,
2016,5,it's a great way to find cheap flights. set an alert and buy when the price is right!,,,
2016,1,the app is getting less user friendly.  hard to search and too much unnecessary fancy design,,,
2016,5,A very big help to travelers who want to get the biggest bang for their buck without surfing too many sites. Great job developers!,,,
2016,1,"Annoying to use after update. Difficult to view ""all month"" flights or daily flights on bar graph.",,,
2016,1,Used to be the best app for flights. Of course they had to change the design and ruin it.,,,
2016,2,"The new interface can't do what it used to be able to. Can I ""downgrade""?",,,
2016,2,"The regular site allows searching to flights anywhere (no specific destination specified) and cheapest month dates, but the app does not.",,,
2016,5,I like the app but i liked it before better and now I don't like the prices no moe good deals,,,
2016,5,You cab keep a watch on a flight to see that price is changing and a lot more. Great app,,,
2016,5,"This one is really a good application, user-friendly . Comparison of flights rates  in one place .",,,
2016,5,"One of, if not the best app for finding the lowest price on airfare. Can usually find a price at least $5 lower than similar apps.",,,

2016,1,"Why change it, keep it simple! Would have been 5 star if not changed!",,,
2016,3,Now when I search anywhere it gives me only the US.  Before I could search by country.  This new set up sux,,,
2016,1,The new update has made the app a pain to use. Utterly disappointed,,,
2016,1,Worst update ever. Please go back to previous version,,,
2016,4,The new user interface is fairly intuitive with a few quirks but once you've used it a couple of times you get used to it pretty quickly.,,,
2016,1,Used to be able to search from.all airports in UK to everywhere but since the upgrade this  can't be done. Not happy,,,
2016,2,"There are no filters to sort by alliance, nor does it display booking category beyond just 'Economy' and the like.",,,
2016,4,"I think this is my favorite app for finding flights, works well.",,,
2016,4,Awesome app..Not only aggregate fares from various platforms but also have some useful filtering options.,,,
2016,1,"Used to be such a good app...new update is horrendous, so difficult to search and find anything anymore.",,,
2016,5,It shows a lot of information about many trips. It finds the best options.,,,
2017,1,"Keeps on saying no result for 8-9 times, then shows result. Very annoying.",,,
2016,3,Please add the everywhere wildcard option. Will have to use the website in the meantime...,,,
2016,5,"Best prices all in on place.  It would be good if you could add all details, e.g. how many stops, in a price alert.",,,
2016,4,Great App...though not keen on new search. I always have to go to quick search.,,,
2016,1,Best app with last update just became piece of crap,,,

2016,4,Shows a lot of options for flights with details and prices.,,,

2016,2,I decided to remove app as I wasn't able to search flights into one city and out of another.,,,
2016,4,I think it would be good to have push notifications of any recent flight searches from other people that are unusually low or for any flash flight sales,,,
2016,3,The new update has such a pathetic and confusing interface,,,
2016,5,Please take care of budget air prices coz it is changed- once I enter my name- to the actual price from company site.,,,
2016,4,Great app! Helps me locate the strange and out of way places,,,

2016,1,Last application version was excellent now this apps updated and not of any use,,,
2016,4,The only problem is that I am not able to search for one way flights.,,,
2016,5,Love this app. I travelled Europe twice in the past 9 months using this,,,
2016,2,All the added photos are ruining searches which was the greatest benefit,,,
2016,1,Before its good but after update totally useless why....,,,
2016,5,"I always use that app in my travels, so wide and many ways of sorting, I love it",,,
2016,5,I find it easy to check out the best flight deals to suit me,,,
2016,5,You can find out the cheapest air faire through using this apps...,,,
2016,1,"runied the search flexibility ,i hate the update version",,,
2016,5,Easy and vary simple and vary cheap also no extra cost or charges thnx,,,
2016,5,I love the fact that you can scan multiple airlines to compare prices.,,,
2016,5,They use a lot of smaller airlines also which is great for short trips.,,,
2016,1,...although in this case most of us are just waiting for a step back.,,,
2016,5,Easy to use & cheapest rates available from trusted airlines.,,,
2016,1,Bring back the 'cheapest month' and 'go anywhere' option !,,,
2016,5,Excellent app. Easy to use and saves a lot of time.,,,
2016,5,I always have it installed on all my phones and pads,,,

2016,2,"The app isn't perfect for backpackers who don't know where or when there going.  I prefer using the website as you can use it to find the cheapest month. The app previously had this. It also doesn't update prices when you've clicked ""show flights"". Could be a great app with a little more market research. (I've used Skyscanner many times over the years and they're one of the best)",,,
2016,2,"Been using it for yrs but new update really sux. Pls bring back the old interface!! 1. The bar to narrow down departure/arrival time doesn't work. 2. To pick a different city to ""fly from"" u have to return to the very beginning & input everything again. 3. To select direct flight u have to click into the calendar everytime. What happened to the simple, sleek and user-friendly(!!!) old version? Now it involves so many more clicks and doesn't even do the same. Bring back the old version!!",,,
2016,1,"I have used this app for years and have sworn by it. The newest updates have made me want to uninstall it all together. I can't search for one way flights to ""Everywhere"" and I can't search for flights leaving ""Anytime"". I have to pick a specific month with a return, as well. I have been traveling without a schedule for quite some time and those features were invaluable to me. Now it is just like all the other search engines. Major downgrade.",,,
2016,4,"Hello! Honestly I love your app because the deals and the simplicity to use it. However, it would be great if you inform on the flight the baggage information instead of tying to see in each airlines. Other apps like yours give baggage information so don't let them enjoy it as a competitive advantage. Because if no baggage information is not available in yours honestly I will reserve my tickets on other place. Regards!",,,
2016,1,This used to be the best app I use for years to go away 3-5 times a year on random adventures. Just spent 30 mins trying to find even one flight! In that time I used to have searched the whole world of flights. Unusable in every way. Can no longer find any flights. I'm sure air operators will lose money now. I for one will not be using again or going away end of July as planned!,,,
2016,5,"I am absolutely thrilled!  Happy tears!  I wasn't able to afford a trip to see my sister, until a friend recommended skyscanner for flights & hotels. With those two apps I saved $350 total and now I'm able to afford a trip to see her!  Booking was extremely easy and user friendly on my phone. Thank you so much, HIGHLY recommend! &lt;3",,,
2016,1,"What is this crap? They took the best working app of all of them and turned it into the worst! It just went from a five star to a one star. Very disappointing skyscanner. And that after all my years of loyalty. Why do you have to keep ""improving"" ? It was perfect already the way it was before this stupid update. Change it back.",,,
2016,1,"Where did the chart go??? Now this is just another flight search like the rest of them. Will be switching to Google flights I guess as this is no longer useful when you cant view the prices by each day of the month at a glance, resulting in tedious date switching over and over = just like any other flight app. Lame.",,,
2016,1,The new update is terrible. This used to be my go to app for booking flights as it could always find the cheapest flights across flexible destinations. Now it doesn't perform this basic function and requires a specific destination. Please revert to the old software!,,,
2016,1,Why fix it if it's not broken!? Every update is a downgrade. Wasn't keen on the last big update but this one is a total nightmare. Can't simply check from A to everywhere nor does it give me one way option. The current set up is def not a positive one. It used to be easy& straight forward. why overcomplicate things?,,,
2016,5,"SkyScanner is a brilliant application. It's user friendly interface makes it easy to understand and use the application. Allows you to put price change alerts, helps you cross check rates across all major flyers and airlines as well offers various filters like duration, price, airline etc to fit each specific search according to your travel needs. The application does not just allow you to survey the market but also make the airline end booking and ensures your plan is set to fly off.",,,
2016,1,No idea why you have changed it. Best feature removed.... can no longer choose Uk as departure point and have to select specific airport which takes an age and it's now no quicker than using the individual budget airline websites...,,,
2016,1,I was using your app all the time but now it just doesn't work for me. Where is the oprion of searching chepest daily flights for the whole month? I will need to look for a new app if you will not bring old options back.,,,
2016,2,"I used to love this app, but the constant unnecessary updates and changes have ruined this app for me. It is now more complicated to search for flights, thus making the app less likeable, more difficult and less likely for me to recommend to my friends and family.    You should change it back.",,,
2016,1,As title says. Got rid of all the convenient features. Can now only search for specific cities rather than countries. Also no easy way to find the cheapest flights. Website is still great but the app is ruined.,,,
2016,1,Every time I search for a flight now and want to see a different date it takes you right back to the home page and you have to put your preferences all back in again. Totally frustrating. Wont use now if this is not sorted.,,,
2016,3,I got this app to find an airplane ticket for my grand daughter she is 9 and has been flying repeatedly several times a year from Texas to Maryland but found out it can't help me when I look for a ticket for her it adds an adult ticket automatically and she Flys alone. So it doesn't work for what I need. I guess it would be OK for couples or family.,,,
2016,2,Tried to see what flights were available for the second week in December between MTJ-SJO and you only came up with American.  I know United has more flights and better prices.  What gives?,,,
2016,1,"Took me about 5 minutes to find a one  way flight in the new version. To go from such an easy to use app, to practically unusable in one update, I'm almost impressed with dev team",,,
2016,1,"I just hate the last updates, its terrible I used to love this app with the older older version! It was soo easy too use! I will search for a new app to replace this one.",,,
2016,1,The latest update ruined a perfectly good app. I'm going to uninstall it now until the features which made the app useful are brought back - unless anyone knows how to keep the app but uninstall the latest updates?,,,
2016,4,it's very helpful.. I feel that I always found the best price flight with skyscanner. Thanks for always with me in every my traveling..,,,
2016,1,The new update is terrible. Can not search everywhere from my nearest airport. Can not search best prices in the month. Hope i find another company that was like how this used to be.,,,
2016,4,Are now non existent on the app....but i do like all the other addons like hotels and cars.  Still irritated i cannot do one way flights though.,,,
2016,5,Great app. Have not booked any flight yet from it. But the information they are giving in this one application is really awesome.,,,
2016,1,"There is no options such as ""multi-cities""! Only round trip, it is useless! Please add that function!",,,
2016,1,You've now removed the functionality to search a country as opposed to a specific area of the country?! Are you mad?! Almost like you are trying to drive your users away!,,,
2016,5,I love this apps. It gets u the best price and also rates up the price based on the quality of the whole flight experience (the time it takes to travel),,,
2016,2,It's wonderful that the app tells me what the lowest rate for a one way flight is. But not allowing one to book our even indicating what airline the flight is with renders the application useless.,,,
2016,1,"Useless,  please we want the previous version.  You just ruin a really good app",,,
2016,1,How come you changed the way it searches for flights? It's so much harder to look for cheaper deals now...,,,
2016,5,Absolutely helpful if u looking for flights... checking on all competitive sites n getting the best deal ...,,,
2016,1,I can't select one way. I cant select everywhere. I can't... and the filters good for nothing. Looks more and more as momondo but worst than.,,,
2016,4,Not sure if the latest update is a plus but other than that it has been a good tool to get some references,,,
2016,4,Saves me the time of looking for tickets for flights when it monitors them for me itself. Less worry about when to get a purchase done,,,
2016,5,I just need to choose where I want go and it does its job to provide me price options of my flight...indeed...Helpful,,,
2016,1,The older version was a life saver for me. But now it just left me dead on phone. I want the older version.,,,
2016,2,The only reason i downloaded sky scanner was for their ability of booking multiple journeys in their website but unfortunately it is not available in their app...its similar to any other travel booking app..,,,
2016,3,"Add the country wise search for flights ,like all airport price from destination that will be helpful",,,
2016,5,Really easy to use and always get my flights on here unless they are part of a package deal!,,,
2016,4,Why did you change it? It was perfect how it was. Now I need to pick a month instead of it telling me which one is cheapest.,,,
2016,5,"Very easy to use, and it has the cheapest flights around. Perfect for a weekend getaway.",,,
2016,1,I booked a ticket in using this App which costed me 100‚Ç¨ more than what is shown in Website. No use of having this app.,,,
2016,1,I used this app and I but all the details include my bank card and they said that they will send me a message on my email  but they don't how can I make sure please help me and also they didn't ask about my passport number it's not normal,,,
2016,5,Skyscanner invariably finds the best flights. It's where I start all my travel plans.,,,
2016,5,"It help me too much ... thank you for developers , and advice them to update it.",,,
2016,4,Please add multi location flight checking option just as you have it on the web module,,,
2016,5,Always use this app for all the flights I book. Really good and secure !,,,
2016,5,Easy and very helpful..... Booking flights could never be as joyable like that !!!,,,
2016,1,"New application Is so stupid you cannot find anything, 2 days searching for option one way :((((",,,
2016,5,Really loved it. Cheapest price ever & very smooth application.,,,
2016,5,Cheap great and effective. I have been using it for all my travels.,,,
2016,1,This latest up date does not work for android on samsung been using this app faultless for 3 years until latest.,,,
2016,5,Shows well and accurate information in perfect ways and connect you with flights around you,,,
2016,1,After the update is very disappointing...hope they will manage to improve the app.,,,
2016,5,Loved that there are more budget airlines to choose from. Thanks,,,
2016,1,The new update is dificult to use. Please change it back.,,,
2016,4,muy buena la app. pwro faltan aerolineas de bajo costo,,,
2016,4,"Completely functional, but maybe the interface should be more simple.",,,
2016,1,"The most recent update has ruined the functionality, beyond useless.",,,
2016,1,I shall have to uninstall the app because of disapearing of a calendar of prices..,,,
2016,5,"If you're flying anywhere,  get this app.  You won't regret it!",,,
2016,4,Good app to choose cheap flighs operating on the given route.,,,
2016,3,I am geting lesser price while searching but while finalising it is giving higher price.,,,
2016,4,Nearest to the best rates available online on carrier website.,,,
2016,1,I can't even figure out how to use it anymore. I'm only 25,,,
2016,1,The developers have undid all the best features of the app.,,,
2016,5,"Quick, easy and even sends you updated price changes.",,,
2016,5,"Very simple,informative with several options to help you decide",,,
2016,5,I think anyone would travel this app will be very useful & helpful to use,,,
2016,5,It's one of the best traveller scheduler I have ever seen,,,
2016,5,Best application to get all information at one place,,,
2016,5,Was able to get a great price by following your price alerts,,,
2016,2,Where is the options to search the cheepest dates / month for a flight ?,,,
2016,5,Why do you need an access to my photos files and for my external SD card?,,,
2016,1,"I would constantly use this app to search for the best monthly prices, but now you can only search my date, like every other generic flight app. If I didn't know what date I wanted to go to a certain place, I could easily use the monthly checker, why the hell would you take this out? I see you haven't removed it from your webpage, so why from your app? Change it back, or you'll lose a lot of your app users.",,,
2017,2,"No more ability to search ""anytime""?  Searching anytime used to be possible for one way tickets too.   The new search results are disappointing now without country heirarchal sorting.   When I search for ""Brazil to everywhere"" I get a sea of Brazilian cities.   How is this useful?   This app was a unique gem with it's extreme flexibility in finding the cheapest times or countries to find amazing deals,  but now,  it's just like any other.   Please,  don't change the website,  at least I can still use that.",,,
2016,1,"This used to be the best app for broad flight searches, I loved being able to search everywhere, by whole countries or the whole year to find the cheapest flights. New update however is horrendous, not user friendly at all and destroys all the features that made Skyscanner great and different from all other flight sites. Very sad that I can no longer use this app for my travels",,,
2016,2,"App appears very limited. Functionality when looking at flights is presently limited, cannot choose a different return destination (i.e. multi-destination) additionally one way wasnt an option either. Was hoping this app would be very user friendly. However i am sure this is very easy to fix & look forward to using when it is.",,,
2016,2,was a good app that did lots of things well. the last few updates have ruined it all. request you to bring back the old app with the clean UI in the current one. don't fix what's not broken in the name of development. look forward to seeing the app back in former glory.,,,
2016,1,They replied to my comment but I accidentally deleted my comment. Anyway neither the chart nor the calendar shows the prices anymore. It used to be that you can see the price while scrolling through the chart view. That was a useful feature. I am a little flexible with travel dates so I use the feature to find the cheapest price of a time period.,,,
2016,2,I book all my flights through sky scanner...about 15 in total so far love this app.    *edited* i really hate the new update please  change √≠t back im having to look √°t other sites aswell as trying to  use this one =( it used t√¥ b√™ so great.,,,
2016,1,"What are you thinking by making me choose specific destinations and exact dates. The five star element of the old app was choosing anytime and finding the best prices. This app is now unusable crap and I'll be deleting it, having used it happily for years. Idiots!",,,
2016,1,"Not as practical and clear as ot use to be. And on top of that finds f all. The dates I was looking at ""no direct flights and all the rest ¬£700 ¬£800 went online found 2 direct flights for ¬£300 return so don't use that its misleading as hell",,,
2016,1,"Used to love it but now I hate it! the new update  doesn't let you search the whole month or just fly from the UK you have to put a particular airport in! What a load of crap, why mess with something that didn't need fixing!",,,
2016,1,Skyscanner it wasn't broken so why did you fix it? I now have to specify my destination. Can no longer put in UK or everywhere. Get rid of the hotel and rental we want you for flights!,,,
2016,1,"The whole reason Skyscanner was better than all the rest, is because if you were flexible.. It allowed you to look at flights without restriction. Searching from ""United kingdom"" to ""everywhere"" at ""anytime"" of the year showed you the best price. Now I have to specify an airport??! What even is this?? Expedia??",,,
2016,5,This app is so perfect and accurate just no more worries even for last minute flights...  Always so convenient and reliable and cost-effective way to show the prices on each day so that you can plan your travel on less expensive days...,,,
2016,5,"I really like the UI of the app. It has been made very user friendly, easy to handle. I like how I am shown the cheapest days even before I select my dates, letting me alter my plans accordingly.",,,
2016,5,"Launching the app freezes my screen. I can't even turn the phone off, the only thing  I can do to restart it is removing the battery. :(",,,
2016,5,"Thank you for making UI easier to navigate!  FYI, VietnamAirline fares in the app is not included full tax and fees making it looks like the best fares but it's not.",,,
2016,1,Change it back. It's barely usable compared to a few months ago. It seems both less functional and less user-friendly at the same time.,,,
2016,3,My go to place for booking flights as you do find cheap flights... just don't believe the price it says because once you get to checkout it has increased,,,
2016,2,"Where have these options gone? Ruined the app now by having to put exactly where you want to go rather than being able to see where is the cheapest or from which UK airport is the cheapest to go from. Disappointed, was a 5 star app before",,,
2016,1,"Hate the new set up.....so hard to use now..used to be able to search whole months at a time, selecting random dates. Now it asks for specific dates. .change it back please! !!",,,
2016,2,I can no longer search for Ireland to a specific country.. only lets me pick a specific airport and not the whole island ... along with other update nuances ..,,,
2016,5,We love to travel thats why we're always using this apps. This app makes my job a lot easier. Thanks skyscanner...hope to see more cheaper flights from you!!!:-))),,,
2016,5,"So far this is the most useful app to book the cheapest possible flights.  If there's any better,  I'd be surprised.",,,
2016,1,Everytime this app is updated it gets worse. I dont want pictures. I want to search for flights. Stop it please. A great app ruined!,,,
2016,1,Displays the price but how can I select that flight it is not given anywhere. It is like attracting you with low prices and then leaving you mid way!!,,,
2016,5,Been using Skyscanner for about 4 years now. Very reliable and great rates!  Love the way you can look at an entire month's overview and pick accordingly.,,,
2016,4,"I use to pre plan every business and leisure trip  trough this App.Very Handy also in case you need to replan quickly a trip via different Airports.I may suggest : function to invert departure to destination, and a function to check quickly 2/3 days before and after the investigated date.",,,
2016,3,Pretty much useless without the multi city option. Seems like a pretty basic feature to have that Kayak does really well.,,,
2016,1,How do I even conduct an effective search without a multi city option? That's why I downloaded the app in the first place...it's totally useless to me now,,,
2016,5,Brilliant best app ever works flawless gives you a great oversight of your flight a rating of 10 plus keep up the gd work!,,,
2016,5,Always helpful when I want to get a flight. Even though it doesn't keep the same prices always when going to the flight company website to finish booking.,,,
2016,5,"Just the way I wanted. Easy UI , fast results. Low fare calendar is just excellent.",,,
2016,1,"This is now hopeless, used to like to random places that you could get to when selecting 'everywhere' as a destination, even if it took a couple of flights to get there, now it's all ruined and not enjoyable anymore",,,
2016,5,"Love this app...easy to use , good visiualizations for people to get the best price and plan thier trips",,,
2016,4,It's helpful and I'll find a wide range of opportunities that it might help in choosing ur flight and what I like the most is the rating of each flight based on the time and money u should give a try your gona Luv it,,,
2016,3,I have noticed many times websites you send us to do not have the same prices why can Expedia guarantee the price of prefer Skyscanner but I always end up checking Expedia to make sure ticket price is accurate,,,
2016,3,"Not bad, but doesn't offer much over and above the website experience. Difficult to do that really as the website is good and the main focus for the company.",,,
2016,1,Was looking at prices for 2 adult and one infant. ...this junkie program will charge full fare for the infant.....,,,
2016,1,Bunch of Indian crooks calling after booking a fare asking for more money. Do NOT book with these guys. Crooks,,,
2016,5,It saves lots of standard prices. Saves masses of time too. Dependable.,,,
2016,1,The new update is awful this app is unusable now. Bring back the old version asap.,,,
2016,5,Found a cheaper flight using this app in my first search haha awesome. Going to add it to my arsenal,,,
2016,4,Like it very much.  Gives reasonable  amount of options.  I use it frequently.,,,
2016,1,It's not user friendly. Old version was easy to understand!,,,
2016,5,"One of the best apps i ever used. Just mega mega fluid and so handy to work with, Very helpful. üòâ",,,
2016,5,Every travellers dream app. What's better than having a SKY scanner on your hands? ;),,,
2016,5,Easy to use.... and love it how it shows and compares the prices,,,
2016,5,Saved me bundles on flights using your app. Thanks guys,,,
2016,5,Best app to compare prices of flights and find cheapest tickets üòä,,,
2016,4,I havent had much exposure to this app yet. But it looks good!,,,
2016,5,Helpful and very useful. Easy to use. Better than Expedia,,,
2016,3,The prices shown NEVER turn out to be correct and usually double or even more when you click on them.,,,
2016,1,What have you done. This was a great app you've ruined it it's awful !!!,,,
2016,5,Guys..nothing to describe...if you want to pick the best n track your flight..u r at the right place!!,,,
2016,4,"Wish it would do a multi city trip search, otherwise I would rate it a 10 out of 5!",,,
2016,1,The graph system was far the best way to book via this site,,,
2016,4,App is grand but the hotel option would be good too,,,
2016,1,When redirected to websites prices are often different to the ones showing in the app,,,
2016,2,Recent update has resulted in me using sky scanner on browser more than I use the app.,,,
2016,5,If you know you want to go to a destination  but are flexible with your travel dates this app is a real winner!,,,
2016,5,No matter what screen size you use sky scanner is effective and user friendly,,,
2016,5,"amazing app, gives u access to the cheapest flights from across the world",,,
2016,5,In this application fares also quite less when compare to other applications.,,,
2016,5,An awesome app which makes finding prices at great prices even easier on the go,,,
2016,5,Easy friendly and certainly the best prices in one place,,,
2016,1,Where did the everywhere option and the charts go??,,,
2016,3,Found cheaper tickets going to the airlines website then on here,,,

2016,2,"I started using Skyscanner when I was travelling more for work and back to visit my family. My usual airline was getting expensive and I needed to find the cheapest flights. This worked for my usual routes - now I find time to plan my dream holiday in the Dominican Republic. I find a lot of days no flights are shown, and if I select a departure date it will only show return flights within 10 days. Other return flights just disappear. However if I search for flights with airlines it's any day I want.",,,
2017,3,"I'm rating this app three stars because of the functionality it once had and because I'm optimistic the developers will fix the issues.   The last 4 or 5 times I've dreamingly plugged in dates for an international escape later this year the app has come up with no search results. I adjust dates to even a month out and still zero results come up. I used to love daydreaming with this app, you know...plugging in hypothetical vacation dates just to see what the cost would amount to. Hopefully this will be fixed and I can continue dreaming without using google to search for prices and trip durations.",,,
2017,5,"Feel good about the Skyscanner. However It seems airpaz is the only non-trustworthy agency on Skyscanner that Skyscanner should seriously consider the soonest possible for the interest of its android clients either to become trustworthy or or get kicked out of the Skyscanner listing. Once you attempt to finish an incomplete booking on airpaz, the price will be increased ridiculously, but the original price is still available using a new user. Also a lot of complaints on internet about the dishonesty of airpaz kind of cheating money many times either confiscating money along with the flight ticket purchase failure without being able to contact airpaz consequently for a refund or cancelling ticket confirmation without informing airpaz customer.",,,

2017,1,Does this app only work for some countries?  Trying to look for flights from Montreal to South Africa to any of the major airport as well as changing the dates but it doesn't show anything,,,
2017,1,Not sure what happened. Used it fine up till Feb 2017 and now it keeps showing no results no matter what I search. Wonder if it has to do with acquisition,,,
2016,4,"Reliable, honest results from a large range of airlines. The prices are not as hard to beat as they used to be though.",,,
2016,4,"Great app, especially appreciate the email updates of when flight prices change. ..you just need to try it",,,
2017,3,hard to adjust flight schedules when rates aren't clear ...takes time to reload unlike earlier versions,,,
2017,3,"Not bad, but not complete enough to make me not revert to the website. Biggest missing option is to search nearby airports, both departure and destination",,,
2016,5,I always use this app to source my flights. However I only buy the flights either directly from the airline or a reputable agent like expedia ebooker etc. Beware of small time agents!,,,
2016,4,Good app for flight bookings.. Great comparisons of lowest fares,,,
2017,2,After reinstalling everything is working fine and it's easy to plan trips. Awesome.,,,
2016,4,"Allows you to see flight a vailibility, and cost. Good app.",,,
2017,1,This terrible app send me to gotogate when i bought fly tickets. Totally scam. The worst experience ever,,,
2016,5,Love the app. Whatever connection it recommend. I got the same from agents as well,,,
2016,5,This apps is so best and all flight details not offer price,,,
2016,3,Compared flight price ...sometimes not reasonable price..tq,,,
2017,1,Searces continually return no results..used to love skyscanner...given up now,,,
2016,1,It always says no result. I wrote all the dates but not successful.,,,
2016,5,The feature of viewing the prices for whole month is just awesome.,,,
2016,5,Taking advantage of offers. Found many deals to the Caribbean,,,
2018,1,Used to be great but they have changed it and now it is totally useless,,,
2016,1,Price shown is in gbp but currency mentioned is Rs. Its a bug.,,,
2016,5,Having a reliable reference for the availabity and bracket amount of flight throughout the world so I dont have to btowse each and every website,,,
2016,4,"I don't know, if I can search multi cities flights.",,,
2017,4,awesome app..friendly userinterface..simple to navigate..buy tickets,,,
2017,5,I love this app cuz  MOST of the time I find very cheap tickets here..,,,
2016,5,"Great site, no problems found, brilliant for organising individual flight plans",,,
2016,5,i can get the cheapest flight with the several option of airlines,,,
2017,5,It is a perfect upper with many advantages and useful cualifications,,,
2016,5,Hamara ky yaro hum hi dewana hamari taraf ko koy na jana,,,
2017,5,Planning flights to Lombok Island for family booking ticket for December 2017,,,
2016,1,"New update is shizen! You have to know the name of the capital city of every country to search flights, dunno how good your geography is mr.Skyscanner..... but mines not that great. You guys had a good thing going on but now, ehhhhhhhh. Think ill check out some other sites.",,,
2016,1,"You can no longer change any search parameters (like direct flights only, economy,etc) until after you've done a useless basic search only by destination. At that point all the previous info is no longer valid and previous steps a waste of time. Even within Europe you get useless results with 3 connection flights and travel time of 15hrs for what should be 2hr journeys, only to find that when you select direct flight only there aren't any. Then you have to start from the beginning.",,,
2016,1,"From start to end after all pages you going through,  they try to justify why the initial price is became double and more...scam. All this passing from app to flights providers sites...everyone look to find a reason to get you pay more. Reinvent yourself... Ideea was good",,,
2016,4,"OK, so generally this seems fine. Personally though I feel the options of this and similar apps could be so much better. Living in rural UK for example, I have to travel to ANY airport and would find an option that gave me (say) the best prices to a destination (or any destination) from ANY north east airport most useful. Even any airport within a given radius of my location?",,,
2016,1,This used to be one of my favourite apps for usability and user experience. So easy to navigate and find flights on a mobile device. Since the update it's nearly impossible. Resorted to the website until it's sorted. The app just doesn't make sense anymore from an end user perspective.,,,
2016,1,Do not attempt to reengage me through notifications (!) for a service I need only every few months. Squelching ALL notifications from an app using the OS settings is NOT a solution against abuse of device functionality and is a violation of developer guidelines.   Uninstalled after three years of use.,,,
2016,5,"Very easy to use. Provides a bar graph to easily view the best dates to go places without having to re-enter information. Subscribe tool is great to notify price changes. Overall, best app I've seen to find best deals on flights.",,,
2016,5,"Great application, everything works smoothly and with ease. Simplistic design which gets you what you want and fast! Plus you get no annoying adds. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to get accurate flight information and book flights for any price quickly and with super ease.",,,
2016,5,"This app is everything a traveler would need, who is on a budget and still want to travel the world.  Easy to use, takes the hassle and stress out of looking flights as well as converting to the currency you are paying with. Also has tons of other useful tools.",,,
2016,1,If you're searching multiple destinations and want to go back and forth the usability is bad. You keep having to press the back button to each airport (departure/arrival) separately and recent searches are way below the keyboard on screen. It's just really clunky to use and needs improvement,,,
2016,1,New update without the anywhere &  anytime option is such a big step back that I have removed the app. Flexibility  of looking for the best price is what made this app unique. Edited the review to include the loss of anywhere & anytime option after feedback from the developer.,,,
2016,5,"Hands down the ultimate airfare ticket finder app you will ever need. Even cheaper prices than Google Matrix website. Nice design, easy to use, the price trend feature is very helpful. Highly recommended.",,,
2016,5,I have always checked and booked flights through sky scanner and I love it! If there are any issues it's usually with the linked sites and can be sorted out easily. Keep up the good work üòâ,,,
2016,5,I travel a lot every year. This app makes it easy! Definitely the best out there if u wanna make sure u get the most options& the cheapest flight. Google should just buy it & make it the standard Google flight!,,,
2016,3,Good app but when you buy the tickets on some sites you get a email back saying sorry the price has changed to get your flight you need to pay the extra. What's the point of finding cheap flights if the price isn't the true cost of the flight.,,,
2016,5,"Intuitive, sorts results in any order you need. Works without having to login to just research flights. Includes Southwest, doesn't charge any fees. Highly recommend!",,,
2016,5,The app itself does what you ideally do before booking a flight - find the cheapest airfare deals available from multiple agents. And the experience is smooth and hassle-free!  Just loving this app.,,,
2016,5,"I've used Skyscanner for a couple years to plan all the flights for my various trips, and it has definitely helped out a lot! They are getting a lot more efficient too, mostly cosmetic but also in making it simpler and quicker to find the cheapest rates",,,
2016,4,I clicked the bell button but it says 'unable to create price alert'. This is a really good app but would love it if this could be fixed. Thanks !,,,
2016,5,"I like the UI it is clean and easy to find whatever you are looking for and the search is fast for the number of results and air companies it is retrieving data. also can't leave behind the ""alert"" feature that sends email when there is a significant price change.",,,
2016,1,New update is awful and messy and makes it incredibly difficult to do some things in the name of making the design sleeker. Can no longer easily browse the cheapest flights to anywhere instead have to enter a destination,,,
2016,5,"Great and easy way to search for cheap flights. Gives suggestions on cheapest time to fly. Has an option to look at flights for ""Everywhere"" to see the best deals for international and domestic flights.",,,
2016,4,Nice interface and unparalleled aggregation. I have just one complaint. They don't allow flights to be filtered on refundability on cancellation.,,,
2016,4,Great app and ive used it lots of times. But ive just updated it and the price comparison between days is gone? Is the button that used to be at the top moved somewhere else as it was great to compare prices between several days?,,,
2016,4,Excellent application that searches all Airlines even the low budget ones. Share function is awesome. Please add multi-city search option!,,,
2016,4,"For instance, notifications on a specific flight combo with specific departure and arrival times would be more useful. Or at least notifications that take the filter into account i. e. notify when prices drop but only within the filter parameters.",,,
2016,5,Reliable. I love how they also have PHP availabl e as currency while others have very limited available currencies. Makes it easier for me to find good flights as i dont need to convert anymore,,,
2016,4,"I'm using this app for couple of years now, and managed to get better prices for my overseas  trips then in any of travel agency. Thanks",,,
2016,4,"The new version is very user friendly and really useful.  Just missing to be able to search for multiple-stop trips (A to B, then B to C and then C to A)",,,
2016,5,Amazing app. We can find cheapest flight ever. Also the app recommended us a star vise catagory so it can helpfull for us also,,,
2016,5,Have not yet made any booking. But the interface is very cool and pricing seems transparent.  Thumps up.,,,
2016,4,Great and efficient app. I would love to be able to search multi-city flights just like on the website though.,,,
2017,4,"Great app! User friendly, best prices. Does it accept all credit cards from.around.the world?",,,
2016,5,App is super easy! Removing and adding alerts finding the right flight for the right price. It's perfect.,,,
2016,5,"Very helpful and worry -free. A real planner, searches out the most cheapest flight accurately.",,,
2016,4,"Like the per country origin and ""anywhere"" destination possibilities. It would be great if one could specify a list of places, e.g. comma separated.",,,
2016,5,Easy to use. I've booked 2 international flights using this app. Just great.,,,
2016,4,why there's NO cebu pacific plane flights? Only PAL and air asia. please answer me,,,
2016,3,The app does not allow user to scan for multiple cities booking. It will be perfect if it comes with this function,,,
2016,5,"To obtain and monitor price changes among the airline companies, it is a magnicifent app. Highly recommended and appreciated!",,,
2016,4,"The app is great,  easy to use and true.  I did a side by side check on airline website and the prices are the same.",,,
2016,5,"If I wanna book or search for a flight a year and a half from now, this app not foresee that far...if only they could extend their reach to 2years from now that would be awesome...anyways you deserve the fifth star so, no worries...",,,
2016,1,I bought  airline tickets online many times and after taking money cancel my ticket.  It's so bad program for booking,,,
2016,5,Awesome app! Booked a couple flights using this app and got great deals!,,,
2016,1,Please revert to the old version of the app. The new one is a step backwards.,,,
2016,5,Pretty simple and lots of results. Installed lots of apps but ended up checking this daily when looking for flights.,,,
2016,5,Simple and effective. Makes booking flights super easy!,,,
2016,4,Very useful and quite friendly user appk. Tqvm to the developer.,,,
2016,5,Best flight app I've used. Prices as good as competition apps.,,,
2016,5,Last updates add very nice options and specification. Well done,,,
2016,5,This app is really great. Just tried the flight section and its simple,,,
2016,4,You can easily compare the prices and choose your flight,,,
2016,4,"Good app but need some improvement add more airlines like AirBlue,Shaheen Air operating in pakistan.",,,
2016,5,I use this app to find and compare flights.  I think it is useful and easy to a apply.,,,
2016,5,It's a very helpful tool when looking for the best price to fly!,,,
2016,4,Excellent app but if you go directly to the actual  airline website it would be cheaper. Sometimes up to 100 ‚Ç¨.,,,
2016,5,It gives you the cheapest flight details on the go. Love it.,,,
2016,2,I'm used an interface where I choose multiple airports near London in one go but it only allowed me to choose one,,,
2016,5,"Love the filter options, great to be able to cut the flights down to just the times/airlines your looking for, 5 stars.",,,
2016,1,"I searched for a particular date, and when I was connected to the airline it showed the flight for ONE MONTH LATER.",,,
2016,4,"I find it OK, no problems yet, and I'm saving money, as i said, does the job. Well done.",,,
2016,4,This is the only app I know that will let me search flights to anywhere . It's good,,,

2016,5,Ajuda muuuito pra comprar a passagem na melhor hora. S√≥ ter paci√™ncia!,,,
2016,1,"It was a great app before the update, which deserves 5/5. But the update has taken away what was working perfectly fine! It's confusing to use now and it doesn't give me the information that i need. Probably i should try the web version as other recommended. But no more app... i'm going to uninstall it.",,,
2016,1,"The new app is useless, I have always used Skyscanner regularly, probably once a week on my phone. Now I prefer to wait until I'm on a computer as I don't find it user friendly and struggle to search for the flights I want. On my s6 I am not able to enter an entire country, use nearby airports or search for flights to 'everywhere'.",,,
2016,1,very slow updating the widgets. sometimes it takes forever. i have fast net connection but its like dialup for fetching price updates etc.... when you touch to refresh the widget on home screen there is a 3 second delay till anything happens. then it takes a while to fetch the updated prices.,,,
2016,1,"The new update is simply dreadful. I don't understand why people can't just leave things that work be. Don't download the app, just use the website because I've never wanted to undownload something more than the new Skyscanner app. It is so confusing. Not as easy as it used to be. And shouldn't be in a legitimate app store.",,,
2016,5,"I have used the website before, but the app is brilliant. It easily points out the cheapest flights by day and month and I booked some very cheap flights because of this information. The app does crash a lot on my galaxy tab 3 8"" and I have sent the reports so hopefully this will improve. However, the app is so good that it gets 5 stars despite the crashes.",,,
2016,1,"Want to check times of return flights - doesn't work. Want to find a return flight - cannot type the name, sorts by price, what's the point of that, takes ages then cannot find the location. Sorry but app sucks.",,,
2016,5,"I've used this app in various countries & it is way better than kayak & expedia. It definitely came in handy when I needed plane tickets at the last minute. I missed a flight & had a flight get canceled, this app was very clutch in both situations!",,,
2016,2,"This app it good but on alert i don't have flexibility such as I want to know total price depart n return and option/extra detail if add luggage,food bcoz it common ppl want too .. It good u give depart and return on alert but I wish flexible option to choose my own time n price showing if different option I choose...",,,
2016,2,"I've used skyscanner for quite some time and it was always good,but lately it seems the prices that get found are not the same as when your transfered to buy your ticket which is very very annoying. I think I'll try a new search service for a while .",,,
2016,1,"Before the recent update, Skyscanner used to be my go to app for searching flights but the recent update has taken it backwards by leap and bounds. It's now over complicated and a pain to use.....",,,
2016,1,Developers and testers probably smoked too much w**d during the project of this useless new version. Simply unbelievable. 27/07 Decided to uninstall it,,,
2016,1,"1st page 477 price . Go to the booking section , jumps to 531 .head to the webite to pay jumps again to 637. Almost 200 usd jump in 30 secs . That my friend is a lie.",,,
2016,2,The app doesn't permit multi stopovers  (the website does) and there is no option on website or app to be flexible wit dates to reduce price fares. If the app could do both of these things five stars all the way!,,,
2016,1,"I always used the website,  thus time I used the app it is crazy,  not flexible at all. It should be much easier to choose one way or two way. Also the app chose the origin itself,  so stupid app.",,,
2016,5,"I'm very happy that I've found this AMAZING apps. It's very convenient for you to search the flights using this apps, especially if you're trying to save your budget. THANK YOUüòäüòò",,,

2016,1,"Have never seen an app ruined to this extent by a single update. It was 5/5 before, now I don't feel it deserves 1/5, and no, I'm not exaggerating.",,,
2016,5,Very helpful to track flights. Maybe live updates on the flight could be introduced as well. But then it might take touch memory :),,,
2016,5,Used this for over 20 flights now. Always a great price and easy to use. Never have any problems with the app on android. Happy days.,,,
2016,1,"Much more limited for browsing destinations, which gets rid of everything I liked about this app. Why do app makers always make ""various upgrades and bug fixes"" that seriously decrease the utility of their apps? Uninstall",,,
2016,1,"Loved the old version, but this is nowhere near as good. Can't understand why you would change an app that everyone likes.",,,
2016,5,really good and informative apps! easy to compare ticket prices and got the best rate available. will use it everytime!,,,
2016,5,"Like it a lot. The app is very useful, I booked some flight using it and it was a great deal. Five stars for overall.",,,
2016,1,This used to be the most flexible & informative app. Now the results come in an useless pile of randomness. Yes 5/5 down to 1/5 in one update!!?,,,
2016,5,It is easy to use and it has given great prices.  The price alert function has been great too. Would definitely recommend it.,,,
2016,5,I'd love to be able to see the history of the pricing fluctuation of the flights I'm currently following. Be nice to see for a future reference when the cheapest time was to buy the ticket,,,
2016,1,"Why,  when i price flights, is there over $100 difference on my phone app compared to my fianc√®'s phone app?? Seems dodgy",,,
2016,5,Great app to search cheap flights to any destination. User-friendly and so easy to handle compared to other apps.,,,
2016,1,"Hate the update on the app, why do companies update their apps and make them worse!! Go back to the old version",,,
2016,3,Its decent app. Only concern is when you check few times prices start to shoot up within minutes,,,
2016,5,Great app! Saves alot of time searching. I wish the hotels app works too!,,,
2016,4,Hard to find info on quantas plus wheelchair friendly providers re weight wheelchair also discounts. Food diabetic,,,
2016,5,Each & every information related with flights just one click away. I was desparately searching for this kind of applications for long.,,,
2016,5,It is so useful and efficient. I can  shorten my time on searching flights. I like to travel on last minute.,,,

2016,5,It lets you compare prices from across all service providers ....nice app...well done team.,,,

2016,5,So helpful! Especially the things to know. Simplifies international travel!,,,
2016,5,Has better features than other apps such as seeing entire month and checking off direct flight option from initial search screen.,,,
2016,1,"The old app was so simple to use, but this one is rather confusing and dosen't allow for the same scope of searches, etc.  Better just using the website.",,,
2016,5,I always check flight options via Skyscanner and it give me great deals and options that is not offered by similar sites.,,,
2016,4,Doesn't offer multiple city airport. Otherwise works without issue.,,,
2016,5,"App is convenient, gives you option of cheapest dates. And also, prices for all airlines starting with cheapest",,,
2016,5,Thinks of every detail to help find the perfect and cheapest flight. Love it!,,,
2016,5,"Nice, easy, up to date consistent flights identified. Good stuff",,,

2016,1,I still found better deals on the airline webpage..and saving much more money.,,,
2016,4,Very good flight finder except if you want to go in a country that is not very known such as French Guiana,,,
2016,3,App was amazing until they upgraded it and now everything is hard to use and doesn't work.,,,
2016,1,If it ain't broke don't fix it.  And u guys tried and ruined it,,,

2016,4,All my vacay planning starts from this little guy...,,,
2016,5,Very Informative Useful Best in comparison of Fares,,,
2016,4,"I always compare flights and fares before actually deciding which airline to use. Once decided I crosscheck with the actual airline website. It checks all the availble airlines & saves time. Wonderful application, very useful & my favourite.",,,
2016,4,"I have only browsed through the app and it's not bad, a bit confusing at times but I have an issue with the fact that it doesn't have my currency as an option, Trinidad and Tobago has their own currency so I'd rather not get the prices in US dollars which is very misleading and I don't have that problem on the web version.",,,
2016,3,"The app seems to work fine for me. But it kept a service running in the background, which hogged about 30MB of RAM. I'm uninstalling since I don't want it slowing down my phone while I'm not even using the app.",,,
2016,1,Me informe acerca de las agencias de Viajes que aparecen en esta app y por lo que pude encontrar el riesgo es bastante alto de perder tu dinero o parcialmente. Ejemplo busquen en la web comentarios de la agencia Travel2be y se dar√°n cuenta que muchas personas han sido estafadas hasta existe un grupo de Facebook para denunciar.,,,
2016,5,"Easy to use, fast and reliable. Saves time. Great Job team",,,
2017,5,Love this app use only of reservation my flights 5 times a year never have problems with it is amazing and can't live without,,,
2017,5,Save lots of time to plan trips according availability of tickets,,,
2016,1,"As lots of other users have already said, this app update has completely ruined what previously was a fantastic piece of software. The new design is totally confusing, it's arbitrary whether a search let's you specify 'whole month' or not when searching, the screens are now crowded with information and it is now slower than the old version. So wish I hadn't pressed the update button. Keep hold of the old style app for as long as you can!",,,
2016,3,"The idea of searching for flights to anywhere based on the date and vice versa is amazing, except that the prices shown are never the actual prices on the airline website. Sometimes they don't even have the flight which was listed on the app, so I'm uninstalling it because it's no use having an app which you can't trust. I really hope they work on it to make it more reliable soon, then I'll certainly download it again.",,,
2016,1,"I absolutely hate this new version. So much harder to navigate to find the cheapest prices. I used to depend on this app to book all my flights, and loved the simplicity of it. Less is more guys, and if it aint  broke - no need to fix it! Please please bring back the old app!!",,,
2016,1,"Functionality of skyscanner was great, ease of use to explore different flight options, switching destination and origin, assess prices.. Now there is extra steps to it all. Having to back and forth.. Even visually not as good. Awkward and not very useful new features",,,
2016,1,"Before the last update, this app was amazing, loved it, fast and easy. After the last update there's a new user interface that misses all logic, the departure airport disappears while entering the rest of the search, filters dont work any longer, and finding the right flights was made impossible. HOW DO I GET THE OLD APP BACK?",,,
2016,1,"Bring back the old version! The new UI is not very user-friendly. If still available, I can't figure out how to reverse flight directions or easily filter. I think the new version has clearly substituted style for substance and failed miserably.",,,
2016,1,"I used to love skyscanner until the new update, you focused too much on graphics but now its not user friendly. Difficult to navigate. And the bars all look the same. I cant tell which one is cheaper.",,,
2016,4,Thumbs up for easy to use interface and including all possible sources for flight rates. Makes it really easy to chose between various options. Also a great feature is the price alerts. In all a very handy app for travellers.,,,
2016,1,"The new version of app is clunky, frustrating and non intuitive.  The old one was perfect. Now you have to click loads of places to get same result",,,
2016,3,"Rated 4 stars previously. A great app but in the latest update there are issues with the filters. Not major but means that you have to scan through the flights, taking more time.",,,
2016,1,"My previous review showed this app was the best in town, low spam, low ram usage, easy to use UI now it's gone as useless as every other spam app on the market. Uninstalling!",,,
2016,1,When you develop something crappy you should admit and not look like an idiot.  That's what I have to say to the Skyscanner team. This new version is simply a disaster!,,,
2016,5,3 day's use so far and no problems.  it had a great feature that allows you to scan per country and month and average price.  love this app,,,
2016,1,It was easy to navigate in the older version. This new version is difficult to use and is not mobile friendly. Sorry developers but I did not like this new version of the app. Right now I am looking for another app which looked liked your older version of the app.The older version was simpler. This new version is very complicated.,,,
2016,5,"If you love traveling and are always searching for a great deal on flights, this app is very easy to use and extremely helpful when trying to compare prices and places to travel. Definitely one of the top apps for finding and comparing flight deals with trip dates",,,
2016,1,This new update is less intuitive and not very mobile friendly. Loved previous version and this new one is much more difficult for something as simple as searching for flights,,,
2016,5,This is seriously the best thing since sliced bread. So easy to use and save you so much money on flights! Wowza is how I would explain it.,,,
2016,3,"What has happened to you guys?? Even the app was more simple before this new design, it was more useful. I really miss to option to watch all the of the availables flights for an specific date.",,,
2016,1,you really broke the search & why the heck is it called Flights in my phone - I'm used to look for Skyscanner (you could add the option in the settings)  I'm going to search for tickets on the web as the search in the app is so bad now,,,
2016,5,I wish I would had had this app sooner. I travel a lot and now it is much easier for me to check on the best Deals and when I want to fly. GET THIS APP !,,,
2016,5,I've been using this app for 3 years and I always come here first. I find the best flights up here without searching multiple websites.,,,
2016,1,"Old version was amazing, this is pants ,so difficult to navigate around, old version was very simple and user friendly , why fix something if it isn't broken, bring old version back please",,,
2016,5,"I've compared this to all the low air fare sites and none beat this! Maybe the same,  but  I don't have to visit 10 different websites for the same results! I love this app.",,,
2016,3,"Fastest way so far to check one cheapest flights. However, no mulit-destination option available.",,,
2016,4,"This app was brilliant,  but succesive updates have ruined it.  If it's not broken,  don't fix it",,,
2016,1,So much harder to find cheaper fares now. Used to recommend this app all the time. No longer will,,,
2016,5,Great app...so easy to watch and favorite flights. My new fav tool for flying!,,,
2016,5,"Shows what i need, within a short time. Using the help of the filters makes it more better.Thank you",,,
2016,5,"Coupled with a really simple and user friendly website and app, this no frills attached service is easily the best in class.",,,
2016,1,I downloaded this app. Price is very high compared to flight official website. Totally disappointed,,,
2016,5,I use it all the time and it works well.  I wish it could do multi-city or stop overs.,,,
2016,5,THE fastest easiest way to find flights/prices anywhere. Brilliant!,,,
2016,3,"Number of passengers in different alerts can't have different number of passengers.when I change number of passengers in one search alert, it automatically changes the number of passengers in all other alerts. I don't want this.",,,
2016,3,Filters do not work on this new version. Can you fix please?,,,
2016,4,On desktop version you can choose multi stops but not this app.   When will this function be added to the app,,,
2016,5,Everyone can use this app...its only shown real ticket fare and flight departure... I love it,,,
2016,3,Don't like the new update.  But the old format was soo much better,,,
2016,5,Just now I can compare so many flights price. 4 thumb up,,,
2016,5,Awesome job guys. Perfect is the word I have for you all. Extremely easy to use and searches entire database to provide best result.,,,
2016,5,Loved how the dates show the prices when selecting dates for flights. Easy to use!,,,
2016,1,Whole month/ whole year feature no longer works properly. :(,,,
2016,4,Realy easy to use. Clearly scans the sky. Thumbs up!!,,,
2016,2,Why filter doesn't work??? For me it's so important be able to check flight time,,,
2016,2,Why no Cebu Pacific flights in the Philippines? Awful omissions.,,,
2016,3,Es una actualizacion pero no una mejora. Tal vez sea cosa de costumbre pero me resulta mucho mas complicada que la anterior,,,
2016,5,Very useful. Comparison shopping in one spot! Easy to use and read.,,,
2016,5,Look up flights per month and see the cheapest at your fingertips. Love it!,,,
2016,5,Great way of booking flights. Now super fast too...,,,
2016,1,Useless. Cant even find a flight for dates inputed. Back to my desktop,,,
2016,5,Easy and can see what you want at a glance. Book all flights thru SKYSCANNER,,,
2016,1,No more graph which was a major plus for this app. Hard to search multiple dates now and much more complicated as a whole.,,,
2016,5,Very cool I like it makes easy to find the cheapest flight thanks sky scanner,,,
2016,5,Skyscanner is so simple to use and it is easy to find flights!  Love it!,,,
2016,4,Helps to get a target range of prices weeks before your flight.,,,
2016,4,"Love this app, it's so easy to use and it keeps all your history which makes repeat trips simple to search for.",,,
2016,2,This app needs the multi-city functionality like the full website does. Please provide the multi-city option!,,,
2016,1,You guys took a great app and ruined it. I'll have to go back to Kayak now.,,,
2016,4,"Can search only with Wi-Fi on. With a normal network connection the message ""Need an internet connection"" always appears.",,,
2016,1,"I m pretty sure that a lot of people don't like the new update, me included, this is just terrible update,",,,
2016,5,It shows you the change of prices between months. üñíüñíüñí,,,
2016,2,Filters that allow you to adjust flight windows do not work on HTC One M8,,,
2016,5,Best traveling app ever!!!! Prices are always cheaper,,,
2016,1,New update is really disappointing...can't work with this app anymore :(,,,
2016,4,Don't expect to change anything about your flight because it will cost more than your initial ticket.,,,
2016,5,"Very useful, thought through from a user's perspective. Love the filter functions such as departure after a certain time.",,,
2016,1,They have now totally changed this app...its now a nightmare to search!!,,,
2016,5,This app saved us so much money while traveling in Europe for 3 years. I recommend it to everyone now!,,,
2016,4,Good app but it's missing Multi City option which exists on the Web.,,,
2016,5,Easy to use. I have used them all and this is the best..,,,
2016,4,Please add a search option which enables the user to search through whole Europe,,,
2016,3,I can't find the multistop option in the mobile version.,,,
2016,5,"Simple, accurate and easy to use. Nothing else I could ask.",,,
2016,5,he can show you every trip and you can shoose the cheapest one....so lovely app,,,
2016,5,Easy to use & understand & gives a good selection of prices & places.,,,
2016,5,Great app. Should also include local airlines in the search.,,,
2016,5,This is by far the best app ive came across for flight pricing !,,,

2016,5,"I use the hopper app but I like this one better, it has more accurate information and has more options",,,
2016,5,"This is app is awesome because is easy to use, intuitive, elegant.",,,

2016,5,Help you to find out airlines with a cheapest price.,,,
2016,5,Cheapest flights I found for 5 people and at the right times,,,
2016,5,Absolutely awesome app! Big thumbs up to the developers of this amazing app!!!!,,,
2016,5,Banyak pilihan penerbangan dan tidak terlalu rumit peng aplikasian nya,,,
2016,5,Im not getting anything to push to book a flight please help,,,
2016,1,"The unique thing about sky scanner used to be that it would show great deals to various locations, so for instance if you want to tour Europe but don't care where you fly in and it of you can save hundreds by setting that one city happens to be way cheaper at that time.  I'm Uninstalling, it's worthless. Then they told me the everywhere function is under top deals,  but it's not.  And they got rid of the multi month calendar where you could look and see what days were cheaper to travel",,,
2016,4,I have had the older version of this app for ages and was my favourite  for booking flights and searching . Was a bit shocked how much you changed it in the update.  But I just started playing with it then and I'm  getting used to it . I think it's just so different  from before regular uses get a bit shocked I can see what your trying to do and I think a bit more use I will love it:),,,
2016,1,"Terrible user interface, impossible to search normally. F this thing. Use kayak or literally any other app. Their website is fine. This is terrible. The developers should be hung and quartered.",,,
2016,1,"This app is just useless. When searching for a flight you're sent round in circles, back to the same annoying calendar pages to select direct flights that it says exist but sends you on a three stop round the world tour once you try to select",,,
2016,4,I find this app super handy at finding me the best flight deal for domestic and international travel. Not 5 stars yet becuase it likes going blank on me!,,,
2016,5,This is my go to app for flights. Hands down these are the lowest prices that can be found. I even recommend this app to my customers as a travel agent!,,,
2016,4,Best tool for finding flights. Would be 5star if you could search destinations and get best carriers for a season (not exact dates),,,
2016,5,"Fantastic app, always gives the best prices available, have been able to travel to countries I never thought I'd visit! Thanks!",,,
2016,5,"When tested against actual flight operators the results are the same, therefore providing a good central source comparison. Nice one.",,,
2016,5,Love the easy to use filters in order to narrow down what you are really looking for in a flight. This is my go to App for any type of travel plans.,,,
2016,5,nice useful app. we find correct price and so easy. I love it,,,
2016,5,Heard about this app through my travel travel group. It's great finding deals on international aswell as domestic flights.,,,
2016,4,"Still seems to have trouble including / considering Jetstar flights from Townsville to Bali, moreso seems to miss Air Asia Bali to Bangkok domestic terminal, otherwise seems great.",,,
2016,4,With simple selection of your traveling date you will get bunch of list from different airlines will flying if date selected. Awesome..***,,,
2016,5,I love the calender being color coded to show what days are cheaper. this is the first app I look at when planning a trip,,,
2016,1,After new updates very bad and at all useful. I uninstalled the application.,,,
2016,5,So easy and convenient to book the best prices!  Love this App.,,,
2016,1,I always encounter the network error! I can't even access the website.,,,
2016,4,All good except I would be better if we could do multi-city searches as well.,,,
2016,4,Don't get me wrong the app is working good but need to improve the search and the selection of the flight option,,,
2016,4,Love all the functions and that it watches potential itineraries for me. Need multi-city function tho.,,,
2016,4,This app is good. Although I don't like the new search bar.,,,
2016,1,As soon as you select a departure date all of the available return flights disappear from view,,,
2016,4,"So far so good,we will see if I catch a great deal to make it 5 stars",,,
2016,3,If you want a quick and easy to use reference for prices this is ok,,,
2016,4,"Add an option where i can set a price range for a ticket,  and be notified if avaliable .",,,
2016,4,Great app for comparison of flight costs and times and a graphical view of when cheapest months are,,,
2016,5,"Really helpful app, fast and effective...... Great work guys :)",,,
2016,5,Has everything you need  in order to find the best solution!,,,
2016,5,"I have been using this app for over two years, I  highly recommend it.",,,
2016,5,Great app so easy to use easy online purchase have had no problems,,,
2016,5,The best flight search app with the most options for filtering the results.,,,
2016,5,"This is  the easiest to search and it remembers, making it simple to watch a fare.",,,
2016,5,Used to think Priceline was the best. This site is just as good.,,,

2016,4,Why there is no multiple destination like the website?,,,
2016,1,"Just downloaded app, it won't let me add departure location, back to Google flights.",,,
2016,1,"The search process in the app is terrible. First you cannot choose to search one way flights on the initial screen. For that you have to get to the default anytime field on the second screen and after clicking there, unchoose the return option. So the initial price info is only valid for return flights even if you do not want them. These are two useless steps to choose a one way flight. I have not figurred out how I can choose different airports for my flight legs. Probably I cannot :(",,,
2016,1,"What the hell has happened to this app!!! The old version was brilliant. This new version is rubbish. So easy to check the lowest price flights on the old version, this keeps coming back as nothing found. Gets itself in a mess over outward and return dates and is definitely not as user friendly as the old one! The update also managed to remove the shortcut from my screen. Hopeless. Please go back to the old version or I too will find another flight app. How can you mess up an excellent app so badly! üò†",,,
2016,1,"I've gotten a new phone and downloaded this app which I used to love using, but I guess there have been updates which make it similar to any other... what happened to the chart showing prices by date??  There is never any data when I try to use it.  That was the whole benefit of using skyscanner, to choose dates based on price. Now this seems useless.  Bummed!!",,,
2016,1,"The old app was intuitive easy to use and did the job perfect. New interface is hard to use non intuitive and just basically hard to use. Update.  Previously you put in the flight requirements on on page, searched and all the possible airports appeared in a very concise manner.You then drilled down for further info.The new app puts too much info on the search return page and as such looks cluttered and its hard to use and navigate. It tries to do too much. Less is more in this case.",,,
2016,1,Used to be good. Not anymore. Unable to search by month to pick best flight. It just says no data. Even link you gave me to contact you wont open and cant be copied. Used to be so easy to use. Now has me searching for alternative. Please post alternative  with your complaint everyone if you find something like skyscanner used to be.,,,
2016,4,This is a good app. Easy to pick and select your flights and navigate the filters. Only one thing missing. A Multi flight option. What if I want to do a few day stop over in a no ther city while on my way somewhere else? I can't find an easy way to do this other than select individual flights and try to remember where I am. Please add a multi flight option!!,,,
2016,3,I wanna book my flight here coz i found the cheapest flight in my route. But my friend told me not to trust in you coz she booked a flight and she's waiting for confirmation email but then you didnt update her and you get the cost of the air fare in her bank account and she tried to call the airline to confirm but you didnt book it coz the airline told her no flight booked with her name. Please I want you to help me please. I just need to booked my flight. And,,,
2016,1,I thought i was gonna find cheaper prices downloading these apps.Not understanding the need for these apps cause all the ones ive downloaded were more expensive than what i found searching online. You just got to know where to search. Im deleting all these apps that's taking up space!!,,,
2016,2,"I don't know how this passed QC/QA. I like that you tried to innovate and make things easier, but you didn't! The UI has some usability problems (mistapping is the major) and functionally speaking, searching for a flight is very hard because after the first search I need to redo the search again because the screen doesn't react anymore (the app is responding, but there is no output for the actions).",,,
2016,3,Sky scanner is an amazing app although after the update you can't select more than one destination without having to start again. It also defaults an anytime default setting to a week in May and won't let you change it unless you go through the main screen and do it all again? Hope this can be fixed (or old version reinstated) quickly as this is one of my favorite apps and I'm not liking this new time consuming version. üòî,,,
2016,3,Great format but find selection a location in the everywhere choice only works on my first 'click'. I have to reload the page by going back to see the different options for that destination. Slightly annoying. Will stick to the website for now,,,
2016,1,"This app used to be amazing, since the update it is very difficult to use. Clumsy to navigate and search for flights. Becoming increasingly frustrating with every use. I gave up and now visit the airline native apps to search.",,,
2016,3,"I'm so disappointed that they have upgraded this app from what was previously a fantastic easy to use app. Now it's complicated & unreliable. i.e. If you want to search from a base to a flexible destination once you have chosen that destination you can't go back a step and choose another. I am so frustrated that they had to totally transform such a wonderful app. Also pictures of the destinations, what's the point!",,,
2016,1,"Not what I need.  No real time flight tracking where there are actual airplane icons that can be seen zooming across the sky so you can tell where a plane your family is on, may be at any one time.",,,
2016,2,"I tried to book a flight through SkyScanner and everything seemed to be going well. That is, until I discovered that the lists are bloated with Canadian carriers which charge in CAD instead of USD. Foreign carriers should be indicated by the app so I can exclude them.",,,
2016,2,"Whenever I choose to fly 'Everywhere', results wil display accordingly. Then I select Country X, decided to go back to the results of Flying to Everywhere and select Country Y, I will remain in the same screen. It is very annoying and cumbersome as I have to restart from beginning.",,,
2016,5,You can select a wide range of currencies. It searches across all airlines and lists the price for each.  Convenient for comparing prices and getting an idea of when the tickets are cheap or expensive. I recommend using it.makes things that much easier,,,
2016,1,"What have you guys done with such an useful app? Now it's next to useless, hard to navigate, slow, not intuitive at all! Why changing something so neat and nicely done just in the sake of having an update?",,,
2016,5,"Easy, convinient, Good Bye to the times of spending countless hours thru different websites of travel servers and airlines, check it out, maybe like me you will find a great price to some beautiful place that you didn't know about",,,
2016,1,I checked to a common destination where I using other services gets lots of direct flights on this one I got NO DIRECT FLIGHTS and lots of hits from one airline going through various hubs. I think they sell results.,,,
2018,1,"This app used to be good but it's recently changed and it is now super unintuitive, slow, and only showed 3 flights when I searched for ""Everywhere"". Looking elsewhere.",,,
2016,1,Why has this app gone from simple to use to I can no longer use. It's overly complex and has me trying to find an alternative app for ease of use. Even the widget is inferior to the previous version,,,
2016,1,I had the old app. It was great. This update is so counterintuitive.  No multiple windows! ? No one-way option to start...,,,
2016,4,"In Europe its gives amazingly good deals,  but in Asia the cheapest prices it shows aren't exactly the cheapest ones.  Its missing few airlines or sites in Asia.  I couldn't see air asia which is like the cheapest asian airlines in the app",,,
2016,5,Great resource.  I use it all the time to get the cheapest flights on some of my favorite Airlines.  I can't believe it's free!,,,
2016,5,"This is the best flight app ever!  Simple to use and great prices on flights, couldn't be improved!  Well done to the developers...",,,
2016,1,I love your website and thought your app would be great but it's awful! It is impossible to find return flights that are useful as the sorting is nonsensical.,,,
2016,5,"Very useful app, especially when your travel parameters are flexible. Would love to see the multi-city option added to the app please, like on the website.",,,
2016,1,Used to be top class go to for all my flights now it's awful.  Very time consuming to search different flights I will not be using again in its changed format why change what isn't broke you went from a great app to poor difficult to use one why ?,,,
2016,4,The app works fine and it's easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that it has to skip over to the browser for the booking process,,,
2016,5,"Thanks a lot for the app, saved me a lot of money... Could you guys add a option to see from which country is it cheaper to buy?",,,
2016,2,The pricing is good letting you know what dates are cheaper. Why can I not do multi city trips I can only do return or one way.,,,
2016,3,"There is no multi city option in the mobile app,only available in the desktop version. Can u fix this?",,,
2016,4,"So glad I found this app, but would love to be able to a multiple city flight and see a total price of my saved flights",,,
2016,4,When searching if you try to go back... It lets you but then you can not select any options to go forward again. Have to restart app. Samsung S7 edge,,,
2016,4,Good app displays cheap flights and all options. Just wish it did multicity trips like the website.,,,
2016,5,Best way of checking the right flight. Happy with it. Works very well.,,,
2016,5,I actually did not expect it would have so many capabilities! Easy to use and works smoothly.,,,
2016,5,"With the ability to set price alerts, leave dates AND destinations open when searching for flights, this app is hands down the best flighr app i have used",,,
2016,5,"Worth the downlaod, very mobile friendly and smooth user interface. Great job SkyScanner.",,,
2016,4,This app is great! I love that it even includes Southwest flights in it's searches.,,,

2016,5,"Always get the best deal and loads of diffrent flights, amazing",,,

2016,5,"When my friend first told me about this App I was sceptical, but I find it SO easy and helpful to use. Glad I got the App.",,,
2016,4,Although the application is good but the new interface is complex to use.,,,
2016,1,They dumbed down the app and made it useless better off with kayak now,,,
2016,5,"Great app, great site! Absolute cheapest fares of all the discount sites.",,,
2016,4,The best app to view the different fares and very user friendly.,,,
2016,5,I have been using this app for years. It's the best one out there,,,

2016,1,Really poor update to what was a fully functioning app,,,
2016,1,Seriously need to go back to the drawing board with this app !,,,
2016,5,"Pls insert another operator, rayani air, malindo air, firefly and etc.. Malaysia region.",,,
2016,5,Everything is possible with skyscanner above world because of competition above competition,,,
2016,2,"I'm a frequent long distance flyer and have been using Skyscanner for years now to compare prices of different routes and make bookings. But since the interface revamp, this has become an onerous task. Skyscanner, Please feel free to contact me if you want some feedback on how it can be improved.",,,
2016,3,"I downloaded this based on a recommendation but so far my expectations haven't been fully met. To test this out I searched dates for a flight I just booked and my airline didn't come up at all. I guess Southwest isn't included despite what the current Money magazine article states. Disappointed in that but a similar priced flight did show up for Delta, albeit a different airport in the same city.",,,
2016,5,"This is a great app. It is very easy to find a flight that fits your budget and schedule. You can search specific dates and airports, or choose two general locations and easily see what arrival and departure days are cheapest by the generated bar graph. I love how nice the material design is, which makes navigating through the app fun. And the price alerts are a great tool for knowing the cheapest flights for where you want to go. Plus, no ads. This is my wife's and my favorite flight search app.",,,
2016,2,"Been studying this for a while now and I have to ask, how many incorrect prices do you show??? For 5 days you haven't had the same prices as you get through Cebu Pacific. You state 8000 baht as a group price but can't get the flights any cheaper than 11,600 baht via Cebu. And it's not due to seats, baggage or tax. Just simply the wrong price. Very frustrating!",,,
2016,1,"You used to have the best flight app ever with the old interface I used it almost daily, now you must have spent thousands turning it into one of the worst designed apps ever, it's just so hard to find anything relevant now, its useless searching from my phone, I end up waiting until I'm near my laptop. Does anyone know of a decent flight comparison app so I can delete this one?",,,
2016,2,"Comes with Boingo free WiFi in Dubai, not much good if the connection is bad!!! It is hard to rate your application when it is packaged with a lousy WIfi provider, change your partnerships, or get Dubai Airport to improve their service. Then you may get better ratings?",,,
2016,1,"Revising my rating to 1 star. Two days after I purchased my tickets, the price went down by over 20%. Skyscanner cost me $50 with their low quality app. STAY AWAY!",,,
2016,1,"This app was perfect before they updated it, you could easily find the cheapest price by looking month to month, 1 click for single or return flights, the new version is a joke, I have been using the new version for over one month now and even for someone whose computer savvy it fails on so many levels, I recommended this app to so many people prior to the update, I'm afraid to say I have uninstalled it now.",,,
2016,5,"It's simple, it's fast, it has any sort option you could possibly need and it covers a ton of airlines. Makes shopping for flights so easy, even if just to find the flight you want and shop price on other sites. Great tool for the constant on the go traveler for business",,,
2016,2,"I loved the previous version.1) In the new one you can't go directly watched flights (specific dates) to the graphic prices (no dates). 2) when you open graphic when you can't see prices, you need click on same date to give you the price. Can you give back the last version? Thanks.",,,
2016,5,"After missing a flight,  I was able to pull up my search on Skyscanner and it found me a same day flight for less than the original flight I had missed! I was able to get to the ticket counter and get a new flight with no hassle at all (except missing my flight to begin with). It was the simplest search ever,  even under pressure from rushing and failing to arrive in time! Literally saved my sanity!!!!",,,
2016,2,"Prices shown are from 25 then when u click on it, it is somehow from 55 the cheapest and then u realise its only one way and on the days nobody wants to fly. Am I supposed to spread the w-o-m that this app has the cheapest tickets? Not impressed.",,,
2016,4,"More user-friendly version. Better UI. Hope they retain the dates after a previous search to save more time and not to input the desired dates again. Overall, I am satisfied with this app and recommending it to friends and family.",,,
2016,5,"The Customer  Service is very good too. I am planning to go to RDO-RADOM Airport, Poland  and I couldn't  find any  flights  to this airport using the flight searching apps. I have contacted  Skyscanner  and Jon from the Customer Support actioned this to be added to Skyscanner in no time. I always use that app and with that good customer  services experience  I am more than happy  to recommend it to everyone .",,,
2016,5,"This is the best App that I've found for looking for flights. Anywhere. It's easy to use, give you price ranges when looking up dates so you can pick them according to your price range. It's easy to book. I use it every time! Love it!",,,
2016,5,"Used it to search out all available flights to my desired international destination, select the airline, time and cost I wanted, and was impressed how the purchase linked straight into Expedia. Even more so that the ticket price shown on Skyscanner matched the actual price paid, which I've found is not always the case on other flight search apps.",,,
2016,5,I love the whole month price comparison. It really help you plan your trip. Very user friendly. Nice and easy design. It also has fare alerts. By all means use it!!,,,
2016,5,"I love it but I love it more if u can show like a calendar or prices for a month then it's easier to search for cheapest fares. Anyhoo, I love this that I hope I can give 10 stars. Keep up the good work",,,
2016,1,"But since the new update, the button with the bars disappeared on the top right and now you can't compare the price of the flights around the date anymore.. It was the best feature of this app imo",,,
2016,5,"Finds every possible flight combination for trips you're planning, priced low to high. Let's you easily choose departure/arrival times too. Fantastic app!",,,
2016,2,This app keeps spinning me in circles. I'd really like to give it a chance but I'm frustrated. I select my cities and date and it keeps showing me a calendar to select dates. I can't move past this part. Please help,,,
2016,1,Just booked the flight overseas they wanted a photocopy of my passport and front and back of my credit card hell no! Went back to CheapOair I'll pay more but I'm a whole lot safer,,,
2016,4,"I mainly use this app for the 'search everywhere' function to see what cheap weekend trips I can make. But, I wish this app would tell me the aircraft type as I'm a bit of a plane nerd too.",,,
2016,5,"So simple to use! Very user friendly, I love the fact it saves airports. I have yet to book a ticket but I hope that goes well also.",,,
2016,2,"My main issues with this App are that it's called 'Flights' rather than 'Skyscanner' and that it keeps sending spam push notifications with no way to turn them off. The name makes it tricky to find the app when they're arranged alphabetically, and I don't want a daily push notification asking me if I want to book the flights I browsed last week.",,,
2016,5,"Need little improvement as there is no option available to search flights for multi destinations.. like I want to travel from point A to B, B to C and finally C to A. But no search option available. If u can kindly introduce this feature. Regards",,,
2016,1,Just cannot make head nor tail of the new interface.  Just want to see the cheapest days for a whole month from UK airports.  Just can't work it out.,,,
2016,4,I've used this app many times to make bookings. It choses the cheapest fare or stay possible almost every time. I would recommend it's use in conjunction with other apps as a check.No bugs so far.,,,
2016,3,Used to be a good app.  Doesn't give the results in list like before.  Always says no data available. Searching for dates 3 months from now,,,
2016,1,"Update is a load a crap, can't even check one one flights, only let's you search a return journey..what's that about??? Old version was much better and easier.",,,
2016,5,"I really like this app as it has option of ""everywhere"" and ""anytime."" I have different apps like this but this one is my favorite. Lots of great deals!",,,
2016,5,This is the only review I've ever left on the market store. This is the best app ever for booking flights. I've used this app for the past 5 years and it's gotten me the best deals,,,
2016,2,Maybe I'm missing something but I dislike checking for the price of a flight and then having to go out to search for the price. It's just not as good as it used to be.,,,
2016,5,"Works great, it's better than the website. One improvement recommendation would be adding an option for low-cost airlines.",,,
2016,4,Really nifty. Love the price alerts and flight ratings depending on length and price. Would add dates to layovers to avoid confusion,,,
2016,5,I love this app. The alerts make it easy to know when the price goes up or down so you can purchase. Good job on this app.,,,
2016,5,Looking for tickets to Cannabis Cup last minute.  Was looking at $900 for rountrip tickets from the East to West Coast .  Skys ticket prices we're less than have of other sites!!!!,,,
2016,5,"If this had a multi-city function, that would be fantastic. For example, I'm flying out of my home airport, visiting 2 different countries, then returning back to my home airport. This function would be helpful in determining pricing and timing for visiting those 2 other countries.",,,
2016,2,Where has the option to search an entire month gone? This was the most useful feature. The website still allows you to do this.,,,
2016,5,Accurate pricing results that is synchronized with the cost found on the websites the app is retrieving information from and it facilitates transferring to the travel agent/ airline website to complete the selected trip transaction.,,,
2016,1,Don't use this thing to book a bus ticket (redbus).. Nither you will get a ticket or a refund.. Soo much angry..üí©,,,
2016,5,Best app to find cheap flights! I'm so glad there is an app like this in the world! I hope to start traveling soon,,,
2016,1,Please go back to previous app version. Can't even click through to book with airlines and horrible new layout.,,,
2016,5,In other words I searched flights from London to verona in September the cheapest flight Skyscanner could find was ¬£240 and 7.5 hours with 1 stop.went on a well renowned UK travel websites that found 4.5h flights for ¬£200,,,
2016,3,Gave old version 5stars this one 3 as when I click flights from bar graph and then done button  it takes me away from flight not to flight times and to booking have to then search again with specific dates,,,
2016,4,Good apps.. Easy information. But please in the future give more option from the other airlines..,,,
2016,3,"Pretty minimal interface but please name it Skyscanner not ""Flights"". Also a way of clearing individual searches.",,,
2016,5,"One of the best app for air traveller!! Made life easier, gives yu all the information about the air schedule keeping it economical!!",,,
2016,5,"Liking the app. Going to compare it to others to verify prices are best, but it's easy to use",,,
2016,1,They have ruined this app with the new update. The old set up was far easier amd quicker,,,
2016,5,I am loving this app so far.  I have yet to make a purchase but when I do I will update my review.,,,
2016,4,Nice app and claims no booking fee but gives a little bit more expensive options than other apps like cheap flights.,,,
2016,4,"Keep adding more providers, would be good experience if purchase of ticket is integrated in Skyscanner from any or available providers instead of redirect to third party website.",,,
2016,5,"I almost open this app on a daily basis. User interface, flight details, price are the key features, which makes this app best..!!!!",,,
2016,3,"Bookings does not clearly state baggage allowance, how do we know if we're only allowed hand luggage or 20kg or 30kg ??",,,
2016,3,I used this app all the time before. The new look takes a bit of getting used to. It was brilliant.,,,
2016,5,Great app!! If you could have multiple flights as well would be brilliant,,,
2016,5,Very simple app that finds best prices. Easy to change search criteria.,,,
2016,5,Love this app! Always cheaper prices than other flight apps!,,,

2016,4,"Very good, for finding flights for the lowest prices!",,,
2016,5,This app is good for looking at a variety of flight combinations and prices and it works quickly :),,,
2016,5,I always get the cheapest air line prices using skyscanner. I depend on this website.,,,
2016,3,Needs multicity and return options. Will have to uninstall app and use website instead as not enough flexibility with the app.,,,
2016,5,Couldn't be easier to use! Nice graphics and performance! Keep up the good work team! :),,,
2016,5,Easy to book flight and compare the prices between all available airline companies.,,,
2016,5,Love it so much... New experience for app.. Very nice,,,
2016,3,The experience is nowhere near as intuitive as the last. Huge fan of SS and happy to bump to 5* when changes are made,,,
2016,2,"New app is terrible. Old one was perfect, if it's not broke don't fix it.",,,
2016,1,The app does not correctly interpret exchange rates. I was charged way more than listed.,,,
2016,5,Thanks for the best lowest price flights app in the world.,,,
2016,5,"This app has saved me, my family, and friends an exorbitant amount of money. Highly recommended for anyone who spends their money wisely",,,
2016,5,The cheapest days information is invaluable! Cheapest tickets anywhere!,,,
2016,5,I absolutely loved the way you've done the rate popup in it. One of the few apps I wanted to rate because of it.,,,
2016,5,"I use it all the time- everyday! But, I don't Like the updated format!",,,
2016,1,Can't find how to search everywhere by setting dates without choosing the location first anymore!?,,,
2016,4,Wotks just like the website and very quick in results...,,,
2016,3,This app is the best so far regarding travel plans.,,,
2016,5,Perfect for booking quick get-aways. Amazed at the saving you can make!,,,
2016,5,Wonderful app for searches where you're not sure where you want to go but know the time frame you're looking for and want the cheapest fares!,,,
2016,5,"Very useful and so friendly, I can save my money now..thanks for wonderful work.",,,

2016,5,I appreciate the different options to view monthly fares,,,
2016,5,"Muy buena aplicaci√≥n,  consigue las mejores ofertas a un par de toques",,,
2016,5,Uma ferramenta realmente poderosa para encontrar o melhor voo.,,,
2016,3,"Now when I choose the cheapest dates in a month price diagram and then check all the flight for the chosen dates, the prices change! It seems that the prices in the calendar are not updating on time and you can see the real prices only when you pick the final dates. Very misleading! I would like to keep using skyscanner as I have been doing for many years, but.. Hope you can fix it.",,,
2016,1,"I tried paying with my card and it was declined multiple times. I figured that there might be something wrong with my card so my mom tried it instead and it was still declined by this company. With all this time that I have wasted trying to get them to accept my payment, I most certainly could have gone elsewhere and bought a cheaper flight because they are far more expensive now. If an HR representative reads this, they had better find someway to pay me back for the ridiculous amount of stress I've been in",,,
2016,3,I signed up with email but can't login to the app. When I select login the email and password entry screen opens momentarily then a blue block of text shows up at the bottom saying Google Smart lock and my email address. As soon as it fades the main login screen returns (the one with login options like Facebook etc.) before I can even type in my email or password. I'd like to create an alert and don't want to use social login which is why I signed up with email but it seems to have been pointless. Nexus 6p,,,
2016,1,Saigon to hanoi... There 's maybe more than 20 flights daily (no it 's not a joke).... In this app... I have 1 flight every month and very expensive (most expensive ever as in vietnam it 's really cheap the flights)... I have no idea how this app finds such expensive flights (maybe only from the most expensive company only),,,
2016,5,"It's like going to the doctor in us. You never know exactly the price or value you are receiving on most airlines. Be transparent!! If I want to pay for better seat or class, I will. You do not have to con me. I recognize the value of a sleeper on a 20 hour flight to asia.",,,
2016,5,I only write reviews when I'm frustrated or impressed. Have seen all other apps (those relevant to India at least) and Skyscanner looks up ALL offers from all websites and agents to REALLY get you best deals including any cashback options on obscure websites you may have never heard of before. I've recently done three such bookings and have saved at least 5% over and above the best rate offered. Without a doubt presently the undisputed King of Flight Bookings in the app market...,,,
2016,1,"Was double charged to the tune of $380.  He's the charge removed,  just to see that our tickets were canceled.  Customer service atrocious.  $380 went somewhere and now we have no tickets. Will never book through this app again.",,,
2016,1,"The new interface is dreadful, people shouldn't have to ask for help in Play reviews. The old one was far clearer and more streamlined, the new one is just confusing and nothing takes you where you expect. I'll just use the website.",,,
2016,3,"For some reason it's showing me prices that are way, way higher than when I search on Google Flights or even directly on the airline site. I double checked to confirm that specs are the same (airports, dates, etc.) and they are. Weird.",,,
2016,1,I  despise the new update so much that I'm going back to using kayak I guess. This was my favorite travel app ever. Now it's trash.,,,
2016,2,"Checking the same app on two mobiles, android and apple. Apple has much more offers therefore much better prices. As app I will not use it, better to log in from laptop.",,,
2017,5,You become smarter in flight bookings with this app. The trend helps you pick the best time for cheap tickets. Good real time analysis for quick booking ( helped me while I missed a flight). Easy to use.,,,
2016,5,"Works well on my old Samsung note. Easy to find cheap seats.   Also good on new device, but new version not so easy to use if you so not have a fixed destination in mind.",,,
2016,1,Only want to look for direct flights. Yet have to wade thru 1000's of non direct flights first. As you can only apply filters after an initial basic search.,,,
2016,5,This is a great app for finding tickets. It Is very simple and finds you many flights and you have many options. it is kind of like trivago for airplane tickets. Everyone who wants to simplify buying plane tickets should try this app!!!!,,,
2017,2,"Preferred it before. don't need to be told where to fly to constantly. Beyond me why companies think it's ok to pester you with 'how about doing this?' notifications. That really work? Oh skyscanner suggested I go to Paris, ok then!! I'll go!  :)",,,
2016,1,Each time I Want to search a flight it keeps telling me no results found when I input the town I want to fly from. Pretty useless. Am uninstalling,,,
2016,3,I usually love this app but for some reason it's not showing all of the available airlines for flights. Will this issue be fixed soon?,,,
2016,5,"Best app. It always shows me the best deals, and because of that I have been able to see many places I would have otherwise not been able to. Best app ever.",,,
2016,5,Great for being able to see when cheapest rather than going through actual dates.  I like to plan holidays around cheap flights so much better than other sites,,,
2016,4,"It's a great app. And very helpful .. only one thing is missing , ""The Multi-City"" search option. I hope to get it soon",,,
2016,4,Very good in finding cheap flights... but few flights are seen on the site... Still its a great app,,,
2016,3,Have had this app on n off my phone for the last 2 years.  Don't like the last update.,,,
2016,2,App works fine but some flights are overpriced. One flight with easyjet was twice the price compared to using the easyjet app!,,,
2016,4,"I love the way I can search the flight details. It helps me to plan my holidays or travel, just on my handset.",,,
2016,1,The selection by airlines doesn't work. I always use it without problem until two version ago,,,
2016,5,Good price analysis. Easy to use interface. Allows flexible ways of travelling when searching for price.,,,
2016,5,"I am a traveler, I need quick and certain info ... I found it here... great app... couldnt find cheaper flights...",,,
2016,5,"Outstanding tool for holidaymakers, without it I couldn't manage to prioritize my multi-city trips.",,,
2016,5,Always looking for last minute flights for a quick and fun 2 day trip. It helps being able to search flights to anywhere.,,,
2016,5,Best app ever.Always very low prices. Was recommended by co worker and i have used it multiple times.,,,
2016,1,Used to be good but now is awful the user interface & layout. Definitely not on a par with Kayak,,,
2016,5,Love the interface and the ability to search tons of flights. Being able to save results is nice as well.,,,
2016,4,Vary intiitive minimalist user interface. Vary fast you can find best prices.,,,
2016,5,This app is easy to use and finds better prices than other apps in this category. 5 stars.,,,
2016,4,Really like it. Improvements should be made in how price are shown!,,,
2016,4,Love it for checking quick flight price. Easy and fast results.,,,
2016,4,We always love this app and use it to choose cheapest flight available from location.,,,
2016,5,Filters and settings are easy to use and simple. Results provided are accurate! Awesome stuff,,,
2016,5,It helps me get the cheapest rate and allows me to change time and flights. This app is awesome,,,
2016,5,There's a new airline called Siam Air from Bangkok to Singapore to Bangkok flight route which is not in the app?,,,
2016,5,Easy to use and accurate.  Booked many trips using this app.,,,
2016,5,So far the best prices for flights that I've come across!,,,
2016,5,"Very convenient. The navigation, filter are very easy to use",,,
2016,4,I've tried several times using this apps. So far so good,,,
2016,1,"Difficult to use, main website is better. The previous app was so much better.",,,
2016,3,Its showing completely different prices in the app and the website..Is it only for me??!!,,,
2016,1,Very poor this app now old one was awesome you should fix soon,,,
2016,5,As a standby passanger this app is amazing! Just pay attention to bag fees because sometimes they are more than the ticket!,,,
2016,2,"Misleading UX - why does it start on the NEXT month and not the current, and not warning about it??",,,
2016,5,This app had become essential to me. Keep up the good work!,,,
2016,3,There is no multi stop option as opposed to the desktop version.,,,
2016,5,I use this app religiously when I'm traveling the country.  Has saved me so much money!,,,
2016,2,"Agree with other comments, the older version was much easier to use.",,,
2016,1,Okay app but no multi city option which really let's it down !,,,
2016,5,I found my flight using this app. I got my flight cheaper than any others,,,
2016,5,So useful but bring back the world view for searches without a set destination!,,,
2016,5,I'm a travel agent and this app tells me where to book inexpensive travel on a certain date.,,,
2016,5,Dedicated to middle class so economic app loved it i think cheapest,,,
2016,5,Use it very often and am happy with it for many years now.,,,
2016,5,Love this app and the ability to see the lowest prices by the dates listed.,,,
2016,5,I really enjoy and like the app. It is to details and very helpful,,,
2016,4,Search facility a little complicated sometimes and crashes on the phone.,,,
2016,5,Awesome fast easy and starts from cheapest flights highly recommend,,,
2016,2,Unlike the website you can't search for several destinations on a single journey.,,,
2016,5,Easy to book and search from multiple airports!! :-),,,
2016,5,So easy to use and the cheapest flight prices out there,,,
2016,5,Really I see this is the best one to find cheap flight,,,
2016,5,It's one of the best app for booking airline tickets,,,
2016,5,Quick and useful application. Recommend you install it,,,
2016,3,"Pakistan, karachi, Jinnah International Airport!  Please!",,,
2016,5,"Cuman beri opsi lebih detail ttg review nya seperti versi yg lama, versi baru agak sedikit bingung",,,
2016,1,"I downloaded this app because of a great deal on a flight i was looking for, and then wound up cancelling the flight. Why? I thought something was odd when two hours after booking and paying for my flight, no charge had yet been placed on my card. I then recieved an email saying to call customer service as soon as possible regarding my reservation. I was directed to a call center in Georgia where i spoke to a rude man with a heavy Indian accent who told me that the airline ticket price went up by $800!BS!",,,
2016,3,"I like to go find routes and prices, then go onto  proper airlines websites to book. I wont update as people say its not worth it. Its crap you cant have multi city, im planning a trip soon but cant check in the app...",,,
2016,2,This used to be such  a useful easy to use app  for scanning  flights  and prices.  Now it involves  starting  from the beginning  everytime  the departure  needs changing. Also the information  is nowhere near  as precise  as the previous version.  Probably a good thing  all in all as it'll stop  me from being  tempted to book weekends  away all the time.,,,
2016,2,Don't like the new interface. Makes what was once a simple to use app overly complicated. I also miss the feature that let you quickly flip the to/from cities.  Was very useful when comparing one way flights to return flights. Now it seems you have to  start a brand new search from the  start  page to compare the  one way flight back ?,,,
2016,4,"I found the app great however some minor tweeks to the selection/home page. It would be good to have the date option in a simplied form i.e. in a digital form. Also, it would be good to be able to select the airline preference on the first page before the app starts to load the flights. Thanks :)",,,
2016,3,Loved this app the way it was!!! I don't like the update on this app. Can't visibly see cost of flights and set days without pressing it first. You use to be able to see the cost of flights going on different days. Not impressed. Bring back the old style app.,,,
2016,3,Used to be really good but the latest version appears to be somewhat buggy regularly saying retry when populating the flight search list. This is not a network issue on my side. Searching for direct flights also used to be very easy but is now a chore.,,,
2016,1,"Updates yet again ruin a great app. Over complicated, long winded searches and constant false prices! After 5 years I'm deleting for good!",,,
2016,3,"Made several searches and when forwarded websites the prices are never the same. And it's not just a couple of euros, it's a lot more.  Is this some problem or it's normal?",,,
2016,3,"Not been away for a few years due to babies. However, you used to have a map that users could quickly scan between possible departure and destination locations. Where is the map now? This was an amazing feature...",,,
2016,3,"There is no easy way to get results only for direct flights. You need to get all results and after it fully loads, apply a filter for direct flights, which is very cumbersome. The results shown are good but sometimes there is a slight increase in price when you actually want to book it.",,,
2016,2,What on earth have you done? You literally murdered the android app! I can't even look for the cheapest month option anymore. Such a waste of time. I'm back on the Web browser website.,,,
2016,2,There's no option to turn off these obnoxious push notifications. I like the app I barely use it but now I'm getting these and I can't turn them off. I'd rather uninstall the app and reinstall each time I use it.,,,
2016,5,"It was an amazing App! Last update just changed everything: usability is not intuitive, app performances decreased and we are missing a lot of Key functions.",,,
2016,5,The best ever app that give you the best price with no hidden charges.. This app never let me down. üëç,,,
2016,5,"My family often traveling, this apps really help us to booking ticket at last minute. We have crazy price",,,
2016,4,Very nice to see an app that lets you explore different places you can travel. Love the discovery and call out to direct flights.,,,
2016,5,Great way to keep up to date on the cheapest flights in specific days in the go. Makes for a wonderful escape in searching possibilities of future travels.,,,
2016,5,Sky scanner just got even better. Booking on your mobile is a piece of cake. Thanks guys,,,
2016,1,"no cheap flights. it shows only the expensive fares. no currency option, stuck with british pounds.",,,
2016,5,I typically use Google flights and have found this to be comparable.  It would be cool to see the lowest price for the same flights regarding different currencies.,,,
2017,5,I've been using this app for a couple of years... So far is the best one to find cheap prices on flights...,,,
2016,2,Where is the fare calender? Changing any setting you need to go all out. Not intuitive anymore.,,,
2016,4,Its me the lowest prices possible. I used other apps but this is pretty good.,,,
2016,4,Easy to use...great for last minute travel.. If stuck somewhere perfect use...,,,
2016,5,Book all my flights using this app. From my summer holidays to a few days away..,,,
2016,2,New interface is clumsy and awkward to use. Older versions were better.,,,
2016,3,"Trying to fly from DC to Vancouver on the way there, Portland to DC on way back. Can't do that option. Where's the multi-city option?",,,
2016,4,Easy to work with but I found that one of the referred agencies pulled a bait and switch on me and was non responsive when I tried to contact them.  eDreams,,,
2016,5,I got my flight 300 dollars cheaper than I was expecting to pay! Very happy,,,
2016,5,"it helps to find low fair flights, not only the single destination , it works around the world",,,
2016,5,"Thanks for this app, I was able to save hundreds on my travels.",,,
2016,4,It's a good application. .. where as it have a pop up when rates go down  .. I like this app,,,
2016,2,"I put on filters and it doesn't find any flights. When i go to individual airline sites or other sites, my flight is available.",,,
2016,3,"Unable to filter out airlines like Spirit, who I would never fly.",,,
2016,4,Best of all the online shopping stores.I like it very much and also recommend all to use this app,,,
2016,4,Very flexable.  Lets me know the costs and I choose from there.,,,
2016,5,"Multiple vendors, airlines etc searched seamlessly and the best rates put forward. Simple. Brilliant.",,,
2016,4,"Very easy to use, I really love it especial for domestic flights.",,,
2016,5,"Its good.You can find almost all available airlines, even rotana jet which is not available on other sites.",,,
2016,5,Awesome app gets you the best prices I've used this app multiple times over the years never failed me,,,
2016,4,Need to add rayani air as well for malaysia airlines.,,,
2016,4,Easy to look for flights filtered according to your preference,,,
2017,4,please enable multi city search from the app for international flights,,,
2016,5,"Thanks for a great, speedy and much so convenient app :)",,,
2016,5,"Very easy to use, loads of options, very flexible, god I'm diving in joyness",,,
2016,5,The wonderful app gives very easy access to all details required,,,
2016,5,I use this app for find filght to everywhere. It good to use every day.,,,
2016,5,Love being able to have it as a widget on my screen!,,,
2016,5,It would be great if you give some special discount,,,
2016,5,Can look up any destination and the improvements are fantastic,,,
2016,5,Easy to use and does what it needs to do without complication!,,,
2016,4,Sometimes it will not show which airline is on the selected route and how to order the tickets,,,
2016,4,It gives more options and facilities than any other,,,
2016,1,"I can't understand why you changed completely the app, before it was so easy and quick to use, now there are many step and stuff to click and it is so difficult to find direct flights option, or even to swap the flight to find the return flight itself. I used to love this app and now I hate it.",,,
2016,5,Simply the best App and MUST HAVE App if you are traveller or backpacker.,,,
2016,5,"Along with one way and return fair, please add multi city option as well..",,,
2016,3,How to disable the multiple airlines options? I think the previous design is easier to use.,,,
2016,4,"Found the app in a Suduko game.. ""Everything you about Skyscanner"" ... Check your adds people !!     Otherwise its great : )",,,
2016,5,Its easy to use and it gives a lot of options depends on ur needs.,,,
2016,1,"Skyscanner devs, it is clear that you are NOT listening to app users because nearly 98% of all ratings after the update are 1 or 2 stars. If you are listening, return the app to how it was before the update, then do improvements a little bit at a time. If you continue on this course, you will lose many old customers and ALL new ones. Who is going to dl an app with all 1 stars and negative reviews? Stop with the canned responses to comments too. They make things look even worse.",,,
2016,2,"I am what's known as a frequent flyer and have used Skyscanner since the early days. I just went to install it on a new Android phone and noticed all the poor reviews. My  curiosity got the better of me so I had to  check it out. I'm sorry to say that the reviews are right. It really is not a good experience now. In fact, for the flights I had to book today I went to the app for Windows phone, which is still clean and works well. Sorry but it's thumbs down from me.",,,
2016,1,"The new iteration of your app is just bad UX, bad UI and design all around. The search options are harder to access, the results list harder to read. There is a clear lack of grid and general content organisation. There is no real contrast anymore so also very hard to read. I wish I had not upgraded. Epic fail!",,,
2016,1,"I used to love this app. I rated this app before and the developer said that we're going to do more updates. I almost never rate the apps  unless I really love them or hate them.  I tried the update and now I would like to drop to 1 star You're bar graph now is terrible, interface is difficult.  POSSIBLY if somebody   could just read the comments from your followers you might figure it out.  All you had to do was work on accuracy of your results.  I used to tell somebody about your app every day, now none.",,,
2016,1,"If you loved Skyscanner's great search features and user friendliness, do not update. Features removed, common work flows take way more clicks, weird non-standard UI decisions. I've never left a review of an app until now, but I feel compelled to express my frustration that a 5 star app turned into a 1 star app in one update.",,,
2016,2,"This version is terrible. UI is very clumsy. The dates selected don't seem to be saved when checking flights to possible destinations so you have to keep re-selecting them over and over. For users who know their exact destination, maybe this is OK, but for those frequently selecting flights to Everywhere, this app is disappointing. It's easier to manually search your destinations using Kayak now.",,,
2016,1,"It was previously very easy to see prices at a glance far in advance. which would allow for easily planning trips. Now it's time consuming and you have to choose date and cross your fingers that it is the lowest price since it's just a green dot to tell you you're within a ""fair price range"" now. When using the bar option it's no better, you have to seek out the lowest bar visually. It doesn't give you a ""hint price"" with a line extended as it previously did.",,,
2016,1,"I had for 5 year this app in apple device! Just yesterday i bought an Samsung s6 and i download all application that i had in iphone... the worst is this app? Is completly different , is impossible to swap the destination... the graphic is very bad! Why is so difficult made a 1 app for all device? 1 star becouse for find a cheaper price here is very hard... whit iphone is 1000000 time better! I wanted change phone becouse is 3 iphone that i broken with water... samsung is waterproof.",,,
2016,1,"Please please bring back the previous version! I used to love and use  skyscanner exclusively (we are on year 2 of rtw travel) but this update has been extremely painful to use. If you just needed a new look, it could have been done without changing the architecture--unless it was for the better. This is not better.",,,
2016,3,"I have used Skyscanner for a long time and found this latest update confusing, I'm not a fan of the calendar view with the dots and it wasn't obvious how to see the bar chart. I've figure out how to see it but because the calendar is the default view I always have to press it which is annoying. Please tell your developers to allow this preference to be saved in the next update, I think it will make a lot of your users happy who prefer the old search. Thanks!",,,
2016,3,"I use this app on a daily basis & I honestly think that you should just downgrade back to the former version. It was much simpler, quick, & user friendly. But now too many useless images with complicated interface. Though this app will always be my favorite, absolutely love it.",,,
2016,1,"Much worse than the older version. Too many steps, too many images, not streamlined. Not possible to look for multiple flights. I am a heavy user.I am using the classic version/website nowadays.  To that I would give 4.5 stars any day of the week.  As we say in Romania,  you just blew your nose in the perfect bean soup.",,,
2016,2,"This used to be a great app for finding deals with flexible travel dates.  Your changes destroyed what was good and unique about this app.  If I wanted to play guess the departure date, i would use Kayak or Travelocity.   Way to destroy a great product. I'm unistalling.  Too bad, I bet I told 2 dozen people about your old app.  It was great.",,,
2016,2,"I found a flight through Expedia for an amazing price on the app, but when I went to cross-check it on the website, the flight wasn't listed. I know this app gives you the option to book the flight from your phone, but it felt way too sketchy for me. I also needed to look for a multi-city flight, but it seems that's not an option.",,,
2016,1,New version doesn't let you select flight times as easily & search results are full of horrid 4am red eye flights.  Screens are cluttered. Pushes you to select country then airport rather than jump straight to airport. Was my previous default flight search engine will probably go elsewhere now.,,,
2015,2,"I use this app very frequently and have done for many years.  I find the updated version much more effort to use.  Instead of being able to put your search data in on one page,  it's now a series of around 5 pages. So time consuming. It's turned from a great simple,  quick app, to an overly complicated one with too many superfluous steps.",,,
2016,3,"The search results display is horrible. Expedia's list of flights shows the airports that the flights connect to, which makes it much easier to focus on OPEN airports (versus SkyScanner's method of requiring that I click on each result to see the connecting airports). Sure, it isn't a frequent need, but IS a need nonetheless.",,,
2016,1,"Went on this app after upgrade.  Immediately thought what now???   Came on here to predict all the complaints and i wasn't wrong.    Seriously! Change it back! It's impossible to use and not user friendly in the slightest.   Will use the quote many a person have used.....""if it aint broke, don't fix it"" u can IMPROVE but don't change it completely. Madness lol",,,
2016,1,Rubbish following update! It used to be my go to app for buying tickets but recent changes have made the app unusable. Bring back the old version or I'm un installing it (as I suspect many have done already),,,
2016,3,I'm using OnePlus One. New update I can't even use back button. Either on screen button or the apps back button. I have to force close the apps in order to make a new search or modify my search parameter. Its a huge disappointment for me. It was awesome previously,,,
2016,2,"Was extremely useful and easy to use :-( but nowadays, not even close to what was once! Many possible connections do not appear. Low cost airlines, only found them suggested on possible direct flights. Best cheapest option suggested a second ago... ‚Ç¨700... 43hours! Low cost option I know exists ‚Ç¨250... 10hours! :-(",,,
2016,3,What have you done to this app? I thought updates were supposed to make things better. It was a 5 star app & much easier to use before. I've been using it for years & told many people about it. It's like a completely different app to the last time I used it.,,,
2016,3,Many people don't have the pressure to flight in a specific date...we are asking for the unique feature of Select 2 or 3 weeks to Departure and 2 or 3 weeks for Return to choose ...instead of the limited 1 day Select to Go and 1 day select to Return that the app is giving us ...and once done the alert on your email box until the user stopped because have selected the best price,,,
2016,2,"....Don't Fix It! By a mile, this was the best Flight search App around. It was also the easiest on the eye. Now we have small  text on a white background ... and it is unnecessarily cluttered. Having said that I have every confidence that the layout will soon be back to where it neefs to be :-)",,,
2016,2,This used to be a great app to easily find lowest prices without entering travel dates.  Thats what made the app Great.  I could check rates all year long and plan several trips.  I dont even see all the airlines that it used to show. Allegient Air was almost always the lowest fares.  Now they dont even show up.,,,
2016,2,I use this app a lot! I loved the older simpler version. Now it's too time consuming. Too many different pages and trying to compare prices for a whole month and direct flights has gone too complicated. Please fix,,,
2016,1,Please bring back the old version. This app is a tool. Ease to use always come first. Fancy looking won't help me searching the info I want. I need a simple and easy to use app. Look at the review of the first few pages. Please bring back the old version.,,,
2016,1,I tried this based on a recommendation. Put info in to tack a specific flight and it never gave me any updates. Now the flight is 200 more. Would have purchased last... really disappointed now I have to pay more then anticipated,,,
2016,3,"This was the best app for finding flights listed with colorful easy bar charts, but the new update (coupled with the untimely rise in airline flights) messed it all up. I loved the old Skyscanner app. RIP. It was fun while it lasted.",,,
2016,1,New updated version of this app is terrible. It has become over complicated and difficult to use. The free flowing easy browsing excellent old app has been completely overhauled and replaced with this. I booked flights through the old app but I wouldn't bother trying with this new version. Sort it out.,,,
2016,1,"I am trying to put in where I am departing from, and it isn't working. I put the ""city, code to the airport, United States"" (as it shows in the picture) and nothing. Just shows a blank screen. I even put just the code in and still nothing. Phone LG V10.",,,
2016,4,Very useful & convenient esp when one lives abroad. Love how it shows you when the most expensive time to book flights to your destination with colour Co ordination!! Pity about non mobile friendly options that come up though!,,,
2016,1,"What happened? New update. Punch in cities and dates from graph, after that it just stops there. I cant check out the different pricings of that day from different scource. Used to able on previous updates",,,
2016,2,"The whole point i liked this app was that it gave you the prices of the day i wanna fly right in the search box, now i have to search over and over to find a price for that day, i might as well save the space on my phone and use a regular site. It was good while it lasted üòû",,,
2016,1,The last version was much better and easier to use. I'm still waiting an interface with the opportunity to search only weekends. 0 intuitive. I gave 1 star because I have to..,,,
2016,5,"This app has a great overall overview, quick to view prices, dates etc. Easy to use, press 1 button done, press another done. Easy to understand and finds always great deals. U can create alerts for price changes too!",,,
2016,3,"It's a great concept but the data can be buggy. A long range search reveals some months have 'no data'. So is that an airline problem or an app Issue? As I'm an ex airline employee, my guess is that it's likely the app.",,,
2016,2,I used the old version on a daily basis. I used to search for the while month and now cannot work out how to do that. I find it easier to go in via the internet and use the website rather than the app :-(,,,
2016,1,"Loved the app prior to new updated, new update is unnecessary complicated almost to the point it's messy. Found myself downloading other apps but even they no comparison to original app. Please update consider rolling back",,,
2016,1,"Old version  was easy and simple to use. Now it has small font and is  tedious to use,  they removed some of the best screen design and replaced it with a frustrating interface. Too much hassle to use.",,,
2016,1,I use to love this app . But the update is not user friendly . It is a mess and not easy on the eye. I found myself getting irritated using it. Why do you have to break one of the best apps around?,,,
2016,5,"Simple to use, no issues on HTC One M8, very smooth and a lot of detail/information is displayed in an easy way to understand. Couldn't have made it simpler/easier to book a flight. Very ergonomical.",,,
2016,2,"Searches and bookings made via skyscanner website allows multi-city flights. However in app, only round-trip and one-way options available. Would appreciate if developer could add a multi-city option.",,,
2016,1,"What a disaster, complicated, extra steps, unclear, reduced search options.  Never commented before on an app, but how can you get it so wrong.  Used this for years and always recommended, looking for an alternative now sadly.",,,
2016,1,The upgrade is poor! The app is difficult to use and the flight prices are always out dated.. The old app was excellent and I don't understand why the developers tried to fix what wasn't broken!,,,
2016,1,Use to be great - the update has totally ruined it. Previously you could travel to or from 'everywhere' to find cheapest price to an undecided destination; now you need to specify your departing/returning airport.,,,
2016,1,Rarely go back to review an App after an update but I'm so unimpressed I felt I had to. Ability to search for direct flights has gone along with unfriendly interface. Why the upgrade??,,,
2016,5,"Absolutely love this app. I find amazing deals. One of my favorite resources. Keep up the good work! I don't care who makes money, as long as I save some.",,,
2017,2,"Used to be great. Trying to search flights to a smaller airport in California from the UK  and it says there's no flights - seriously??? Can go on Google and get them,  no problems. LAME",,,
2016,5,Does everything well. I don't need any other app for my flight booking. I particularly like the fact that you can do everything in your home currency; this function doesn't seem to be available on the version for Windows Phone.,,,
2016,1,"Now pretty much unusable, crashes regularly, buttons don't work, user interface not very easy to use. Can we have the old version back?",,,
2015,2,Once you sign in the app changes. On the trial version it displayed dots with price range.  I don't like the format of the date nor the military time,,,
2016,5,"I rate it 5 becouse its a great app , one of the best , but i have to say last update is a total disaster. It doesent find all best routs anymore ,like iff you are looking for a direct flight it shows you the expensive ones and iff you are looking for return aswell its going to find you cheaper ones.",,,
2016,2,This app seems to have changed significantly and I'm not sure if it's for the better. I'm not receiving any alerts for my watched flights even though I've set them up in skyscanner and the prices have changed since then.,,,
2016,5,Fantastic app in which it easy beats any other in the market. Have used for the last two years and booked many flights through them. Must have on any device i buy. Thanks guys !!,,,
2016,2,"Used to love this app, would use it for all my flights. It's now become unnecessarily complicated. This update is definitely a backward step.",,,
2016,5,"I've used this a lot to buy flights, a very useful app. Usually finds the cheapest fares out there. Recommended. No annoying ads. Thumbs up.",,,
2015,2,The new update is horrendous!  It is far from user friendly. Now I go online or use your competitor. My friends who travel frequently agree.,,,
2016,1,It used to be possible to pick out the cheapest flights over a period of several months helping you to choose which dates to go on holiday. When it's not broke don't fix it .,,,
2016,5,"Best application, give lots of options at very cheap rate. I think it is better then all the other flight applications. Really appreciate. Keep it up",,,
2016,1,I used this app almost everyday. .The new version is so difficult to use...it's not user friendly!! I am now uninstalling the app!,,,
2016,4,I'm new to this app so I may not have explored all possibilities as yet. Would like to separate the time frame between outgoing and return flight,,,
2016,1,"Old version was great,could see the flights for the year,and chose the cheapest.This option has gone,you have to enter the dates,with no way find the cheapest.",,,
2016,2,"Every time I choose flight I need to click ""1 way only"" , since ""return flight"" is always selected by default. I think it should be possible to have an option in a menu to select what type of flight should be the default one.",,,
2016,3,"I'm missing the option for multi-stop flights. Otherwise it's a decent app, but I can't book anything on here until I'm able to book multi-stop.",,,
2016,1,Used to love this app about it's great interaction and user friendliness. Now it's the opposite. Rollback to the previous version before it's too late!,,,
2016,4,I like that it saves my filters. It'd be great if the widget could display my filtered searches. Otherwise it'd give it 5 stars.,,,
2016,1,Always loved and used this app until this update! They've spoilt it. To complicated now and no graph view any more,,,
2016,4,Have been using this app for a long time now. I find the updated version more informing. Just now booked for a holiday to fiji.thanks skyscanner,,,
2016,2,this new update is no good. when you press back it goes to the beginning and erases the dates and destination every single time. annoying. I want the old one back.,,,
2016,2,"The old version was so nice, fast, and easy to use. This new one is confusing and difficult to use. The old Skyscanner app was THE app to use. The new one, not so much.",,,
2019,2,it used to be great now it is useless every time I set up a search alert... I get emails with the itinerary or search alert changed. don't like it anymore,,,
2016,1,Last version was 10 times better..This is pure terrible...And they save your iPhone information go jack up the price later...Not good at all..,,,
2015,1,"Will be using the website instead. The app became unusable crap. Thanks developers -  ""good job""!",,,
2016,2,"Before, you could see lowest prices per day. Now it only shows one day. It's become an Expedia type of app. No bueno.",,,
2016,5,Really good choice of flights that are a great value for money. Also a really nice easy app layout. One of my main priority apps and a must for travelers,,,
2016,1,Awesome App! But bring back the old version. The new app sucks in many ways. Not user friendly at all!,,,
2016,1,This app now does the same as any other flight checker. It has lost it's ease of use completely and its unique selling point.,,,
2016,3,I really liked the widget of the old version. You could save a flight and watch the price each time you look at your phone. It was right in your face and constantly updated. Can you bring it back?,,,
2016,2,Can't move the app to SD card. UI is much worse. Will stay with PC version. Fix it,,,
2016,3,Samsung Galaxy Note2. It would be great if we can save our favorite trips and price alert with flexible days. Thanks,,,
2015,3,I felt the previous versions were more user friendly I find it a little more of an effort to find my flights. I do like that you can see the cheapest months at a glance.,,,
2016,4,I am unable to find a Multicity option for searching flights! It would be great if you could add it in the app! üòá,,,
2016,2,This updated version is not good i these this app daily now I found it harder to use and see the monthly fares to Compare the prices wish u didn't update it now!,,,
2016,1,"Wife told  me,  do not upgrade,  u be sorry!!.  Ant she was dead right.  Why,  whyyy!!!  It was good,  simple app to use,  now is too complicated. just making nervous always when using.",,,
2016,5,Can't believe I waited so long to check this so out... Much better than a lot of other apps and most websites that I use for researching flights.,,,
2016,2,I use this app quite often. The old version was so much more straightforward and easy to use. This new version is definitely not an improvement.,,,
2016,1,App worked great until recent updates. It's really hard to use now. Not very inituitive.,,,
2016,5,Did what I wanted ... found what I wanted got the deal I wanted and struck the deal direct with the airline cheaper after finding a flight.. will use again for long haul,,,
2016,5,I have had no problems in using this app. Works for me and gives a comparison of different travel agencies in seconds. Good app.,,,
2016,5,"Very easy to search flights. Plus, it color-codes the flight calendar so you can spot cheap flight days at a glance.",,,
2015,5,"Very reliable app I use every time to buy my tickets. Also offering very competitive price, sometimes the cheapest price you may find. Also you can set reminder to alert you in case of price dropped or getting even higher",,,
2016,1,"I used to be using the old app daily for booking flights for me and many others but the with the recently update, it's so bad that I never useskyscanner anymore!!",,,
2016,2,The quotes I get are always for return flights so to compare I have to go to each destination and each date and manually select one way. Why can't it let me default searches to one way only?,,,
2016,2,Why did you have to change the app. .its rubbish now. .it was so easy to follow before now is just all over ther place and no where near as straight forward !!! üò†üò†üò†,,,
2016,5,Great app! Provides heeps of information on range of airlines and their prices! BUT one problem there is no provision for muslim meal!,,,
2016,1,Older version worked well. Foolishly updated and will probably uninstall. Cannot use and I am an experienced it professional.,,,
2016,5,"Great APP but crashing on Android 6.0.1;                                  Edit: last update seems to have fixed it, changing to 5 stars.",,,
2016,1,"Why changing? The interface was reliable and simple to use, now it's way more complicated and time consuming!",,,
2016,1,"Before the update, I could very easily switch airports, now I literally have to clear my cache & my app data just to change airports! This update RUINED the app for me!",,,
2016,5,Use this app all the time. Love how you can view the whole month and select the cheapest fare. Also having the nearby airports displayed is great instead of having to go back to the search page. Recommend to anyone.,,,
2016,1,I used to love it and used every time for flight bookings. Now its useless and crashes all the time. Design is completely OTT,,,
2016,5,"It works fast, has friendly interface. Saves your search. This app really helpful and saves your money.",,,
2016,5,"I always start here,  i literally found RT from PDX TO LAS $44... I am a real person and use it all the time ...rarely do they not have the cheapest. Start here",,,
2016,1,This app used to be great as was able to look at a full month and see which was cheapest day to fly. Not able to do that anymore. I guess this was a huge reason people downloaded this app.,,,
2016,2,Prices are definitely higher than booking from airline website. Not all airlines that serve a particular destination is shown.,,,
2016,5,It's very easy and I got a plans for the next vacation with all family... Thank you sooooo much Skyscanner...mwaaah,,,
2016,2,Newest update makes it harder to find cheap flights. Never had a problem before this. Really disappointed.,,,
2016,2,Since you've changed the layout of the app I find it very difficult to search for flights. So i just use the Web version.,,,
2016,1,The new version is really frustrating and complicated to use!!! The view is not very friendly. Please provide option to get the older version!!!,,,
2015,3,"Great app and it's saved me loads, but recently I've been looking at flights and the price displayed in the app is about ¬£10 different when I try and book.",,,
2016,4,Great for option selection. For last return flight got lower price though by booking direct with airline online.,,,
2017,1,I originally gave it 5 stars but now you cannot search for the whole month. Lost its use for me. Booo,,,
2016,5,"I love this app, I go on here at least once a day to check for tickets. Nothing else compares to these prices!",,,
2016,2,Used to be good. After I updated the new version the price has gone up about ¬£120 . ridiculous,,,
2016,2,Compared to the website. I understand the USA don't recognize Cuba but that doesn't mean flights don't exist.,,,
2016,5,A great flight search app. Easy to understand and genuine search results. Booked a flight this week using it.,,,
2016,1,New update is absolutely appalling.. go back to the old version.. awful,,,
2016,5,"A good reference. I would suggest to confirm prices directly with the agencies/airlines, before you book.",,,
2016,4,Easy app to find flight price and a good time to travel. I liked the app better before the update.,,,
2016,4,"Works perfectly for planning your travels, gives you most options possible very quickly!",,,
2016,5,It does well what it says! Would be good if you could plan a trip with several destinations...,,,
2016,5,"Very simple & easy to use. Best prices, great flight info and no hidden fees.",,,
2016,5,Skyscanner is easy to use and even includes flights on Southwest. While it is simple to use for beginners even more savvy travelers can use it to find the best deals,,,
2016,1,Why did you change this? It used to be so simple. Its the simple things that work best. Using another app now.,,,
2016,4,Great app. Give right information.i always book my family tickets through sky scanner.,,,
2016,3,Earlier there was an option that shows prices on every date which was very helpful. Now there are only colours which when selected gives a prices which is higher than many more websites.,,,
2016,1,Its more basic with less functions it seems. Looks nice but the older version worked better.,,,
2016,4,Would get 5 stars if it had options such as one way economy and return in business etc. Book all my flights through this app,,,
2016,3,This App definitely needs to include ALL airlines!  It lacks SOUTHWEST airlines in its search results!! It's therefore incomplete.,,,
2016,1,This app was by far my most used app. This update is horrible and has ruined it. PLEASE fix it.,,,
2016,4,why you dont add the Multiple flights options to this app. it will be so much easier and nicer.,,,
2016,1,There no Canadian airline company if I trusted this app completely I would have paid more for my trip .because it do not take in account Canadian airline company,,,
2016,4,"Smart features, great UI and best prices. UX could be better.",,,
2016,4,Great for checking prices! Wish I could pick flight times independently but you can set parameters pretty easily.,,,
2016,5,Easy to use I've booked more than 5 flights untill now. I'm lovin it,,,
2016,4,Easy. But needs an anywhwre selection. I want a cheap flight somewhere im not always concerned with where.,,,
2016,4,Great app for price alerts.  But book fast. Prices can change quickly.,,,
2016,3,Until you don't add multi-stop flights Google Flights is beating you to the core.,,,
2016,5,"After trying 2 other apps above 4 stars, decided to stick with this user friendly app. The other 2 apps were not at all user friendly and surprised they got 4 stars, at the end of the day it is trail and error process.",,,
2016,3,I can Always count on good flight deals with Skyscanner. And its functionality is quick and easy,,,
2016,1,"It was intuitive, fast, reliable. Now is unnecessarily complicated. I want the old one back!",,,
2016,2,"It takes your ip info, and it gives you more costly prices when you ask the price later...",,,
2016,5,"Much more fluent to use now. Takes getting used to after using the old one for so long, but a step in the right direction.",,,
2016,4,"Nice search engine for flight booking, kindly add options for blocking of flights and if it is already available do please let me know",,,
2016,1,"Old app could search between countries for cheapest flights (i.e. United Kingdom to Germany), now I can't. Why?",,,
2016,5,I like very trusted app help me to find my best deals and no extra charge on the final price,,,
2016,1,This new update is useless now. Especially the part when choosing the dates & it shows those bars of prices,,,
2016,4,Works very efficiently and gives options for different dates. Also recommends destinations,,,
2016,5,If it included a refresh rate for the widget.  Even better!  :).,,,
2016,5,A good app to schedule your trip...  Enjoy the vacancy with cheap tickets.,,,
2016,4,I Love this! But the price alert still not in my currency even though I change the setting,,,
2016,3,The app helps me find some really good flights and especially last minute flights but they don't show all flights and the flights are more expensive on skyscanner,,,
2016,1,"The new update is totally pathetic,  never understand it so finally deleted app. Before it was my one of fvt app but the update ruined this.",,,
2016,5,Love it ! It actually work's. Like the layout and so easy to use. Top marks from me,,,
2016,5,Just such a nice n easy flow to this app. Tks to the dev team. Really great work. Gl,,,
2016,5,Amazing app and service. Use them every time I need to book a flight.,,,
2016,3,"Better than the web search, should be easier to change airports. Be nice if it defaulted to direct flights.",,,
2016,5,Love this app. Remembers previous searches. Alerts me to price changes. On the mobile is great for on the go searches.,,,
2016,5,App makes good use of material design. Easy and intuitive navigation.,,,
2016,4,I wish there was a setting where I could set which times during the day I want to travel. Otherwise it's a very nice and clean app,,,
2017,1,Advertised hotels for low rates. Sent you to the hotel website where the rates were either much higher or rooms unavailable.,,,
2016,1,"What happened to all the flexibility options, such as +/- 1 or 2 days. Used to be easier",,,
2016,5,Amazing. So easy and so good. For me is the best. Years I'm using this app,,,

2016,5,"Easy, fast, great information in user-friendly layout",,,
2016,1,Who's the change old version disgusting features new version to much confused change this version and get back old version,,,
2016,1,"Totally awful this update has ruined a once great app, complicated, confusing, this is a lesson in how to destroy a company.",,,
2015,2,Don't like the new calender. How do I see prices for everyday of the month like the old app?,,,
2016,5,It has many user friendly options for better matching of prices which is cool.,,,
2016,4,Booking is easy. But still can get tickets little cheaper elsewhere,,,
2016,4,Older app much easier to see at a glance. Newer app better for buying tickets,,,
2016,5,Very helpful. I depend on it in all my travel plans.,,,
2016,4,Has everything you need and easy search parameters.  Excellent for quick cost estimates.,,,
2016,1,Different price from website than app app 1500‚Ç¨ more expensive flights,,,
2016,5,I travel a lot and this is the only app I use to find my flights.,,,
2016,1,When searching for flights I've found through airlines own websites Skyscanner comes up with nothing...,,,
2016,5,Really like this app to search for cheapest flights for a route!,,,
2016,4,Good apps. Easy to use. Simple easy and convenient.,,,
2016,5,Very well design. So great to be able to see all the destinations when you don't know where to go :),,,
2015,3,Estimates are very far off. Unfortunate bc this app has a lot of potential.,,,
2016,1,"Though the price was shown as rs.7884,but on redirecting to payment page price got changed to rs.23220",,,
2016,4,The application is nice but it does not have the option for multi city search  Can I know when you will add it ??,,,
2016,4,Good app But do not make bookings through this. Do it from the airline website.,,,
2016,4,"Has a few wish list wants, but very helpful app for searching regionally",,,
2016,4,"Though results aren't accurate, app is a great starting point to search for deals on airline tickets.",,,
2016,1,I can't stand to use the new app so complicated compared to old version,,,
2016,4,"Good app, works for me with no big issues, have used it for years now.",,,
2016,1,Hate and will not be using this version until it's been rolled back.,,,
2016,1,Used this for years...now struggling to navigate around it...not clear anymore at all,,,
2016,4,"Only improvement I can suggest is ability to search from Everywhere to a destination, to see best departure airport.",,,

2016,5,A great app with wonderful display and clear instructions,,,
2016,5,Each time when I'm travelling that's where I get my tickets üòä,,,
2016,5,Help me so much to find the cheapest price for travel with plane.,,,
2016,5,Every detail every flight the only flight app u ever need x,,,
2015,1,"I used to love this app but the most recent update made things so much harder. It looks better but I'd rather have better functionality. I couldn't even find how to do a full month search like in the past. Can't believe it. In going to try and find an older apk and hopefully get the old version back. *Update"" the latest version of the app crashes when using the ""everywhere"" search option and adder competing a search the back arrow on the top doesn't work. Have to force close the app and restart. Phase fix.",,,
2015,3,"This is a fun app, that does on a phone most of what Kayak does, with sliders and whoknowswhat. It's fast, and seems complete. Includes SWA which Kayak does not. BUT people! Direct is not what you mean. You mean NON STOP. Get it right. Also, First and Business should not be separate and generate separate lists. I would rather choose #notcoach and have the app show me everything. So I don't have to search twice. Both of these suggestions mean I'm too old. But get it right!",,,
2015,1,Absolutely loved Skyscanner up until the recent update. Now has a completely non user friendly interface which is really confusing and turns a simple 1 minute search into a 10 minute search trying to figure out what all the menus do!! Will now use kayak as my simple search tool from now on. Really let down with this update :(,,,
2015,1,Can't understand why you app developers keep changing things that work so well. My options to travel are always open but the grid view is no longer an option. Keep having to change search dates to find cheapest day to fly. Won't be using again until grid view returns.,,,
2015,4,Please follow the start screen design used for the iPhone app (takes going past 3 pages to see the prices!). Please add feature to add flight as calendar entries (similar to iPhone app). Also option to quickly change billing country along with currency would be great,,,
2015,5,"I like the easy UI this app provides, but sometimes when I use the chart to compare prices especially for multiple airlines, it doesn't show the price except if highlighted. Would've been great if you could include multicity flights as well. Overall a good app and highly recommended for frequent flyers and travellers.",,,
2015,5,*update*     I figured it out. I was just going it wrong.                                                                                                                                              I can search flights but that's it.  It'll show me the list of months and the lowest price per month but I can't do anything with it.  I've looked all over.  I can't find a place to actually choose a flight and book it. I'll give it 5 stars as soon as I get that part going.,,,
2015,4,Great app. Only way to book flights! Just please add a duration filter to widgets so I can filter out 50hr flights I am never going to take!,,,
2015,5,"Faster than most of the applications out there. Give amazing insights on flights. Like shortest duration flight, 2nd one and so on. Aso alerts on flight prices.  The best feature i found was search anywhere from a destination.",,,
2015,1,Gives false information. Promises direct flights even such does not then exist. Does not find existing direct flights. How many other such bugs there are? Will destroy your plans.,,,
2015,5,You want to go somewhere but don't know who to fly with? This is the app for you. Gives you all the flight options to your chosen destination and costs taxes included. I have used this site for years and really love this app,,,
2015,5,A great way of searching and finding the best and cheapest flight rates. Very intuitive to use plus amazing notifications. Has been my primary go to app for flight bookings,,,
2015,2,"Used this App all the time until the update. Use to be very easy to navigate, now it's very fussy and I end up looking for flights elsewhere.",,,
2015,1,"The app shows you one price, but when you tap on the flight to show more details or buy the flight the price will change by a significant amount. Pretty pointless to use if you're not going to quote the correct prices initially.",,,
2015,4,Best apps to get the better flight deal...I would prefer an notification on my phone rather than an email when the prices are going down...,,,
2015,5,Perhaps the best app for quickly finding out the cheapest and most convenient flying options. Multiple filters to help design an optimum traveling experience and very user friendly to use!,,,
2015,5,"I liked your app. Alerts help so much in order to buy more cheap. Very fast, simple to use. Recommend to everyone who likes to fly",,,
2015,5,"Very clear, bright design. Allows you to search for one-way or round-trip tickets according to date, price, airlines, and number of stops. Haven't bought anything yet but seems promising!",,,
2015,4,"Useful app and the best in market for search flies, but why I cann't find any more flies by all month, not by specific date, please fix it.",,,
2015,5,Super easy user interface. Having the ability to see a window of prices in a calendar format is awesome.,,,
2015,5,"I used this app to find the best price for a round trip flight from Chicago to Ercan, Cyprus and it yielded the best prices for sure!  I recommend using this app to search for ANY international flight!",,,
2015,5,Superb arrangement of cheap air fares to costly air fares..                                       Unique apps with all airlines than any other apps..                                             üòç this app,,,

2016,1,Just use the website. Works a lot better and shows more information.,,,
2015,5,This app isvthe best travel app i have ever used. No need to check pricing on other sites because it's already been done.,,,
2015,1,Good idea but about 3/4 of all dates don't have any data.,,,
2015,1,Please change back older version..new version hard to see best offer price.,,,
2015,4,This app is so easy & helpful! You enter your search then you can set an alert and it searches for you.,,,

2015,4,Very useful app to get rates...recommend to couple of friends,,,
2015,5,"Love at first use. Easy, fast and perfect for my needs!",,,
2015,5,Perfect selection for great ideas and new information. I used it often and it is really great.,,,
2015,1,Home airport is ATL...can't compare the largest carrier.,,,
2015,4,Pity cannot choose a whole month in the calendar and see the prices per day,,,
2015,1,Pathetic new interface the old one was simpler and userfriendly..the new one is very complicated,,,
2015,5,I can be alerted of price change. Just wish buying tickets from unknown websites would be safer.,,,
2015,4,Van mejorando en cada actualizaci√≥n por supuesto algunas veces tienes sus peros en los que ahora no caigo pero por ahora bien,,,
2015,5,"I liked that small ball under the dates, showing which day is better to buy a ticket!",,,

2015,5,"The best App, is always giving me the best rates and trips.",,,
2015,5,Happy that a coworker introduced this app to me. I love it!,,,
2015,5,It so convinient to use that in my opinion it is the best flight booking app.,,,
2015,5,Easy to use....many currencies to view price....flexible,,,
2015,5,The best app for booking cheaper tickets and comparing between airlines,,,
2015,5,This app is so easy to use and mobile friendly to boot.,,,
2015,5,Best App for searching different airlines in one place.,,,
2015,5,Always the go to place for flight search at best prices!,,,
2015,5,Fantastic app alerts when prices drop easy to book!,,,
2015,5,Super streamlined.  Also seems to be cheaper then kayak.,,,
2015,5,Half the price of some other sites I was looking on,,,
2015,4,Wish there was a way to eliminate all results for spirit,,,
2015,2,"Being an extensive user the last years on longer travels, this update is just bad. My need is to check for prices for many different routes in a fast way. Before, I had all my search options on one page. Now it's more wizard like, needing more interaction and costing more time. What's the benefit of the destination airport page? If u wanna show me cheaper months, show it beneath the single form as I select. Updates should simplify, not make it more complex. A visual refresh of the app would've be enough.",,,
2015,1,"I'm confused why Skyscanner have decided to butcher their app with this new update. Can't select direct flights only until after the search is complete, you have to double click back just to change departure airport. It's bizarre that Skyscanner would remove these features. This is among other issues I can't remember as I've already uninstalled the app. Luckily Skyscanner have kept the mobile web interface minimal and easier to use so I will stick with that.",,,
2015,2,"After the last update it's more difficult to use it, in my opinion and the font is too small (Samsung galaxy S6 edge. Also many of the economic airlines do not appear in the search results anymore. It is a big disappointed and I have no choice but to stop using it. There are other apps that search all the airlines, thus find cheaper tickets.",,,
2015,2,It use to show the real price with everything included. With the 3rd party charges included in the list price. Now it's listed in small print underneath the price listed. So if I'm truly not saving anything I feel I should just go to the companies Web site. Deal with them directly. Because in case I had any hiccups I would have to deal with the 3rd party I booked through. When you book through the company they typically can work with you since you bought directly.I use to love this app. Not the same anymore,,,
2015,2,"After the last update, it takes longer time on searching.  We cant select direct flight before click search.  And the calendar for cheaper tickets is not reliable as they r juz referring some 1 or 2 stops flights!  Can u give me back the last version??!!",,,
2015,1,The last big update ruined it all! I've always used this app because was so easy to find the cheapest fly. Now it doesn't show all the companies (Ryanair...) and it hasn't the comfy faster UI pre-update. Seems i'm not the only complaining about.,,,
2015,1,Awful new design just awful please go back to old style. Why mess with something that's not broke. This new version looks horrible and is not as user friendly as last version. Guys seriously this is a big flop compared to your last outing what went wrong who on earth decided this was better????,,,
2015,5,"A must have app for anybody that use Airlines on a regular basis. I particularly enjoy and like the alert function for flights you May want to use, and possibly get them at a cheaper price if the date is somewhat in the future by using alert feature. I have just read some of the responses to this app all I know that it save me a massive ¬£65. In my book that makes it a very worthwhile app to have on your phone or even your tablet.",,,
2015,4,"Compared to airline websites, with Skyscanner I found tickets almost  50% cheaper!!! But do compare the ticket you're looking for with other flight apps before making your final decision.  In my case I did find my ticket cheaper through Skyscanner but on the process of searching I gad found cheaper flights with their competitors. However the search methods of this app are 5 star and compared to none! I love it!!",,,
2015,2,Is it possible to roll back to the previous version? This new UI is seriously a horrible horrible horrible design. I don't even review apps but I loved yours...until this update.,,,
2015,1,One of the best apps ruined! Extremely disappointed. You've put trendy white space and loads of scrolling head of function and efficient screen use. Creating a search is long winded compared to previously. The old app was even better than the website.,,,
2015,2,"Get the data correct and this will be a great ap. Love the pricing calendar and the monthly cost summary. Kayak still the best with regards to complete flight info, but lacks the pricing comparison tools of this so and others.",,,
2015,1,I don't understand why you changed the app? It's harder to navigate and search. The website is much better as you can quick search to plan different routes. Such a shame as I use the app to search and book virtually all my flights.,,,
2015,1,Latest update is so confusing loved this App before! Now it's easier to look through all the different Airline websites. Please change it back!,,,
2015,2,"I just can use it if using wifi as connection, otherwise cannot use it. Bfore update, there is no problem. Hope fix it as soon ad possible.",,,
2015,5,"Had a problem with an Airlines direct site prices not showing up anymore, emailed them and they fixed it right away. Fast, quick responses and listened. Thank you, keep up the great work!!!!",,,
2016,5,"Flights to uk/spain always get best flight details, no messing app and updates on prices on the days I want to fly.",,,
2015,5,This app is my go-to app for cheap plane tickets. Price watch is a really neat feature to keep you posted on flights you want to keep track of.,,,
2015,2,"Counter intuitive.  Hate it. Another example of another simple, perfectly functional app that turned crap by trying to be too much. Arghhhhhh!!!",,,
2015,2,"Went to booked a flight I finished and pushed purchase it came up with error, I think it's got something to do with the month when it asks for validation of card most cards have a zero in front of the single digit number but the app only has the single digit.",,,
2015,4,This happens only with the webjet agent. Have been getting the same for every search result. Other than that a great app.,,,
2015,4,The new interface is much clearer and easier to navigate through. Well done.,,,
2015,2,Page cannot load. Been uninstal and re-do also. No use,,,
2015,2,Where's  the option for multi centre flights? Disappointing.,,,
2015,1,It's messy and less easy to use than before. Please change it back,,,
2015,4,Can improve in usability a bit.Seems the booking flow has increased few steps/taps.,,,
2015,3,Can i searching for an open jaw / multi city ticket?,,,
2015,5,"Best flight finder. Using everytime I wanna flight, recommending to everyone.",,,
2015,4,"Didn't like the last update much, but still helps me a lot, love it!",,,
2015,5,"I can't find sometimes all connections, but most of the time prices are lower than Expedia or Opodo.",,,
2015,4,Love the way it also pulls Southwest flight info too!!,,,
2015,2,I preferred the way it woz ..why change and updated an app when it works perfect ..hate this now !! Arghh,,,
2015,5,So far so good booked 3 flights so far very cheap and very easy to use first flight in a few days tickets printed so very good will be keeping this App,,,
2015,5,"So far so good, definitely a much simpler & accurate way to find the best flights!",,,
2015,4,Es  muy buena aplicaci√≥n. No le doy 5 porque a veces he encontrado vuelos mas baratos en otra aplicaci√≥n,,,
2015,5,App show the cheapest days to fly without pressing search. A good reference to compare other apps.,,,
2015,1,New update is the worst thing that ever happened to Skyscanner.,,,
2015,5,Does what it says on the tin...see it book it do it now life is too short cheapest way to travel,,,
2015,5,I get my daughter's every summer from Puerto Rico and have ALWAYS found the cheapest flights here,,,
2015,5,I recommended this application it is very good and sheep trip can find.,,,
2015,5,Beautifully crafted. Does what it's supposed to do :-),,,
2015,5,Thanking you for bringing this highly valuable app to our lives makes life lot easier and safe,,,
2015,5,"Always the cheapest flights, can't use a better app for searching flights",,,
2016,5,Saved me a lot of money booking flights ... Fantastic App ..,,,
2015,5,useful to find air tickets which meet with my budget!!,,,
2015,5,Perfect app makes buying the cheapest flights easy.,,,
2015,5,Shows you all the options helps you find the cheapest flight,,,
2015,5,I saw this app in a youtube vid and i tried and it is awesome !!!!!üòÉüòÉ,,,
2015,4,Wish you could the class of booking or availability,,,
2015,1,"I searched for more than 20 different destinations, multiple dates. Not a single flight found.  Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, nothing fixed the issue.  Clearly something is wrong.   Also liked the old ui much better. Will be using the Web version from now on.",,,
2015,2,Why would you replace your brilliant previous app with this crap. So much more clunky and unreliable. I can't get any prices when i use the graph view. It just says not enough information... dreadful update and will definitely mean I'll be looking to use others instead. The old format app was the main reason i used to use skyscanner!,,,
2015,2,"However, no matter what destination or date i choose it tells me no price is available. I have tried uninstalling etc but no flights come up! It's also not very user friendly. I used to rave about Skyscanner, now I'm not so sure it's the best out there. I can't work out how to make it work!",,,
2015,4,"Updated review: The layout is still different but it's also still a good place to find cheap flights so I gave it more stars.                                                        Oh well. Like all apps the developers couldn't just leave it alone. We all want to old look when looking up flight. Graph chart with the dates. I know there's a way to find it, but it should be the default. It just a used to be more functional, and now it's prettier. Prettier isn't always better.",,,
2015,1,"Why did you take away multiple search windows? In the same window we used to be able to swap origin and destination, such a good feature gone.  Hate that you cannot select all the details, destination, dates, etc all on ONE page. Please please please bring back the original app with some minor improvements. How can I roll back to the previous version?",,,
2015,5,"100% works, great results and very close to the web version which is rare. Sometimes prices are a tad old but not often and after selecting it is revised so all good  :-) New app update is a little more complicated, would be nice to swipe along dates instead of having to go back a screen and reselect... Food for thought!",,,
2015,1,"Who in their right mind signed this off, what's worse is that despite 100's of negative comments you continue to have this as your current version.  Listen to what we are all SAYING,  and put it back to how it was.  I BET THE NEW APP FORMAT WAS DESIGNED BY A BLOODY GRADUATE",,,
2015,5,Sky scanner proved to be the best agent app in pocket. Helps planning easier. You helped airlines and people's life easier and economical. Defined in best way possible. I guess rating might cross 5 if any new updates are coming!,,,
2015,2,"A dumbed down version of the site. Multiple screens to select routes, too much info on flights, taking up more screen room. It's just not worth the effort when there are better apps out there.",,,
2015,2,Had to edit my review with the new update.  Dissapointed that the option to search for flights leaving before a certain time is gone. I only like to fly mornings and I cannot filter it to search for these now. Why remove a feature?,,,
2015,2,Don't like the look of the latest version. Bring back the last one. Fix the bugs! Direct flights option keeps on turning off! Annoying.,,,
2015,4,"twice uninstalled and reinstalled.To no avail.  Then I cleared all data, stopped the app running, de-installed and re-installed. And .. it seems to work  Have sent at least 5 crash reports to Google.  Impressed by your fast reaction.  Will change the rating.",,,
2015,3,"The best feature of this app is the lowest price line on the bar graph, and now that has gone! Little green dots tell you very little whereas the lowest price line on the bar graph is a great visual price comparison.  Please bring it back.",,,
2015,1,The new update ¬£439  .. old way of looking is ¬£49 to look for cheaper flights on different days.  This means it no different than any other holiday company now AVOID or be ripped off,,,
2015,1,"Before you could search by the whole month and see prices for each day a flight was available. None of this anymore, preferred the old version!!! Uninstalling immediately!!!",,,
2015,5,Guy at the phone shop told me about it and I've been a happy customer for about 3 years. Always find a great deal... Just great for browsing for vacations sometimes as well.,,,
2015,1,"Used Skyscanner app for years. Its been updated and is awful now. It doesn't flow at all and I don't like where you have to type your ""to"" and ""from"" in now either it is now badly designed.",,,
2015,1,"I know tickets prices fluctuate, but this is a very bad estimation compared to my previous non update. It shows 299 at first, then after clicking into it, shows 495",,,
2015,2,"I previously rated this app as a 5 because it was easy to read and clear and concise, but used the new updated version today and I really don't like the new layout.",,,
2015,5,"Thanks to the new design/surface, navigating the app has become much easier and new features have been added, that help you get where you want faster.",,,
2015,1,"Used to have, after you input dates and destination, a useful graph search so you could see day by day the different prices workout having to manually change days every time.  Gone now.",,,
2015,2,I used an older version on ios and just changed to android and this app is just not as clear and simple to use. I now only use skyscanner in browser now,,,
2015,2,Used to love Skyscanner and always use the app. This new update has overcomplicated and made it harder to search for flights.,,,
2015,4,Good app. The new vgn is lil complicated but as soon as u get used to it its fine ... Keep up the good work guys ..,,,
2015,5,"Easy to use, awesome search features, saved searches, alerts, and the cheapest flights on the web! I've booked several flights on this.",,,
2015,4,It was easier before. I wish you update it back to the old interface and thank you for amazing application.,,,
2015,4,Goede tool. Maar er is soms een commisie boven op de prijs van bvb Ryanair.,,,
2015,2,Says you can search all flights without specifics dates. It's just a typical flight search. Undownloading. Waste of space.,,,
2015,2,I don't want a sleeping app to send me messages?! If i use it i know what i search for and an app that records my searches and sends me info is not helping!,,,
2015,1,App kept crashing and couldn't log in too my mobile banking because of this app. Also not as good now the pricing graph has changed,,,
2015,5,So very easy to use.. I have the best deals nothing hidden everytime.,,,
2015,2,"Impossible to find anything! The monthly view is crap, please, go back to the previous version!",,,
2015,4,I would like to see More Airlines... I noticed that Southwest Airlines isn't on here I don't recall Delta... But I could be wrong,,,
2015,5,Great app. It is easy to use and has a good environment. But I think it is better to include carrier information in detail section of each flight.,,,
2015,4,Best deals on the app are no longer available. Otherwise good!,,,
2015,5,"This is my ""go to"" flight  travel site. Really  impressed with the deals I can find.",,,
2015,5,Found flights that before... would take hours.... thanks,,,
2015,5,New app is still better. Provides great options to find the best flight,,,
2015,1,Worst app. If cleartrip gives for 2500rs it gives for 7000. Too costly. Never try.,,,
2015,5,I m never disappointed with this apps. Always shows the best deals available,,,
2015,5,Found a flight from Chicago to Panama for $100! Cant beat that price. This app is amazing,,,
2015,5,Pretty useful app. It offers you an easier travelling. Loving it!,,,
2015,5,"Best app so far in its category. Cheapest price, easy to use. I love this app...",,,
2015,4,A great and convenient app. Its my goto app when checking on available international flights before going to specific airline web site.,,,
2015,1,App has been changed. Harder to use. Won't use again.,,,
2015,1,The first time i say this for any app... The new app is all buggy and non responsive.,,,
2015,5,I can not believe how cheap tickets are!!! I'm going back home to Ukraine in may and I'm ecstatic about prices!!! I will save over 400$!!! Best app ever!!!,,,
2015,1,I was forced to download this app in order to use the free WiFi of the airport. Nice way to pump up your download rates.,,,
2015,3,Why do my friends that have this app in different countries get cheaper flights when in England all the flights are over ¬£100 + more expensive ????,,,
2015,1,Went through the whole process and at the end the price bumps up 300 bucks.  What a waste of time.,,,
2015,3,I need a multi-city flight and that's not possible with this app... Otherwise 5 stars!,,,
2015,1,This was a good app but it doesn't work anymore when searching for full months.,,,
2015,5,Sempre uso esse aplicativo depois vou no site da empresa direto. Deveria haver a possibilidade dele avisar no pr√≥prio celular a respeito das ofertas que procuramos.,,,
2015,5,I can easily find the best flights availabile here. I no longer need to book via agency to get the most flexible flights.,,,
2015,4,"Raising from 2 to 4 stars after last update, still their is room to improve keep it up",,,
2015,5,"I always check skyscanner to compare the prices, sometimes even get cheaper price than airline directly. Love it....",,,
2015,3,"Do check the legitimacy of the websites which offer the lowest rates, as the reviews of those websites are worst !!",,,
2015,5,If you're looking for cheap flights this app is a necessity. It scans for cheap flights and does all the work.,,,
2015,5,Simple... perfect... useful.... there is no more to say!,,,
2015,1,New 'upgrade' strips out convenient features rendering it useless to me.,,,
2015,5,Always find prices better than Orbitz. Love the price alerts too that you can set.,,,
2015,4,It woukd  perfect I could consult several destinations at the same time.,,,
2015,3,Only issue is it cannot check the prices for long term search,,,
2015,5,I can now easily find flights and places to go. Destination Anywhere is icing on the cake.,,,
2015,4,Give me good information about the price and time to all flights,,,
2015,5,Very easy to use and most importantly it's pretty easy to see the big picture in terms of flights availability across several days.,,,
2015,5,"I just need a multy trips option otherwise , it's easy to use, fast, and accurate .",,,
2015,5,The app has recently updated and it shows more info about the flight search.  Good job!,,,
2015,5,got all details of flights with out any travel agent...really nice app..,,,
2015,5,"Great app, quite useful features, especially seeing what days and months are cheapest for a particular location!",,,
2015,5,Easy to use and accesses airlines that usually don't show up on other sites.,,,
2015,5,"Easy and straight forward to use, that's all you need",,,
2015,5,The best application for travel i did use it to book my flights and im really satisfied.,,,
2015,5,The simple and user friendly design of the app makes it easy for the users to access the for their needs.,,,
2015,5,"Love to use this app, it is very helpfull and user friendly!!!",,,
2015,5,Very convenient to check schedule and price under one roof.,,,
2015,5,Excellence in search... It looks so easy to book ticket...,,,
2015,5,Could compare various options and find the cheapest flights available!,,,
2015,5,This is the best app for ticketing specially for those who love to travel,,,
2015,4,"Pratique, utile. √áa donne envie de partir en vacances",,,
2015,5,Guarantee to land you the cheapest flight to your destination.,,,
2015,5,I like that it searches other airlines like Southwest unlike other apps,,,
2015,5,Generally find that prices are a few pounds less than other sites for the same flights.,,,
2015,5,Great app to get latest flights update and cheapest flights,,,
2015,5,M encanta l opci√≥ qualsevol lloc qualsevol data i enlla√ßar vols al voltant del m√≥n. Volem?,,,
2015,5,"Whenever try to open, it turns off by itself. Uninstalling...",,,
2015,5,llevo usando Skyscanner por lo menos cuatro a√±os y siempre me ha funcionado de maravilla,,,
2015,1,"This is the first time I have ever rated an app but the new updates to skyscanner have made me so upset that I felt compelled to do so. I used to be a massive fan and used the skyscanner app all the time. I've just had the latest update and it is dreadful. The interface is not at all user friendly and I can't figure out what is going on. It makes me want to cry, I loved the old app and used it constantly. Now I can't use skyscanner anymore because this new update makes it impossible to understand.",,,
2015,2,"I like the skyscanner, helped me a lot. However, they do associate with airline agency companies who rip people off. I had to learn the hard way with Bookairfare. They canceled my flight and didn't give me my money or flight. Everytime I called Bookairfare, they would disconnect and claim it as phone disconnection. Anyway when using this, research the airline agency you booking with before giving your money. Skyscanner sometimes associates with bad airline agencies.",,,
2015,1,"With the release of the ""new"" app I've changed my review from 5 stars to 1. It's not presenting any new information, but the new layout is confusing and annoying, and where is my ""whole month"" setting with the easy to view chart gone?. Also, have you guys tried using this version on a cellphone in landscape mode, it now shows bugger all unless I rotate back to portrait. Give me the old one back, this one is crap.",,,
2015,1,"You say you've been listening, but not sure who to, possibly the developers who made such a mess of this. Please, please, please give us the option to download old version, that is intuitive, easy to use and actually works before everyone follows and starts using other apps. Keep the new version for people that like something pretty that's next to useless, but let us get hold of the old version as well, it was the best travel app out there.",,,
2015,1,Interface for older one is better than this. The update made it difficult to search and less friendly. Hopefully you will make it more user-friendly and do not look so complex. Please put back the exact price in the graph. The way you made it make me confused. 8[,,,
2015,1,"It's not that it's now dreadful or unusable. It's just that the previous version was absolutely perfect. Why would you even think such a radical overhaul of an app with so many 5 star reviews was ever needed? You should just change it back to the better looking and easier to use version, and get rid of whoever signed off this embarrassing episode. I look forward to receiving the same copy-paste response from Skyscanner as all the other negative reviews. You know. The one with the link that you can't click.",,,
2015,1,"APP UPDATED: Sky Scanner app update doesn't allow the feature that set it apart from the rest, the ability to search flights without indicating a departure/return dates. I use to recommend this app due to this AWESOME tool, but not anymore. It's okay, plenty other flight apps out there.",,,
2015,1,"So I never bother to review apps and this review is not so much about the app, which works fine, but the fact that skyscanner seems to be so uselessly stupid that it can only find flights that are at least twice as expensive as any other sources. And no, it's not that I'm only seeing one way instead of return, it is that skyscanner is a piece of manure. Don't waste your time, go somewhere else",,,
2015,1,"The new design & layout on the latest version is incredibly hard to use & very unintuitive, making for a poor user experience. The strength of Skyscanner used to be its simplicity. And where is the option to search flights across an entire month without specifying an exact date?!",,,
2015,2,This is my prefered app since a long time but the old interface was much easier and showing same info.  Also filtering on direct flights is no more available at first screen but should wait long time till all flights are loaded then to filter unlike the older version.     Hope to support multi destination flight,,,
2015,1,"As a user who uses this app a lot, i was first surprised because the new design looked nicer. Bur after 1 week of use i am shocked by how complicated and not intuitive it is. Its a clear step behind. Please bring the old version immediately!",,,
2015,1,"DONT UPGRADE!! The new skyscanner app is rubbish. It doesn't tell you price variations on monthly view. You can't open multiple pages to check different legs of journey. It is a completely different app from the older , more simple but more complex app. I just wish i never updated to the new version. And i cant find the old one. Such a shame. From best app to worst in a 30 second upgrade. Shame on you program develpers. üòùüòùüòù",,,
2015,3,"The new update made things look pretty good. I like the new layout, the new front-page which records recent searches. The comparison table though, has become worse. It certainly looks nice, but is much harder to find, and does not display the prices, and doesn't have a scale to let me know what the price difference is.",,,
2015,3,"I liked the old version more for reasons others already mentioned and am waiting for a better update. Features like search without date, parallel searching are gone. App is redundant. Prices first indicated sometimes are not shown after ""second"" search.",,,
2015,2,"**The recent update has destroyed a trusted source. Prices change when you select BOOK, sometimes doubling in price. Choice of airlines greatly reduced. No option to delete multiple airlines. Devastated as this was my sole one stop for flights...",,,
2015,1,What happened to this perfectly running and intuitive app? I tried to get this new version under control before I posted my rating here. It's just confusing and everything else than intuitive. Everything takes so much more clicks than before and it is just not possible to get the benefits I loved so much in the old version. Please... Where can I download the old version?,,,
2015,1,"I have always used Skyscanner to plan my travels but the new release simply doesn't deliver. The filter on direct flights doesn't work anymore, it's no longer possible to search without dates and the country view is not as sleek. Can we go back to the old version?",,,
2015,3,"With the update you can no longer search for direct flights only, which means you get a long list of flights taking 35 hours for a 4 hour journey. Also the interface is not so user friendly. Another case of an upgrade not improving anything.",,,
2015,1,"Don't install it. You will be disappointed. Not convenient, unclear application: unclear information about nouber of changes force to read text (no circle icons),small airline logos, small fonts,  absence of combined lines filter, absence of possibility to manage recent search, no possibility to sort recent search, a lot of free unused space on screen but small fonts, ridiculous flight ratings, taking lines. The best example of that, how to change clear and convenient app into unclear and unconvenient one.",,,
2015,2,"This app used to be amazing, but now, for some reason, it's completely inoperable. Searching anytime/anywhere flights leaves me with a total of 7 odd countries to choose from, and even then it grants 0 flight data for anything. That's the biggest issue: NO FLIGHT DATA WHATSOEVER....FOR ANYTHING! Giving it 2 stars only because I know how cool the app used to be. Hopefully the day will come when I can open this app again and actually be able to use it.",,,
2015,1,Go back to the old version. The functionality of it doesn't work. This new version is not user friendly. Why change something that was so awesome before. Most people are saying the same thing why change it if it isn't broke. I probably find another app to use now. üò¢,,,
2015,1,"What happened to being able to simply select where you wanted to go and scroll thought dates and prices, took me ages to find the price bar charts, then you select the dates, press done, and nothing happens, then you spend ages figuring out you need to search. Why would you select dates and do nothing? And the results are so unclear! The old app was great, if it ain't broke....",,,
2015,1,"Downloaded it, the signed up for new account. Verified email, the online site nor the app will acknowledge my login. Unable to verify if the app works as I can't get past the login screen.",,,
2015,1,Awful. I adore skyscanner and the old interface was perfect for really squeezing the details and getting the best deal. This new interface is disastrous and clumpy and actually limits your overall vision. Not good. Gutted. :( Please reverse!,,,
2015,1,"Bring back the old design. It was easy to use, allowed you to search flights costs over the month easily and quickly and was much, much easier to navigate. Won't be using the app until it's been developed. Love the site but will be using the desktop instead.",,,
2015,2,"Really very disappointed :( the old version is faraway better than this rabish , all good in this new one is only design and graphics but for use the old one was very easy and simple I hope that you get back the old version + the new design. Sorry i would like to give 5 stars but not for this virsion .thx",,,
2015,1,"Used to be my go to app for all my travel needs. Not anymore,  the update has rendered it all but useless. Too much going on, time to look for a new search application.",,,
2015,1,"Used to be the best search engine for flight prices, but the new update is dreadful. Previous version was perfect and simple, but the update is overly complex, the UI is cluttered and the extra features are unnecessary and clumsy. Massive shame but will be uninstalling.",,,
2015,4,Thank you for your reply. At first I couldn't see the month view with the bar chart. It is easily missed. It's true the new interface seems less intuitive but at least that's there.,,,
2015,1,"This app was absolutly  amazing but now with those new updates,ruinned all application. It's not that easy to use. I would rather go on proper websites to look for flights as this application is only waste of my time.",,,
2015,1,An update from the end of October messed up the whole app for me. I updated a new version today and it still not working.  All my flight searches always come up with ZERO results.  Galaxy S5.,,,
2015,2,This app was the best used it all the time! Now with the upgrade i think im going to delete it and find a different one its unusable and no point in it as can't look through the grid and find the cheapest day or anything which is why i loved it. Should have left it how it was!,,,
2015,2,"was great! but now... still crashes when I select ""everywhere"" as destination or try and select dates for other destinations. please advise and let me know if u need logs. submitted request on request page.",,,
2015,5,"I just needed to explore the app more. I was initially disappointed but the developer pointed out how to get the ""old"" view I want. I'm quite happy now. Thanks!",,,
2015,4,"A very fast and user friendly interface, really like it. But on android, the app appears as 'Flights' not Skyscanner so it's not always placed where you expect it in the app drawer.",,,
2015,1,It is so confusing now to select flights and dates! Why have you tried to fix something that was never broken in the first place..? Please can you restore the old version!! What were you thinking..? Terrible!!,,,
2015,1,"Please go back to older version, new version sucks, you cant find any flight,  there is no month calender. I remove this app until it gets back to normal.",,,
2015,1,"I used to love and recommend this app to anyone who would listen but they have gotten rid of the most useful function. A bar chart saying the dates across an extended period of time was much more useful than green, yellow and red dots which you have to memorize the amounts they relate to because as you scroll down through the months the drop down ""colour coded price key"" doesn't follow.can't explain seriously enough....if it isn't broken, don't fix it!!!!",,,
2015,5,"Haven't used it for quite some times. Great functionality like the original version with more great features, faster, & friendlier interfaces. Keep it up!",,,
2015,1,The old version was better. You dont have a statistic of flight price per days. Put the option +/- 3 days in search,,,
2015,4,Prices are great! The only problem I got was at check out. When it was time to pay keeps saying it's an error but I call the number they provide and got it done! Otherwise I would have given a 5 stars,,,
2015,1,I can still get my work done but requires some getting used to. Not a fan of change for change's sake though. CORRECTIONS: compared it with the old app and I can get better results much more easily previously,,,
2015,4,I like the app but i do not like the monthly graph the colours are to light and its hard to read. The old monthly graph was better. And the graph had airline selection filter.,,,
2015,1,"What used to be so easy and clear to use is now a garbled mess. So much empty space in initial start screen, no sign of reverse direction switch. Text too small. Old app was so much better",,,
2015,5,Cheapest way to fly. I have been using their website for a couple years before they came out with this app. So happy they did!!!! Thanks for everything guys,,,
2015,5,Like to browse whole months by price which you could before update.. seems more of a hassle to find what you are looking for...which is mainly cheap flights :(,,,
2015,2,The app is called 'Flights'. Took me ages to find it and pulled my hair out in the process. I have over 300 apps. Why not call it Skyscanner?,,,
2015,1,Not working on my sony z ultra. Error- skyscanner has stopped. Please and please give us the old version back.,,,
2015,5,"Helps me find super cheap fair,  does not save cookies like webapges do to jack up the price each time you search. Going to London from cental USA for $731  in two more weeks. Easy to use, love it.",,,
2015,1,Want the old version back... reset my tablet and redownloaded the app to find its now rubbish.... where can i find the old version.,,,

2015,5,"Good app to find cheap flight in months. He has also have price alert, if the price is changes you got email. Must have app :)",,,

2015,5,Still using this app on multiple occasions since 2013. I find it accurate and reliable without any hassles or fuss. ... Well done You,,,
2015,1,The previous version was so much better! It was so easy to use. Please bring back the old one.,,,
2015,1,Why ruin a brilliant app with this dreadful new interface. I have booked many flights through skyscanner but unless I can find a way to get back to the old interface I won't be booking anymore.,,,
2015,5,"It is quite handy! Next thing probably is to be able to make your own flight, mixing from 2 combinations and having a quotation. :-)",,,
2015,2,"Please make color dot to indicate price ranges distinguishable, colorblind and very confusing when can't tell apart colors (red green orange) make yellow red blue...",,,

2015,5,"The layout is beautiful, the search works great, and it puts a new twist on how you look to travel.",,,

2015,5,"Hi, I just downloaded it and notice that you reply comments and that is awesome. Thanks.",,,
2015,3,Flights info from China is a bit of messy. Do not use this app if you're searching flights departing from China.,,,

2015,1,"I don't like the new version,  I miss the old version",,,
2015,5,I love how easy and straight forward the process is,,,
2015,2,"I have been using this app for long time. A very helpful app but the the latest update is bad. Two issues:  1. Even I select the direct flight option in the start date and return date, the search result still displays all results. I need to click the filter again in order to display the direct flight only.  2. The second one is more annoying issue. In the older version, I was able to see all prices around my planned dates by clicking the Chart symbol. In the latest version, I only see the price of particular date I have selected in the Chart. In order to locate if there is any cheaper tickets around my planned date, I have to click each date around my date manually to see the pop up price. I would prefer to view prices around my planned date without clicking each date. Is there any way I can install the previous version of this app.   3. The Chart symbol only exists in the start and return date screen instead of existing on the result screen. I would prefer to see the Chart symbol exists in both screens which is a more efficient way to locate cheaper tickets.4. On Skyscanner website, why there is no Chart function which allows users to view prices around planned date?",,,
2015,1,"The update put too many menu clicks in the way of the prices. When I look for flights I like to quickly change parameters and sliders. You've made it more convoluted. The colour coding system is pointless as you won't be changing flight dates to weeks into the future. You could safely assume that people know prices of flights will rocket within a month of departure date. Enable us to search by price. A nice feature one of your rivals has is to search by budget, 'where will ¬£200 get me?'. Please try again.",,,
2015,4,"It's always nice to keep an app updated with the latest design trends but please keep all the functionality: 1) ability to swap departure/arrival airports was so handy in case of multi leg journeys. 2) the month view needs to be easier to retrieve, had to read all the reviews here to get it. 3) the results screen is so pale that everything looks similar! There should be clear separation between options and ability to choose different outbound and inbound flights while combining results.",,,
2015,1,"Do you think serious that you make a app better if you put some flags a and pictures on the app? The view is to coulurful, poor and slow service, no price indication on weeks chart.... I think I'm talking for everyone here that's a better idea if you undo the app to the old version ...  I'll definitely no longer use so long as it is so shifty.. Thank you for the update Skyscanner not",,,
2015,1,Is this app supposed to look like the pictures? Because the one I've just installed looks nothing like it. That was the simpler version that thankfully I still have on my iPhone.  Seems I miss the option to quickly reverse the to and from destinations to search for one way flights quickly if it's easier to do that. And it doesn't look as clean and simple as before,,,
2015,1,"Why provide an upgrade that removed all the great features of the old app.  I can not figure out how to have multiple pages open to search different options for different routes,  can not work out how to get the list of all flight options on day of choice across all airlines from cheapest to most expensive on preferred day, and most importantly I  it was great in the old version on how to the price for each day on a sliding day calendar.  The photos still show these old options but seem to be gone. Very sad",,,
2015,1,"Skyscanner was my favourite app to search for cheap flights. I especially loved the monthly charts to look for the cheapest day, but now it is quite useless. First I started in landscape mode , as the previous version allowed to see a full month for departure day and return day. The new version only displays a few days at the same time and I was totally stuck selecting the departure and return date. Finally I gave up, switched to portrait mode. Then the second bar chart showed up. But worse than before ...",,,
2015,1,"Please back to old version. Or let users choose to use old version or new one. Skyscanner use to be fast, easy and nice. I am a brazilian backpacker I had travel every continent almost 50 countries always using this app. I love skyscanner. But now not so cool to use. Please let us keep using old version.",,,
2015,1,"Dear Skyscanner management, are you sure your ""app team"" wasn't paid by your competitors to come up with an ""update"" that completely ruins the user-experience and drives away the majority of your users?

2015,4,"New application looks much nicer than before and seems to perform a lot better too. Unfortunately it's become more difficult to navigate.

Thanks, guys!",,,
2015,4,"Love the ap, but have been caught out, brought a return flight but it had baggage to my destination but none to come back with and cost us alot extra. We didn't realise until after we had brought the deal and we could not upgrade baggage because agent said contact airline -airline said call agent... so hoping update in ap shows if baggage is included in price.. and is easy to find out.. Thanks",,,
2015,1,Flights are never available at the price displayed and the websites that you get directed to are very hard to deal with. One only had a $2 per minute phone line to try and get a flight changed. Only use this app to find what routes are available then deal directly with the airline for peace of mind.,,,
2015,1,"Very hard to navigate. Also price quoted often drastically changes once you click on the link to book. Poor option to flex flights and dates. Also if pick one date to fly, how then can that price go up or down by 300% depending on the flight back which were both listed as a similar price.",,,
2015,5,"Most flight searching apps are a down-graded version of the website that it is based on,¬† with important features like +/- days and flexible searches left out. This app, on the other hand, may be even better and more flexible than the site itself.

Needless to say,¬† I was excited to find this app!",,,

2015,4,"Hey, I like the new look, and im sure I'll get used to the new functionality of the app. Can you let me know if you intend to bring multi-city flights back? This was one of the most useful standout features of the previous version. I don't have much use for the app without it.",,,

2015,1,"Please, how do I find the old version?!  A. From start to flight, many more clicks than before.  B. Colour coded price indicator extremely inaccurate!  C.  Harder to figure out where the cheaper flights are.  With the old bar graph system I could see clearly which flights were higher and lower and select accordingly.  D. Much slower.

2015,2,"There is too much going on in the screen. The last version was better as you could search for the whole month and it showed clearer results. The colour coding on the calendar only gives you a price range not an exact price. For me, I prefer the older version.",,,
2015,1,"I actually like the new design of the app. It's a shame that it doesn't work though. I search for flights and when I try and tap on a month, the application just crashes. I've sent in a bug report but this is quite a glaring problem with the app I have no choice but to 1 star.",,,
2015,4,"It's short way from ""must have"" app to useless app. Update: restart of my phone solved the issue. Now I see all flights with details. Only 4 stars because of this issue.",,,
2015,1,"The new version is pretty bad. I can't search a full month anymore, nor do multiple searches/tabs at once. Those were the best features...",,,
2015,3,"I am very happy with the search capabilities as they led me to an opportunity I would have otherwise missed.  I am upset though because your app description indicates no fees.  Since your app bounced me to Bravofly, I ended up paying approximately $30 in fees that I wouldn't have had if I had booked directly.",,,
2015,2,This is a disaster. For years used Skyscanner and now can't seem to make head or tail of it. Old version was simple with clicking onto what day you wanted and see price comparisons of near by days. Why have you made it unappealing?,,,
2015,1,New update unfortunately sucks... People who use it frequency you can see that they all complain. This huge brain ceo who had that idea is genius.... Keep going...,,,
2015,4,"Material Design works good. But please make the ""search"" button as fab and strech the passenger information to full width. Would work perfect on this UI!",,,
2015,1,"Since the upgrade,  the app doesn't work on my Sony Z Ultra at all. Disappointed as I used to use this app for all my flight bookings. Have had to install Kayak",,,
2015,2,What happened to multiple windows? Also the new graph for viewing price fluctuations is horrible. Please put it back into calendar view vs the current linear view.,,,
2015,1,"This new version of Skyscanner is absolutely awful. It used to be really easy to tweak your search criteria to get to the best deal, now it's really hard work - will not be using it anymore.",,,
2015,5,"The new app is absolutely amazing in material design. It works so well, gives me all the features I could ever want, it's stable and what's more, it's beautiful. This app has to be editor's choice very very soon.",,,
2015,3,I take back what I said . The new update is OK . Just the layout is different.  But I do prefer the way it was . High lighting the expensive months is good . All flights have gone through the roof in the West side of Oz.,,,
2015,2,"So much harder to use since the update, it might look better, but it's much harder to use. I guess it might save me some money no longer making so many impulse flight purchases, now it's much harder to find them.",,,
2015,1,You've ruined your own app. Either revert back to the previous incarnation or watch your entire user base disappear. Truly terrible.,,,
2015,1,This used to be my go to app for travel.. Told everyone about it. But the new design is horrible and I will need to rethink what app i use. Not sure what focus group was used by the company that suggested this  revision.,,,
2015,1,"This used to be a good useful app and worked brilliantly, now it's basically un usable absolutely terrible update.  Which numpty designed and signed this rubbish off",,,
2015,5,I really love the new design. It's more helpful please don't change it back to the previous one. Thanks alot for such a lovely app :),,,
2015,2,It is so hard to use after the update. No more scrolling by which dates are cheapeat even when I have selected the 'anytime' selection. I love the old version.,,,
2015,1,"The last app was brilliant, this new version is terrible. I won't ever use it again. Have you been taken over??",,,
2015,5,"Have been using from past few weeks. The app is much better than the web version, mainly because of the push notifications. Neat and friendly UI.",,,
2015,1,"I just can't be bothered using it anymore, this latest update really screws everything up, I'm looking for another app now, one that is user friendly.",,,
2015,4,"I love your new ui & ux guys. But why you separated fligt & hotel service :( . too much for me, i have to download many apps on the phone.",,,
2015,1,You had a good one such a shame. Now looking for another. Jan Cooper. Found Cheap flights app easier to use & cheaper. (-:,,,
2015,2,Don't like the layout..should have kept it as it was.... can't look at individual days and prices anymore... harder to use!!,,,
2015,3,"Don't get me wrong, this app is still one of the best flight search apps, but what happened to the bar chart of prices, or the ability to change travel agent? Other than that, I've booked just about every flight I've taken for years with the help of Skyscanner, and its been a massive help.",,,
2015,5,Great app! Love this new function.. We can check now on which date the flight will be cheaper ;) thanks,,,
2015,1,Crashes every time on selecting date or month.The previous version was rock solid but this update or new version keeps crashing so please fix it.,,,
2015,2,How you can destroy a fantastic useful app with a totally idiotic new version is hard to believe. Mainly guilty are those who approved this!,,,
2015,1,The latest version is trash.  How can I get my multiple search Windows back?  The older version was superior and easier to navigate...,,,
2015,5,"I like the new UI, especially the widget which I look at every day now has a scroll function. I always use Skyscanner to search for my flights, brilliant app",,,
2015,5,"Love the new update, it's much easier to find a cheap flight and the app looks amazing. Great work, really.",,,
2015,1,Previous version so much simpler and easy to use. Old saying if it ain't broke don't fix it comes to mind!!!,,,
2015,1,Confusing and pointless update. I will be uninstalling if this isn't rectified. What the hell was wrong with the old version?!,,,
2015,1,"Have deleted now after update, was the best flight site now confusing and useless!! Totally not using anymore",,,
2015,1,"This version is awful. So hard to navigate, while trying way too hard to be stylish. The old version was absolutely perfect.",,,
2015,5,"This app is the best for this task and has the best usability for a mobile app. In fact, the showed prices does not have the best prices, but the differences are little and the agility offered by this app compensates it.",,,
2015,1,It's so harder to use after the recent update. ... also giving the option of multiple city flights will be better,,,
2015,5,But i prefered the old version a bit more because it was easier to navigate through the app... Please include advanced search options like multiple destinations,,,
2015,5,If ever there was a program to offer the quickest views for finding flights with the most dynamic filters then this is the program for you!  Give it shot and see what you have  to gain! :)  Enjoy!,,,
2015,5,"The update has made this app more informative than before, whatever you want you get in this app. A must for every traveller.",,,
2015,1,The new version of sky scanner is awful. It's not convenient for use at all. You made it complicated and uncomfortable.,,,
2015,3,Does what its intended to do but why remove the Cebu Pacific pricing? Would have been better if you could see all the carriers you wanted in one app,,,
2015,1,Destroys the ease of use that the first one had.  Harder to search whole month and user interface is ugly minimalistic,,,
2015,1,Any chance you can add a classic view button so every one can switch back to the better version off this app thanks,,,
2015,2,"Why is it when an update is applied you end up with a poor quality looking app, why not just make the update and leave the rest as it is if you can't enhance the look of it, don't try and fix something that isn't broken!",,,
2015,1,Should be 0 star. Awful layout colours and fonts.  Sack the designer. Won't use any more.,,,
2015,5,Realised ive been tipped off for flights in the past. This app gives you all possible flight to and from ur destination and best prices. Highly recommend,,,
2015,4,I liked how easy and fast I could search for cheap flights. You guys need to change it back to the old version,,,
2015,1,"I've been using the app for years, until the last update where you've mixed up the basic whole month overview as well as the airports view from the whole country.",,,
2015,5,No issues with the latest update and actually like the new layout. Use it frequently to find the best fares.,,,
2015,5,Where is the charts. It was the best feature in the app. Could you please put it back.,,,
2015,1,This used to be such a good app. Since the update. Its crap. Uninstalled it.,,,
2015,2,Very  hard and useless after update skyscanner is nice application before but new version is very critical please fix it,,,
2015,5,Great search features like 'go anywhere from where you are'. Simple to use but powerful.,,,
2015,1,It wasn't broke so why try fix it? Latest update is brutal and will be deleted imminently!,,,
2015,1,So many useless UI elements. Nothing of use. Will uninstall,,,
2015,2,New update made a great app so confusing functionally! Aesthetics is secondary!,,,
2015,2,"Awful since update.Every time i pick direct flights it comes up as 2 stops, nearly made a big mistake that could of cost me!",,,
2015,1,"I have used skyscanner for 10 years but now it has changed I think I'll go back to searching websites myself, terrible app",,,
2015,1,Why oh why change what works? what else can I find? Truly awful experience/ app,,,
2015,5,"Weather you're a frequent flyer or just fly once a year this app is a must have, you'll save so much money and time searching for affordable flights.",,,
2015,4,"I tried several sites for fare tracking, but this app was able to generate many combinations of flights to find the cheapest roundtrip fares.",,,
2015,2,The new update is awful. Trying to compare different destinations and dates is too awkward and clumsy.,,,
2015,2,I have to say this update is a disappointment. I loved the previous one because how easy it was.,,,
2015,1,Latest version causes too much crashes. It always needs a force stop.,,,
2015,1,Was a great app until the update. Why mess with a good thing?,,,
2015,1,"Sadly doesn't work on a Sony running 5.1.1. Now forced to use Momondo, which does work",,,
2015,5,It's a great useful app. The prices shown on both the website and the app are the same unlike before. Air tickets for great prices!,,,
2015,2,Update is far more difficult to navigate around. Not user friendly,,,
2015,1,"May look pretty, but useless compared to old. Why fix something that ain't broke.",,,
2015,5,"Quick, efficient, redlly handy. Do you want the cheapest flight on THAT date? You can do it. It's so cool.",,,
2015,5,Good and useful app. New version's font too small.  üò¢,,,
2015,4,Its a awesome app for flights it will be more better if us can even book hotels and cab from here only,,,
2015,3,The block type monthly price graphic was so much easier to read. The new rounded edges are misleading.,,,
2015,2,"Old app excellent, new one pathetically poorly designed. Please put it back the way it was.",,,
2015,1,"Used to be very user friendly now so complicated, takes time to read and understand, used to just glance at it and knew what was what.",,,
2015,1,Bring back the old UI. The latest version is not good.,,,
2015,1,"There was nothing wrong with the old one.why change...,if its not broke don't fix it",,,
2015,2,"New one is unusable, though last release fixed some bugs, still I'd prefer to use old UI.",,,
2015,5,"Absolutely ******* fantastic. Love it. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I ******* would!",,,
2015,4,Looking for flights is hard.  This gave me a wider choice selection and more airports to choose from,,,
2016,4,All possible destinations under one roof.. Great App for booking domestic and international air tickets,,,
2015,3,I cannot find my booking. It is terrible there is no such function.,,,
2015,1,It went from a simple app to super complicated and hard to use I don't  think I will be using this anymore,,,
2015,4,Good & more information. What we are expected get full with complete details.,,,
2015,5,Fab - didnt work that well for me pre upgrade on mobile - but now great for point to point flights. Head to head with Google flights.,,,
2015,4,Love the fact that you can see the cheapest flights rather than destination!,,,
2015,1,In my note4 I can't book my ticket just shows price plz fix it,,,
2015,1,New version crashes all the time and is not easy to use.,,,
2015,1,Force closes on date selection (have reported the force close).,,,
2015,1,pleasee where can i downliad the old version ... ??? the new one is one big psycho :D,,,
2015,5,Best App to find and book the cheapest flights.... Travel Around the world ... Freedom from Travel Agents...,,,
2015,1,"After I selected traveling dates and clicked Done, instead of showing the flights, it returns to previous page....",,,
2015,1,Looks awful. Feels awful. Is awful. Unusable. Please roll back.,,,
2015,2,"I like the multi windows search and the prices shown in a full month feature, they are gone now.",,,
2015,1,The Skyscanner is the best search for flights but the new application it's awful,,,
2015,1,It kept telling me that there is no flight available even though i have already chance the date..,,,
2015,5,"Always use this. But to book, I have better luck going directly to carrier website.",,,
2015,5,This prices are great! Can't wait to book my next trip,,,
2015,5,Love the app. My first choice when need to buy flight tickets.,,,
2015,1,Brilliant app however new upgrade is terrible and ruined it.,,,
2015,5,Love the app but not really trust the agents based on some bad reviews.,,,
2015,2,This app does not show Cebu Pacific flights. I have to use other app just to compare all the flights,,,
2015,5,Superb for those who luvs traveling.  Never stop using it since install.,,,
2015,4,I have reviewed the information and the price reflect the true market price.,,,
2015,4,Can't see prices by date to see which date has the lowest price.,,,
2015,5,I use Skyscanner first for all my flights. Nothing better.,,,
2015,1,Best app for future travel n best to analyse the trip,,,
2015,5,"To put filters when searching for ""everywhere"" so the price that comes out are the relevant price.",,,
2015,5,Just need away to use air miles collected from past flights???       And also allow you to plan multiple flights???,,,
2015,5,Easy to use app. All the information I need in one place.,,,
2015,5,Great app all you need for the best price on flights..,,,
2015,5,"Excellent app for finding deals as it is always live,  unlike some others üòä",,,
2015,5,I am finding the new version to be very useful...I m still new,,,
2015,1,Just crashes whenever everywhere is clicked as a destination.,,,
2015,5,This app is super easy to use and is great for comparing flights and prices from a variety of sellers.,,,
2015,5,Everything I need.. not for low IQ .. Good for techyüòÜüòÜüòÜ,,,
2015,5,I get to discover some amazingly cheap flights to exotic destinations with SkyScanner,,,
2015,5,"Excellent app, but the new format a little confusing.",,,
2015,1,A brilliant app utterly ruined by a needless redesign.,,,
2015,5,Really enjoy to have the option for looking for the best and lowest fares!,,,
2015,5,"Love it, though I would like to have push notification for prices",,,
2015,5,Correct fare showing without any additional cost I guarantee,,,
2015,5,All relevant information  at your fingertips easy to use,,,
2015,5,Good program very easy for use and good prices . Thanks,,,
2015,1,Why mess about with a site that excellent and easier to follow?,,,
2015,5,This is my favorite app seeking information for airlines.,,,
2015,1,Used to like it but update sucks got to find another app,,,
2015,1,"Old version was fantastic, new version is horrible.",,,
2015,1,Fan for previous version. Current version is not use friendly compare to previous version.,,,
2015,1,Cannot even find the departure airport.. KLIA......,,,
2015,5,Wow!! The new update is amazing and much intuitive!!,,,
2015,1,Im all for moving with the times and embracing change but there has got to be a benefit in it....I used to use this everyday to plan my trips...updated it and now I don't actually think I'll bother with it again... I like the option to search everywhere and anytime and pick up good flight prices and be able to check different prices for different days...bring back the old version,,,
2015,1,"The App was perfect as it was before. Now it has a million more add ons and steps to the process which really are rubbish. The flight price is now tiny, the text is tiny, it's no longer MOBILE friendly at all! Huge disappointment. I used to love the previous version.",,,
2015,4,"You can't select the flights after you search? Maybe a bug, but it was great and now it's not. Well done. Edit: disregard the above. Temporarily buggy. Probably my phone. It's fine now. UI changes always take a while to get used to.",,,
2015,1,I liked old version but current update has spoiled it. You can't select whole month. ...even if it is possible. . Still  not user friendly,,,
2015,1,The changes are terrible. I had been relying on this app to plan my travels and without the price chart it is useless. Please reintroduce this feature. Loved this app and now I can't even use it!,,,
2015,1,"HATE the new update. Older version was much much much simpler, user friendly and all out better. Do not upgrade if you haven't already.",,,
2015,5,"This app just went from minging to penging. I love the new features. It would help if we could save flights in folders you know, like they do in Airbnb. But this is still great",,,
2015,3,"It shows 2 icons which 1 of it is useless, but I've try uninstall the useless one, the other became useless. Reinstall it and both appears back. But using it is OK, no problem so far..",,,
2015,1,You ruined a perfectly good app! This upgrade is terrible! Layout is not as simple to use. I used to love this app now I'm looking for alternatives.,,,
2015,1,"What a horrible mess they have made of skyscanner. Overly complicated, I want to get flights...... That's it! You will learn. Uninstall",,,
2015,1,100% Loved It Before The  Update Now I 100% Hate it why did they have to get rid of suc h an easy to use helpful app to one that's just pure CR**,,,
2015,4,New layout is amazing..  Just don't understand why you don't offer multi destination,,,
2015,1,"I always thought updating an app meant it would be better,  but not with this app. It's confusing & hard to use now.",,,
2015,2,"Earlier version was much better n user friendly,how can I get the earlier version back",,,
2015,1,Before i can see all the flight I operated flights to my city and booking sites also after update nothing.pls pls do something likes before,,,
2015,2,I don't like this latest update it isn't as user friendly as the previous version,,,
2015,1,"You took a brilliant straight forward app, and killed it . was such a great app , I wish I could get back the previous version.",,,
2015,4,"There used to be a feature online that showed u prices over a few days as a graph, made it super easy to compare prices",,,
2015,2,Can't change the date of my flight search from Nov 5th which is a pain when I'm looking for a flight for today!,,,
2015,4,Although this version is more graphic. The previous version was better in searching and had more info.,,,
2015,1,Update is complex and bad. Earlier it was simple and quick.,,,
2015,1,Old version was better . If it's not broken don't fix it,,,
2015,1,"So good now uninstalling, was using regularly, no longer",,,
2015,4,I always use this to search flight whenever I plan traveling.,,,
2015,5,One of the best apps in market to book flights & compare prices all over the internet,,,
2015,5,This is the best app you can find to search cheap flights.,,,
2015,1,This was a great app but the new user interface is terrible.,,,
2015,5,Very good app with full of details of flights and joirney timing,,,
2015,1,New version  is very complicated to use and confusing,,,
2015,1,"Used to be my go-to app for flights, but latest update is awful. We just need 1 page with ADEP / ADES / Dates / no of travellers.. Not a whole load of pages and screens where info needs to be constantly updated. Please revert to old version or at least make latest update more user friendly. It's horrendously bad in its current format. Uninstalled.",,,
2015,1,"I used to use this with confidence now It can't be trusted. ...the prices are never accurate ..it's just untrustworthy. Also to all users beware your phone will be slower using this  latest update .myself and my coworkers 73 of us did an experiment pertaining to the speed of the phone once updated the phones became slow..  if anybody knows a different app let it be known, as we the consumers are the ones who keep these app developers in business.",,,
2016,2,"While choosing d flight always getting error ""Search requires an Internet connection. plz check ur settings"" though it has high bandwidth connection, this occurs in new and old versions, plz fix d bug. New  version user interface was not up to d mark, info was not clear, I revert back to older version of  v2.0.18 which had best user interface. Hope u fix it.",,,
2015,1,Oh dear. What have you done? Clumsy interface. No option for direct flights. You can't flip direction of departure/destination airports. Hate colour coded price bands - prefer to see actual cost. Reverted to old version of app.,,,
2017,1,"Basically rendered itself useless after the revamp.  I used to LOVE this app,  because I could quickly and easily search cheapest dates to fly to my destination on a calendar.  Now that doesn't exist and it's just trying to be another cheap travel site. Uninstalled.",,,
2016,2,"Edited for clarification:  Deselected airlines still show up in the results when another airline does the outbound or inbound flight, respectively. Even if you deselected BOTH the out- and inbound airline of a search result, it still shows up.  An NO, I don't want to deselect ""Multiple Airlines"". I have no problem with ""Multiple Airlines"" in my Roundtrip, I have a problem with specific airlines.",,,
2015,3,"It's quite good,  except that prices tend to go up when you look a longer time and then again when you finally book. Booking your flights directly with the carrier usually is cheaper. And why the heck does a flight search engine need access to my data/storage on the phone?",,,
2015,2,"I have just uninstalled as the new version wants too much access to my phone, you don't need it to look up flights, too invasive. Going elsewhere. 29/Nov/15 ...still asking for same permission on update, I thought this was being removed?",,,
2016,1,"You post flights and their prices,yet when you go to book your fare the app or god knows whoevers in control does the total opposite. For eg me and my family wanted a single flight from NZ to Australia we see air china at at a price of $1,200- $1,350 which is reasonable then you click to book it'll take you to jetstar or quantas at a ridiculous price it done this multiple times, In contrast would not recommend this app to any frequent flyer, found a better app which promises what they show...Horrible app",,,
2015,3,"I love Skyscanner, it provides up to date prices and it's easy to use. However, recently I've been encountering some problems - I can't do a new search. Every time I click the back button, I would expect to be on the search page but the app just closes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, help for a while but the same problem occured. I'm sure this is just a minor technical glitch. Overall, my experience with Skyscanner have been great and I've booked nearly all my tickets using this application!",,,
2016,1,"I dont know what your business policy is , but one thing i want to suggest you that any business doesnot last long when became fraud/ fake . fake avertisement and promises is your business's backfoot. So doesnot make forcefully to use your apps by advertising that you will get 10 rs for downloading and using ( via reward money apps ) it have a negative status towards your company. So going to uninstall.",,,
2015,1,I'm so excited about this app...but it doesn't work! !! Sad Face! It keeps telling me that my time zone is incorrect...my sister dl'd it too...its telling her the same thing. When i try to search for flights no matter what it tells me my time zone day and time are not correct. Is this a glitch in the update?,,,
2015,1,"Been trying to get used to but could not. New interface impossible to navigate through. Search, navigation, selections, just everything is bad. Cannot use this properly for flight search. Completely not fit for purpose anymore. Uninstalling.",,,
2016,5,I had a bit of a price discrepancy after I searched for a domestic flight. After sending a message to Skyscanner alerting them of the problem they assigned one of their technical representatives to reply to my complaint. Helped the best they could to my satisfaction and sent a follow up email. Best customer service thanks Skyscanner.,,,
2015,3,The price u end up paying isnt always whats dhown on skyscanner. The random array of travel agents all have their own quirky ways of adding to your ticket total. In the end ive found several times that booking through the airline would have been cheaper. Still its a good app that gives you a good overview of whats available at what times just be aware you wont always get the p4ice thats shown in the end,,,
2015,3,"I wondered why my scanned flight trip is not the same with my friend scanned flight trip. Both scanned the same day for the same destination flight. But mine is more expensive. I checked the ticket online, and some price were different than the result I got in the app. The function is good but Im not satisfied with the scanned result. Im using it on Android.",,,
2015,1,After new update it doesn't work. What is the point creat update when its not working. I had this app for 6 month and all was excellent. Just today it went from good to absolute crap. Fix it please and I will give you 5 stars. Now its for minus 5 stars.,,,
2016,2,"First opened app and game multi city choice. But when I came back later, only round trip. What good is that and why one moment it does and next time not? Checked every setting I could think of but nada",,,
2016,1,I used to be able to select where I was traveling from and the dates and I'd have options of available flights for multiple destinations. That was what made skyscanner better than all the other sites. Now it's no use for searching for random/spontaneous deals.,,,
2015,2,"Similar apps,  like KAYAK, apart form the flight number also show the aircraft type of the specific flight... Would be a great feature to have.  And the new UI is great,  it just needs improvement",,,
2016,3,It is neat and easy to use... when it works. Every couple of days it stops working and shows the message that the app needs to be updated BUT THERE IS NO UPDATE AVAILABLE,,,
2015,1,This company releases your credit card details to associated airlines and do not honour their quotes. Customer service is absolutely atrocious and disputes do not get resolved. 2 payments go out on separate dates with amounts that vary to what has been quoted. Skyscanner is terrible and should not be trusted with credit cards!!!!,,,
2015,1,"App needs new permissions identity (accounts on the device, profile data) but you do not explain why. Until explenation is added in readme 1 star remains. I do not sacrifice privacy unless you have a very good reason why I should",,,
2015,3,"A multi city option would be helpful. Also a more advanced search with flight times and airlines, etc could prove useful. Another problem i have had is that prices changed from the chart to the next screen sometimes.",,,
2016,3,Very easy to use ! Very nice apl. But it's not always accurate to find cheapest flights! Just booked a flight that skyscanner price was 760 euro at 220 euro!,,,
2015,5,"Love this feature. Rest of the app works fine. Every now brings up some promo prices that you can't actually get, seems more of a hoax from the ticket provider though so can't fault skyskanner for that.",,,
2016,3,Since couple of months the app doesn't match the best price it offers. Once you chose from chart the best price it increases when is updated. Moreover is not including the low cost airlines as vivacolombia or airpanama,,,
2015,4,Based on reviews of latest version...I'm not going to update for fear of it ruining what I'm using currently. Why change anything? It works so well already.,,,
2016,1,I can't view flight details as it prompts me to check my connection settings. It says this needs internet connection to work when in fact I have internet access. The similar app on my device doesn't have any issues like this and works perfectly fine.,,,
2015,1,Won't search for any flights?? Always used skyscanner before and found it was the only way to search for flights but with this app I haven't even been able to look at my options! Been trying for days.,,,
2016,4,Its great app and I am always using skyscanner to find great deals for my flight. Its just a shame that we cannot access the same features as the one available on the website with the app like multi city trip!,,,
2016,2,"The website does car hire and hotels as well. For some reason these have been broken out into different apps. Keep the app consistent with the website, please.",,,
2015,1,"Today's update means the app stops working telling me I have an outdated version. Only solution to delete and reinstall, so now lost all history",,,
2015,1,This app was good before but now it sucks. Before the ticket prices were accurate and the times were as well. Now the times arent always and the ticket prices never are. You see one price but when you go to buy it the actual price is much more. This app has become useless and unreliable.,,,
2015,5,"I've noticed a lot of people have complained about the new update but I've only just got the app, so for me this is all I know and it's been highly useful for finding the cheapest flights and cheapest surrounding dates to fly out and return on! I would recommend.",,,
2015,5,"Very good app but needs a custom search like this: ""everywhere to a country"". Already exist ""country to everywhere"" but not ""everywhere to a country"". For a lot of people would be nice and useful if it will be in the next update. Thanks :)",,,
2015,5,It shows cheaper  domestic flights in other countries which is really awesome and good to plan well in advance. Easy UI and much convenient than other apps to search domestic flights in other countries. 5* for sure. Hope this app stays the same.,,,
2016,4,Can we go back to the flight page directly? I know the company probably makes money with hotels but the reason we love the app is ONLY because the flight search feature.,,,
2015,1,finds 500 EUR flights that in reality end up costing over 1000 EUR. I reported this same problem month ago. Obviously they can't get their system fixed. Totally unreliable.,,,
2015,1,This is my prior comment - Maybe they could help Facebook with the correct way to design an app. Now no more.  It used to list the return prices. No longer. Why change it??,,,
2015,1,"Every time I search, this notice  pops up this app require internet connection check your setting. However my connection is working fine. I have used this app in two device same problem",,,
2015,1,It's not doing what it's supposed to do. Most of the days come out blank without any prices and you actually have to click on everyday to compare the days. Fix it!!,,,
2015,1,"I uninstalled this app because it requires access to your device's photos and videos (not sure why) and your identity information (also not sure why.) I understand why it needs Location access, but not these other things...",,,
2015,2,I did a search MSP to MIA and it came up with 2 airline choices and I had no filters. My husband found more on Google and a cheaper flight by $75. Fail.,,,
2015,2,"This is a good, but only weird thing is that you people don't add country taxes. The prices here are not the prices you get when you call to book. They will tell you the prices here don't include taxes. I think you should work on that so that someone finds out the exact prices here",,,
2015,5,Gets you the best and cheapest deals fast. Best choice of airlines and great layout of app. Easy to use and book. Really appreciate the bar graphs for comparisons.,,,
2015,5,This is the main app I use for finding flight deals. Way better than any other app/website.  Especially if you don't care when you travel.,,,
2016,5,Great app. I always check prices on this. I really like the feature that allows you to look for flights from a particular airport to anywhere in the world without having to specify the destination in advance.,,,
2016,3,"There's no multi-city button for this app. Update: Other than no multi-city, it is a great app. Thanks for the fast respond.",,,
2015,5,Keep in mind sometimes the prices are cheaper when you click the book by phone option. It said my round trip was $560 but it was actually only $400 taxes in :),,,
2015,1,I was trying to baying a Ticket but its gave  there is something wrong and notify me to check my email address! !! even i don't  know  if it took something from my account? ?! its was strange,,,
2015,3,"Love the thoroughness of the search. Needs the ability to continue to view your search offline. When offline it forces you to refresh your search losing the info until online again.  Also, needs the ability to search using multiple destination or arrival airports.",,,
2015,4,Overall the application works fine for searching the cheap flights. I think it can be improve further if it has new features like - break journey.,,,
2015,4,Use this app every yr when i book my holidays. Pretty annoyed after updating it its not working at all. Would love to see it fixed,,,
2015,5,"Skyscanner is how I've booked my past 5 years worth of travel, I wouldn't bother with anything else now because I know I'll always get the cheapest airfare this way. Love the way you can scan through the dates to see if you left the next day your flight might be half the price. Love love love it!",,,
2015,2,Much preferred the old way of searching for flights where you could select the time of the outgoing and incoming separately. this way you have to trawl through loads of flights flights to find the ones suited  to you. now I just search direct with the airline,,,
2015,2,I used this app constantly in the past but more recently its advertised pricing is just to far out. Today i looked at a BA flight advertised on sky scanner at ¬£115 when I went to purchace it rocketed to  ¬£284 sky scanner need to be more up to date!,,,
2016,5,I'm able to see all the flights in one place with lots of filters. It even includes Southwest airline. The prices are so helpful.,,,
2016,5,It's simple accurate and user friendly. Since I have installed this app I'am using it to check the best offred price and also book my flight tickets.,,,
2016,5,Best way to search all flight operators. Just some times price is higher when go to the site. Not often enough to concern me though.,,,
2016,3,The previous version was simple and more user friendly...in this version I face lot of  bugs and some confusion on flight booking and also stop showing Ryanair flights,,,
2015,5,I had been using it since year 2012. I even use it as the search engine for all tickets comparison for my thesis. It never let me down. It is highly recomended to use. I recommended to all my frens n family. Thz skyscanner.,,,
2015,5,"Love this app, allows searches for flights with all available airlines through lots of different agents to find best possible flights to suit time, budget and preferred route, direct or with stop-offs.   Love the facility to seach whole month, to view best prices over a range of dates.  Have recommended to many colleagues and friends.",,,
2015,5,"One of the best travel app, deals with my airlines in order to provide you with the cheapest price. It's only missing the loyalty program with its users",,,
2015,1,"This version is more difficult to use and not as convenience as the previous version, when u do upgrade version, u choose keep the good and improve the bad, this is quite disappointed! Bring back the old version ...please.",,,
2016,5,Always gets me the cheapest flight at the times I want. Or I can view the cheapest flights in a month. This is awesome. Better than booking directly.,,,
2015,5,"The smartest tool to search flights EVER!! The only thing that can be updated is the option to include ""everywhere"" in the ""from"" option, to for instance, search from where is the best place to flight to London",,,
2015,4,"Always gets me the best fare in one place, without need to search in multiple sites. Would love to have multicity option.",,,
2016,1,"This app doesn't work.  I receive an error message saying I'm not connected to the net, whilst everything else works.",,,
2015,5,Thats how a phone application should look like. Gr8 job. But why no Israel's currency? (ILS),,,
2015,5,This has become my go to app for flight bookings. A great UI & best pricing & timing options. Love it.,,,
2015,4,Very easy to use. I think they should come up with a better way to compare different flights where you don't have to open and switch between new windows all the time,,,
2015,5,"Love this app.  The only one that allows you to search without putting in arrival and departure dates, so flexible and helpful! Found flights from Texas to Colorado for $78!  Score!",,,
2015,5,Love this app is pretty accurate.  What I  recommend for those who do round trip is to check round trip prices and one way prices for each way and compare the best. It helps a lot! :-D,,,
2015,5,..especially if you are flexible with travel options... just searching places to everywhere and plan a trip around the cheapest deals!,,,
2015,5,"This is the only app that I've found that treats its users with respect, and tries to provide data- not find ""deals"".",,,
2015,3,"Nice, but I wish it would be the same good as one for ios. E.g. maps view is super feature to have.",,,
2015,1,"There is no reason for this app to require Identity permission. I have contacted their support, they claim it is needed for Google sign-in, which is incorrect.",,,
2015,1,last version is very student-made. i will not update until you bring back old ui.,,,
2016,4,Only improvement I can think of is price drop notifications for saved flight searches - but I use this app regularly!,,,
2015,3,Great for finding flights. Just don't book through the app. You don't get a confirmation and by the time you get through to find out the flight will be full.,,,
2016,1,Now ruined by annoying promotion texts to your phone. Bad enough that they made the flight search function so convoluted.,,,
2015,4,Perfect app to use when looking to just get out of town.  Wish name of destination would appear next to airport code at top of flight selection page.,,,
2015,1,"Why exactly and how do we prevent these intrusions? Brilliant functionality, simple to use. What more could anyone want?",,,
2016,5,"I just booked a mega cheap flight and i'm very glad that this app exist.great job guys,thank you",,,
2015,5,They finally fixed the issue where we cant see flights ahead of time. Thanks for the quick response and fix.,,,
2016,5,"Love this app, it finds what dates I need at low rates every time. My favorite is the chart showing pricing for dates around your selected dates, it's so helpful when you have flexibly to get the lowest rate",,,
2016,5,"Flexible, easy to navigate, able to change payment country and payment currency. I found my last plane tickets using this app and it beat everything I found using other Internet-based services.",,,
2015,5,Very impressed with how this app works. When trying to get to a funeral it was invaluable to quickly find the best flight to and from the location.,,,
2016,2,The app is stuck on the one flight and I can't search for anything else. Even if I reset the app.,,,
2016,1,Cannot register or log into any account using my email or Facebook it keeps trying to reset my password then telling me I'm using an invalid link what a joke and total waste of time,,,
2015,4,Use this app for few years and each time found good deal. Thanks!,,,
2016,2,Why don't have multiple route option? Only round trip and one way.,,,
2015,2,Can't get the explore option like the one available on iPhone. Disappointing really.,,,
2015,5,Great app. Easy to use and to help visualize results quickly with lots of options!,,,
2015,5,Up to date info all the time and gives me so much inspiration! Select to go anywhere and it comes up with a list of crazy places to fly to in price order!!,,,
2016,5,"I simply love ""watched"". It helps me a lot to find the best and cheapest flights",,,
2015,5,Have been using it since 2012 and Works excellent! Gives me the best offers!,,,
2015,1,Why this new update needs access to my media files?!! No way that I am alowing this....,,,
2015,2,"When I select my departure airport, the return flights emediatly go up. Can you say ""Bait and Switch.",,,
2015,5,Love this app It's Very ease to use and have great deals.. Thank you,,,
2015,3,This app needs to have multiple destinations option so I don't have waste time going on a PC to book a multi city flight.,,,
2015,5,Cuando se trata de vuelos siempre comparo. Esta aplicacion de verdad compara bastantes aerolineas. Resulto que habia vuelos mas baratos y con aerolineas diferentes a las que encontraba en expedia o despegar. Totalmente feliz,,,
2015,4,easy to use. not complicated. a must-have for any traveler.,,,
2015,2,"I have no idea what is going wrong, but it is showing completely out of the world prices... compared to google flights :-/",,,
2016,5,"So far I haven't found anything that can beat Skyscanner, and having it in such a well crafted app is just super!  :)",,,
2015,5,This is a great travel companion app. Overall view plus customisable alerts. Keep up the great work Dev Team,,,
2015,5,I had a family emergency I needed to travel across from the east to the north and it located all the connecting flights that I needed it set up my itinerary and I pay I paid the low the average of what the flights were going for...,,,
2015,5,Older version were much better..i can't even get notifications for prices,,,
2016,5,Results are not so accurate when one chooses all dates or all possible destinations. That is also understandable. The rest is great!,,,
2015,5,"Perfect in so many ways. Fast, light weight, and entertaining",,,
2015,5,The update is very good but their is no option of direct flights individually without flights with stops.,,,
2015,4,Very happy with app. Does as its website. Cheap tickets,,,

2015,5,This app is good for the traveller. But sometimes lost connection in phone and pc.,,,
2015,1,I don't like new version. Old one was more understendible,,,
2015,5,It's my first place to search and the best. Better than expedia. Love it.,,,
2015,5,"Perfect for scanning prices but always prefer to book directly with airline company rather than ""e-travell agencies"" that will always add hidden costs and sometimes down right rip you off.",,,
2015,5,"Made reservations. Worked well, saved dollars.  If flight goes well will continue  to use a lot.",,,
2015,5,App works great.  Will get the lowest prices available.,,,
2015,5,Amazing prices. Hassle free app!! No complaints here :-),,,
2015,5,Awesome app.  Compares most sites and gives best deal.,,,
2015,5,uninstalled and reinstalled fixed it. many thanks. :-),,,
2015,2,"Not reliable at all. The date shows cheap price, when u click in the detail shows doubled price!",,,
2016,1,Please revert to original user interface. New design is ugly and confusing.,,,
2015,4,Can you add multi flights. The best app but just to make it more convenient and practical multi tab be so.much easier,,,
2015,5,"Fluid, reliable and very good at finding flight times and cheap flights! Could do with improving how you change between tabs",,,
2015,5,Making it easy to have your travel agent honest. 1/2 by app. 1/2 agent...,,,
2015,2,Why does skyscanner all of a sudden require my identity? Why can't changelogs be clear on not only the what but also the why?,,,
2015,5,Please include a multi city travel option . It would be a great update,,,
2016,1,Installed it because of a fake advertisement. I usually don't use such a crab.,,,
2015,2,This app is great but I am disappointed cause the tunisian dinar is missing in the currency list. Plz add it.,,,
2015,4,"Hoteles, vuelos, carros de todo solo have falta que te toquen el timbre y te lleven al avi√≥n :)",,,
2016,3,Pretty good except that I can't work out how to see multi city /open jaw itineraries,,,
2015,5,I love it and prefer to my friends. Thank you developers.,,,
2015,4,"I'd love it if it had an option to search for multi-city flights, not just one-way and roundtrip.",,,
2015,1,Got no passport al give more stars if they can help me book flight whitout passport,,,
2015,4,It works just fine some prices are not accurate but it's okay I already got the hang of it,,,
2015,3,"Asking for too many permissions,  plenty of other apps do the job,  so delete.",,,
2016,4,Nice and excellent work but air lines offer not display please improved this  problem,,,
2015,3,I guess I'll just stick with the previous app while the new one gets wrecked.,,,
2015,1,when i searched for flights to nyc and chicago it kept turnjng up blank though flights showed up on websites. what is wrong with this app?????,,,

2015,1,Only for large international airports to large international airports,,,
2016,5,..................P E R F E C T.....................,,,
2015,5,I've been using this app for a while and it's perfect! A lot of airlines and flights lot of prices! Love it!,,,
2015,2,"This is usually my go-to app for finding flights. However, the last couple of days I have been trying to search it tells me that I have an older version and need to update the app. I go into the play store and it says the app is up to date. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it didn't fix issue.",,,
2016,1,The old app allows you to see the pricing for an entire calendar month all at once rather than putting in specific dates. With this new revised version you have to search specific dates it's kind of a hit-or-miss trying to find the cheapest prices now. I deleted the app,,,
2015,2,"I have to jump thru hoops to search for a flight. Hitting the search button takes me to the watched list.  -since the last update, I am able to search but now the app will show ""No Results"" for a particular flight on a given day. When I go to the full website, there are indeed flights for that day. For example, I was looking for a one way flight from DCA to CUN on 26 Sep and the app showed no results.",,,
2015,4,I would give 5* if it's simiar as the website to enable search of multi-cities. Eg I want to go from Kuala Lumpur to Dublin and return from England to Singapore. If I have to book 2 segments it's rather cumbersome and one way is crazily expensive.,,,
2015,4,Sometimes fails to give you the cheapest options so check every airport individually. 95% of the time it is not wrong. App is a great starting point,,,
2015,5,"Cheapest way to find a flight and if you use hotel scanner aswell you can save more, you can see a graph and see what days are cheaper to fly, you would be surprise how much u can save, I've even checked other apps and sites to see if they was cheaper searches and I found this app is all you need! Thanks guys",,,
2016,1,Now is a crap. Used to be easy and SIMPLE to find flights. Now the app is overcomplicated not user friendly any more. Uninstalled and found some other alternative.,,,
2015,5,"Works properly and give you almost the same versatility from the website.  I'm not sure if we have the option to do multiple flights on the app, but would be nice.",,,
2015,5,Works great on my Galaxy Note 8 and my Note 3 phone. Never have an issue with the app. Process always match TripAdvisor. Live in Asia so valuable asset.,,,
2015,3,"Hi skyscanner, when i make a search and then get the results, i try to filter the results with my prefered companies and or prefered hours. But the results don t update when i select ""save"", nothing happens.   What am I doing wrong....????",,,
2015,3,I found lots of better options in other Web pages and apps  like momondo. It was far from my expectation. It was difficult to find the option of  changing currency.,,,
2015,4,Did helped me to save $$$. Please allow for updates to be sent as soon as the price is changed so we dont miss out on deals instead of sending alerts once a day.,,,
2015,1,This app will cost you money. My Daughter's return flight from Sydney to Adelaide is $152 cheaper yes... $152 cheaper through the Skyscanner app.,,,
2015,5,This app provides quick and accurate information on the cheapest airline. It works fast even on a slow Internet connection. Great job,,,
2015,4,"Consistently getting the lowest prices compared to other flight apps, trends table is very useful, love the widget too. Only problem I have found is you cannot use the widget if you move the app to your SD card.",,,
2015,5,"Easy to nav. Have always used web version and it's as good as, no option limits as u get with most apps.",,,
2015,4,Simple and easy to use. It just works! Great for holding 'price matching' travel agents to accountability!,,,
2015,1,Always told flights were sold out. Tonight they still say they have those deals. I call bs,,,
2015,3,Decent app but its not showing up any prices for the flight im trying to select for next year its just showing up various british airports with no prices. What am i doing wrong?,,,
2015,5,My boyfriend lives in North Carolina and I live in Minnesota. Getting to see each other is expensive and rare with the app found plane tickets for less than 200 roundtrip. Needless to say i see him more nowüòÅ,,,
2015,5,This app has been by far the most inexpensive for airfares. Not only do they post updated prices. They also work with a bundle of vendors to accomodate any Nomad.,,,
2015,2,"I booked 2 flights through one of the web sites the redirected me and they canceled my flight 2 times hours before the flight, I had to use kayak instead and I didn't have any problem, more expensive tho....good app but bad experience for me",,,
2015,5,Great app. Definitely my favorite for booking and looking for flights. Easy and user friendly.,,,
2015,1,This app completely fails. Every low price flight it shows is totally unavailable. I should have known better..!!,,,
2015,5,The greatest thing to come along in a very long time. It doesn't get any better than this. I hope they will add the type of aircraft for each flight.,,,
2015,4,Any chance for push notifications for price changes? Maybe notification when it hits a certain price? Widget is nice too,,,
2015,3,"La aplicaci√≥n esta genial, pero hecho de menos una opci√≥n de e indicar un n√∫mero de d√≠as y una peque√±a flexibilidad +-2 d√≠as",,,
2015,4,"One thing that would very help is an option for a flexible flights in a given dates range, for example between 20.8 to 15.9 (like the 'whole month' but more flexible).",,,
2015,5,"It provides all available airlines and dates when your schedule is flexible. I still haven't bought a ticket yet, but I've compared it to the airlines website and this app shows the cheapest flight",,,
2015,5,I have been looking everywhere for an app like this! It is extremely easy to use and very accurate. I will never use anything else to find cheap flights!,,,
2015,5,I have purchased several flight and am very happy with the deals I get. I have purchased flights in and out of the US and the app is super easy to use,,,
2015,3,please add skywise and safair airlines to your search engines algorithm to get the most cost effective prices for the South African user / consumer using your application,,,
2015,5,Great prices. I gave been using it to plan a vacation for next year I hope and you can't find round trip flights for under $300 almost anywhere,,,
2015,4,Used this app to book many flights. Works good and seams to find fairly reasnable prices.,,,
2015,4,Very good app. Easy to use. But u need to add the multi destination as well to it.,,,
2015,1,The app is now useless and no longer works properly. Use the website or don't bother,,,
2015,2,It won't go back to home search page. I stopped this app forced but it comes same again..,,,
2015,4,I've found great deals using Skyscanner. Happy returning customer.,,,
2015,5,"Need to improve more in every area of flights, low cost information also payment have to be done here not to redirect to Google Chrome.",,,
2015,2,Once skyscanner used to be the one to find the cheapest but nowadays they are at least 10 to 20 % costlier than the other Apps available.,,,
2015,5,Very good app. I always find the best combination with the best price. I recommend it 100%,,,
2015,5,I've booked my airline tickets for a multi city journey for around 11 destinations and this app showed me 25-30% less fares than many more.Trust me this best,,,
2016,1,So bad application why they need my information for use the application!!! I uninstalled the application üòÉ,,,
2018,5,Very helpful indeed. Makes it easy to plan trips in advance,,,
2015,4,Thanks for the use... Pls can r respond to email forwarded on 02Sep...,,,
2015,4,"So far so good with this app, i love how it track if prices have gone up or down since your last visit.",,,
2015,5,Very easy to use. Never had a problem. Use it for all of my trips.,,,
2015,5,My wife says that if I can use this app then it must be very good and so easy to use because I am more simple than a simple thing doing nothing!,,,
2015,5,I've saved thousands in fares thanks to this app.  I recommend to all my friends,,,
2015,1,I'm very upset with myself for using this app it wasn't the cheapest price and it had a lot of hidden charges...I will not be using it again.,,,
2015,4,"I love this app, seems like it does help finding best prices but when you go to check out the price raises",,,
2015,2,I can't see just one airline and it seems like there should be more flights available then viewable...,,,
2015,5,It is simple to use and it searches the best deals. No more to say.,,,
2015,4,Great app but it would be good if you added multiple destination option (more than 2),,,
2015,5,"I would recommend using an internet flight agent after selecting your price rather than phone, Ive only ever had problems with the latter",,,
2015,3,Could you please tell us why others Airlines doesn't show it or you don't have the flight information?,,,
2015,3,"Good, could be better... Please add multi destination like on website.",,,
2015,3,"It's a very nice app, just need to add more low cost companies",,,
2015,1,I can not get it to find any flights for any days or places. What am I doing wrong?,,,
2015,4,Easy to filter your desired flight and time as well. I will surely recommend this to others,,,
2015,2,Some airline names the print is so tiny you cant work it out seems someone has messed up the settings on sizing the print,,,
2015,4,"Still one of the best app, however skyscanner used to be much better, especially offered more possibilities of airlines",,,
2015,4,Would be nice to not trigger price alerts only because currency exchange rate has changed,,,
2015,1,Not really a good app when you don't have a comparison of ALL the airlines from Atlanta.,,,
2015,5,"Encontre el vuelo mas barato y solo en segundos, la mejor aplicacion se vuelos en el Mercado..  Bravo",,,
2015,5,Nice apps.. The travellers must get it to get a flight ticket and to grab for the best price....,,,
2015,4,Searching for flights becomes easier but sometimes the price should be updated,,,
2015,4,Better than the mobile website but still lacking some options.,,,
2015,3,Need more extensive search as I do not see all airlines fares.,,,
2015,4,"Starts searching for flights, you see a few come up and then an error message pops up and all the flights disappear.",,,
2015,4,"I can't find arabic in this application. Why? Please, add it to the app.",,,
2015,5,Low price you can get in this app.. Up date tiket love it,,,
2015,5,Used a lot over the years. Only wish list is that you could add nearby airports make getting prices easier,,,
2015,4,I really like the app and look forward ti booking some flights!,,,
2015,2,The fly price on chart window grow twice when go to order window.,,,
2015,5,Better than websites and it includes all the airline I know of. Very good indeed,,,
2015,5,"Especially useful for searches such as ""fly me FROM (a specific airport) TO "" anywhere"". No other app can do this.",,,
2015,4,I would give five stars if it was a multi flights button,,,
2015,5,This is the best app to easily find and book the cheapest flights. $300 New York to India!,,,
2015,4,Super useful app.Would be better if it covers even the local airlines.,,,
2017,5,You can save a lot of time with this app. A must for travellers!,,,
2015,1,It's giving many wrong information. Please correct it,,,
2015,5,I have a good review about this app but i want to know why its not showing erbil flights to other countries....,,,
2015,5,Great app for checking flights and what not. The chart view is a personal fav.,,,
2015,5,"It's great for finding cheap flight fares, dates and plenty of airlines to choose from!",,,
2015,1,Riddled with bugs and presents completely different results to the web site,,,
2015,5,This app helpful for me and also my friends. .Thanks üíìüíìüíìüíìüíìüíìüíìüíìüíì,,,
2015,3,Like it. It's necessary more options for clearances.,,,
2015,5,I use all time..perfect simple tool for people who flight around :),,,
2015,5,"Very productive app, must have if you travel a lot.",,,
2015,5,Saved me ¬£s and was able to Taylor my trip to suit my budget *****,,,
2015,5,I've used successfully and without any problems for over a year.,,,
2015,4,I especially like the flexibility on searching dates and destinations.,,,
2015,5,"The app seems good itself, but think some of the travel agents using it can be a bit dodgy",,,
2015,4,I really love skyscanner because of all the prices it shows.,,,
2015,5,I was able to find a flight from Miami Florida to London for $800!,,,
2015,5,Really helpful to gage flight prices ahead of time and plan a trip accordingly.,,,
2015,4,"Everything I click on an advertised price it  goes up after it ""searchers availability""",,,
2015,5,"The app works so good,  and always shows best values for money.",,,
2015,5,I've book several flights from Saigon to LAX and always had the best prices from SC.,,,
2015,5,This apps is not bad at all...it checks and update flight price daily,,,
2015,5,"This is a very helpful app, gives you lots of options at a range of prices.",,,
2015,5,Its great and it helps u a lot for finding the best flight!,,,
2015,5,Nice and amazing program..very fast.thanks for all developer,,,
2015,5,"No issues with crashing, does a good initial flight pull.",,,
2015,5,Used it several times and always comes up with a great deal.,,,
2015,5,"Very smart app, it save time comparing to other search engines",,,
2015,5,MANAGING DIRECTOR                            FRIENDLY TRADING & CONTG W.L.L.   QATAR.,,,
2015,5,Love how you can view process on surrounding days that you search for.,,,
2015,5,I like this app because it shows me the cheapest price. ..,,,
2015,5,Enables me to set reminders and to play with the app..,,,
2015,5,A great tool for researching and booking flights around the globe.,,,
2015,5,"Excellent application, still need multi destination option",,,
2015,3,Says low prices then click on price and no seats available,,,
2015,5,My first point of call when I want to plan a trip. Has everything I need and expect to find.,,,
2015,5,This app is straight to the point and simple to use.,,,
2015,5,I used this to plan a 2 month trip in Europe.   It's a great tool.,,,
2015,5,Excelente aplicaci√≥n a la hora de buscar pasajes aereos!! Me encanta :),,,
2016,1,This was by far my favorite app for searching for flights due to its flexibility. Being able to leave the destination and travel dates open to quickly find low prices was great. The bar graph showing prices on several dates for each way made it easy to find the lowest price simply by selecting the travel date with the shortest bar. This new version took that take away. PLEASE REVERSE THIS UPDATE!,,,
2016,1,"New interface makes it very unclear. They tried to clone Google flights. Uninstalling.            In reply to Skyscanner, I won't go through an entire procedure on your website to send a simple email. So I'll do it here. The interface is terrible and I refuse to use your app with it. I've used it for years until now. It's fubar.",,,
2015,4,A great ap that does we hat it says. Its especially useful when you want to know prices to a place but don't even know which airlines fly there. The pricing system is a bit flaky but it is a good indication of the deals available.  I'd always go to the airline directly once I can see who looks cheapest.,,,
2015,4,"I like the feature that it allows me to search without specifying dates so that i can fly on the day that is least costly.  However, I wish it will let me exclude airline/ airlines that I won't fly. For instance, when I search for flights from NY to Miami, frontier airlines persistently comes up as the least expensive.  However,  I don't fly that airline. So, it's sort of a waste of time to search for results that I will never use.",,,
2015,4,I really like this app. It has helped save me a lot of money. What I don't like is when it shows me a low price and when I click on it a new browser comes up and the price is not even close to the price it showed me. That has mostly happened with Bravofly. When that happens it wastes me a lot of time plus I got excited for no reason.  I have changed travel plans because I end up losing out on a low fare. Otherwise the app can be very useful.,,,
2015,3,"After reporting that it is really really slow, developer did something server side and asked me to try again. It is faster now.  New comments/requests:  display or link to fare classes and restrictions, airline filter option active before search (would speed up search).",,,
2015,3,Oh no! I loved the graph that made it really easy to see what days to travel and get the best deals. Now you can only search for particular dates just like every other search engine. Really disappointed as I loved that feature and was why I recommended it to everyone.,,,
2015,4,"I like this app. Since I fly a lot, I think it will be very useful. I would like the ""watch"" feature to work a little better though. I filtered to see direct flights only, but when I add it to the watch list, it takes the lowest price flight which is a connection. I would like to be able to watch the applied filters.",,,
2015,1,"The app is great for searching for flights. However, today when I really wanted to use it to book a flight, it directed me to the website where the flights were no longer available, TWICE!! It's obviously not in sync with the websites...I ended up using a search website on the PC and paying more than what Skyscanner had made me think I was going to pay. 1‚òÜ rating this time..",,,
2015,1,"Was in desperate need of a flight back home from another continent,  and every time I tried to pick a flight it would either drastically change in price, (up to 800%) or would then just say something went wrong and send me back to the main page.  This is not what I needed at that time.. these apps are supposed to make things easier and less stressful, not more.",,,
2015,4,"Good app, but i am somewhat confused by some of the prices. On a return flight search you select your outbound and your return flights to give an overall total, all prices are displayed so you can choose the cheapest, however upon selecting your outbound flight all the return flights increase considerably. You are probably better off booking 2 seperate single flights. That aside its a useful app and saves do much time shopping around.",,,
2015,4,"For a flexible traveller, you get to see the prices for other days close to your travel date, which is good. But many times these prices are not accurate, once you clicked on it and it takes you to the site for you to make the purchase, the prices suddenly went higher. I fly long distance every couple of months, and have seen this happen many times. This app is good to get the estimate price for the flights, but be aware that it might not be the price charged to you in the end.",,,
2015,4,Great app but needs multi search functionality to get 5 stars. Also can not search anytime in a month like online. When you select anytime it searches a whole year. Frustrating as you need to search daily. Also no option to eliminate airlines like Malaysia Airlines.,,,
2015,1,"Skyscanner redirected me to Bravofly to pay for my ticket, but upon paying for my ticket, I received an error from my bank's website, and I have no way of knowing whether it went through or not.  I didn't get any confirmation e-mail, so now I worry I will get charged for no ticket! :(",,,
2015,4,"Everysince i got the app it feels like a game, and the objective is to find how many places i can go with spending an arm and a leg. Thank you Skyscanner! Now lets get better about those hotel and flight deals.",,,
2015,4,Does what it claims. Consistently finds the best prices. Two issues though. 1. I'd like to be able to exclude given airlines before searching. and 2) I'd like to be able to set up alerts for a period of time (e.g. 5 days either way on departure and return dates) not just a single pair of days. Then it would be 5* :),,,
2015,5,"Great application, user friendly and helpful when trying to make a fast choice on where to go.   Although I do give positive feedback on the app I can see one implement or one idea that maybe be beneficial! Sometimes people just want a spontaneous holiday or getaway for a weekend or a week , so maybe another section for last minute bargains that could be gotten.",,,
2015,1,"I have been using this app for some time now and recently it just stopped showing most of the airlines. It only shows me US Airways, American Airline, and multiple airlines. Went through all settings and even tried uninstalling/reinstall and still the same. I travel 2 - 3 times a week and this was a reliable app for a short time and now went down the tubes.",,,
2015,1,I'll just say this......as soon as I booked a flight my credit card company called me to a fraud alert!  They couldn't give me a confirmation number 48 hours later and I was flying in 12 hours.after 3 calls and hours on hold I decided to call credit card company to dispute the changes. ...,,,
2015,1,"I had to buy two tickets, first one never went through, the second one after a comfirmation and calling the airline I could not get through to anyone that spoke English. Prices are good if you are willing to sit on hold for almost a week to get through to someone on the phone to speak with.",,,
2015,2,I dont know why i can't search after pick place n date. Keep saying no data while it works fine on website. Re install for second time and still the same.,,,
2015,4,"This app finds and prices a wide variety of flight options. It is easy to use. It would be good to add a flexible date option (if is there, it is not obvious) and an open jaw option.",,,
2015,2,"I have booked a lot of flights through this app and have had very good service. But one provider of flights (edreams) was the absolute worst choice I could have ever made. They didn't give me my flight that I had paid for so I had to book through somebody else, and now they won't even give me a refund for the flight that I didn't even have a seat on.",,,
2015,2,"Your application runs very slow on my LG G3. It used to search very quickly,but in the past 2 weeks,it runs very slowly. My internet speed is normal,my phone still has a lot of memories. Please help. Thanks",,,
2015,2,"Why is it that when I select an outward date from the monthly chart, most of the return dates become either unavailable or more expensive, and when I select a return date first, most of the outward dates become either unavailable or more expensive? This makes finding the best deal much more frustrating and difficult than the at-a-glance layout would suggest.",,,
2015,1,"Found too good to be true pricing in the date picker, and then the prices doubled by the time I got to checkout.  Google's web tool for flight searches is much better.",,,
2015,5,I have brain cancer and am planning on flying to missouri next month to see an old friend. I have been checking daily and I am hoping the prices are still good once I have the money to fly. But I like this concept so far so good. :-),,,
2015,2,Loved it at first especially the floght tracker widget. When i tried to book i found out that prices do not match search results and links to agencies/airlines don't always work which makes it a meaningless scanner.,,,
2015,4,"Hi Skyscanner folk, I reinstalled app as suggested and it works perfectly now.   Thanks for the tip,  Derek  _________________________________________________ """"When I tap the departure field, the screen changes for me to type, but nothing comes up as I type and search, rendering the app useless, completely.""""",,,
2015,5,"This app is phenomenal! Why, because the any day, any where search is simply the best.  Have a dozen booked flights because of it and it's very addicting. But hey deals are here and the search is very user friendly.  Love it!!",,,
2015,5,"Love that it includes Southwest.  Also, the bar graph option is great to check the best days to fly to/from specific destinations. Just wish you could search nearby airports using this feature.",,,
2015,1,"Just installed this app... no good.  The lowest flight it shows for 12/31/14 - 01/04/2016 from CMH to SAN is $532. Numerous other sites online show a $417 ticket.  When I looked at the airlines to see why it wasn't offering this ticket, it was no wonder... it's only searching four airlines!  AA, SW, United, and ""Multiple.""  Obviously it isn't searching Delta.",,,
2015,4,"Good app, only issue I have with it is that the shortcut no longer exists on my home screens...you have to go in through the app store. Rather strange. Never seen this before, was never an issue in the past.",,,
2015,3,"I use to use this app a lot but I've noticed it no longer shows Delta flights...... I just uninstalled the app and reinstalled it.  Delta shows up now, but the prices are inaccurate prices are usually no less than $1,200",,,
2015,2,"When I first installed this a few months ago it worked great! I've booked a couple flights with this app. Now, all it does is tell me no results for flights no matter where I search flights for.",,,
2015,4,The app works fine and I think it is a great app. I think the problem you are having is that we don't trust anymore the prices shown after a few searches as it is known that prices tend to increase when you repeatedly search for a flight.,,,
2015,1,"Ok to find prices, but don't plan on getting a reservation confirmation for 24 hrs (if at all).. then don't call them as they are no help and direct you to the airline and you can find yourself in the middle and it's ridiculous trying to get your money refunded.",,,
2015,4,Was highly recommended by a few friends whom tried & tested this app.It was able to check & compared to other flights/hotel availability. Was very happy & useful for an very impromptu trip I used recently.. thumb upüòâ,,,
2015,5,2 suggestions: The list of destinations or cities should be smarter. Especially the last viewed destination and destination city. A map would be also helpful to plan an trip with many legs to cover a region.,,,
2015,3,Tjereis an issue after the new update.  It is almost impossible to get the main screen.  It keeps in memory the last search and denies to go back to the home screen,,,
2015,3,love the app. simple and easy to use... however sometimes  the price listed in the search is different to when the airlines are loaded. ive tried refreshing it a few times and still get the same issue,,,
2015,1,"Even though I find terrific deals, it won't let me book the flights. What a scam!!!  I may as well book straight through the airlines themselves.",,,
2015,1,As others said before pricing is very incorrect $100 minimum more than it shows that also local flights! And you get standard reply from the team to check their website! I checked ADL to Hobart flights,,,
2015,4,"Would give five stars if i could exclude an airline from the results.  Poor service low cost airlines are included in the results, and it takes time to ignore these in the results.  There are airlines I will never use again!",,,
2015,4,Wonderful just it has more options.  Like flexible days for price comparison like other sites and also multiple countries.  It only has one way and return,,,
2015,1,Not having the ability to search multi-city flights makes the app worthless for me. Don't know why this feature wouldn't be available for the US market.,,,
2015,2,Had this app for years n loved it was very useful. This time looking for flights the prices are totally inaccurate. Eg skyscanner says the price for 3 people is 294each then when you click it it shoots up to ¬£1068 total ???? Frustrating !!!,,,
2015,5,"Great flight booking app. Shows you flights and prices for more than three months, unlike other web apps that only shows you a week's range. Area of opportunity: Hope you can include more (local) flights. Some promo flights are not listed there.",,,
2015,1,I searched same date flights using phone app and through desktop. Prices appeared on the phone app were different from what I got using my desktop. Huge price discrepancy.,,,
2015,5,Amazing for finding cheap flights for travelling. Better than most travel agents for getting what you want struggles at multiple connecting flights some times but you just need to search the flights individually and sometimes you get a better deal that way.,,,
2015,4,"I really like this app. Used it 2 years ago to find my flight to ireland, and using it now for a flight in the US. Prices aren't concrete because airlines are always changing their prices, but this gives you a good estimate on how much a flight could cost.",,,
2015,1,"Wherever I am looking for tickets in the any day mode, I see really good prices. If I click them, the real price is 4 times more expensive!",,,
2015,5,Booked my holiday through this app and saved myself about ¬£300 only issue is that my flight is with air france and had to pay extra to take a case but and extra ¬£28 for a case is nothing compared to what I saved! I will happily use this app for future trips and would recommend this to anyone! 5‚òÜ,,,
2015,4,"I should have give 5 but it is not perfect. So consider my 4 as a 4.8 Great app, I use it all the time, it even replaced the other I used, although sometimes the prices shown as nothing to do with the price once on the airline website (main problem)",,,
2015,5,Great way of tracking flights for a planned trip.  Regular messages alert you to price changes whether they go up or down. Ability to track multiple airports for the same destination is a real plus if you live in a major metropolitan area like NYC,,,
2015,3,Would be brilliant if there's an alert option for a period of time not just for the specified departure and arrival. Would need an alert for price changes in 2016.,,,
2015,5,I like this app. Bcoz there is a option to search flight without a fixed date. That is really helpful to find a date to travel @ cheap.,,,
2015,4,"When I've looked up flight costs on here, like the website, it's not always 100% up to speed with price changes but will pick up the latest info when you select a flight & go to the seller sites. Also, it used to show cheaper alternatives if you were to fly a day either side of your selected date or from nearby alternate airports-that seems to have gone :-( a useful part of a search I found.",,,
2015,4,The user interface is very easy to navigate and I love that there is a recent searches feature. Also has cheaper flights than the websites I used to use.,,,
2015,4,"First of all, love the app, great job. One little question, whenever I search for 'any day', some days get an arrow instead of prices. What do these mean? Thanks in advance.",,,
2015,5,Sometimes i dream of traveling place  to place by always picking the next destination from the everywhere results. When i really am traveling this is my go to. Thank you sky scanner!,,,
2015,5,"If there's one essential travel app its this. I travel around 5-10 times a year, every year and this app has proved invaluable. Used it in May to plan a complex trip around Central Asia to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan... worked a treat. I'd rate it 6 stars personally, download it!!",,,
2015,3,Easy to use and never crashes but it's prices are all too often incorrect when you go to check out. The bar graph prices are hardly ever available.  Quite a disappointing experience every time.,,,
2015,5,This app is just what i needed. . It help me in my bussy schedule to find flights and other good options ... loved it.... grt job....,,,
2017,1,new version does not allow anymore flexibility where and when to go... really upsetting!!! could you plz make it how it was?,,,
2015,1,"no matter what I search for I get no results. it seems they just want you to sign up. I switched the days, destinations,  everything. useless app.",,,
2015,1,"Although i really like the sky scanner website, the app is awful.  Getting stack and for the same search the results can be the relevant flights or ""no results"", in minutes.",,,
2015,5,The layout is excellent.  Clear option to opt for other agents selling same/similar tickets.  Impressive and practical.,,,
2015,5,"Works good, no bullshit n helps you find the best prices.. Barcelona Sydney 300 euros :) Catcha the sunshine",,,
2015,5,The app is working well and easy to use. It has saved us lots of money already. Thank you!,,,
2015,5,Hopefully some drop kick out there can learn from this app. It is very simple to use  and does a good job . The drop kicks out there who design some complicated app that is good for nothing take note of this one,,,
2015,5,"This app always has the best prices. I've booked 6 flights this year alone via skyscanner. Never had any problems with it. Allows you to search through to find the best dates, routes & prices.",,,
2015,5,"It's easy to use. I used this once and use skyscanner often to get cheap and reliable tickets. But, it would be great if you can make tickets sorting cheap 1st and then duration as second.",,,
2015,4,"I really love their search engine and the app had worked well for me. I wish there were more advanced search options, however.",,,
2015,2,"I have saved a couple of watched searches but when i go to search it wont let me, it stays on my watched searches. When I'm on the watched searches screen and I click the search tab, it stays on my watched searches and never goes to the search tab so I can't enter in a new search.",,,
2015,4,"This is a great app except i would like to see prices for every day, rather than the circle with the downward caret. Would also be great to search multi cities, but it's a free app so i know i can't ask for everything",,,
2015,3,It is a good  app  and  many  choices  but hard to find  full  details till you  give your  personal information .  I wanted to  choose the airline  with  30 kg check in  baggage and  couldn't  find it. I  decided to  look  some other agent  and found  what I  wanted.,,,
2015,5,"Love this app. Best prices on airline tickets. Compare pricing, watch for price changes, book flight and even pick your seat! :-) no fees for booking throughout Skyscannet!!",,,
2015,5,"Sometimes not super accurate, but extremely useful to save you time. The app is just as good as the website! Really well done.",,,
2017,2,WizzAir flights do not show up in this app while in others I can see them. WizzAir is low cost and for certain destinations a good choice.,,,
2015,1,It says this app requires internet connection check your setting i have checked it the internet is working fine i dunno maybe there is a glitch my phone is note 4 lollipop updated,,,
2015,1,Skyscaner is good for to search price but sorry to say when we click to buy the itenary there no such itenary  for e.g.mum - JFK - mum it showed Egypt air as mum Cairo Egypt air 39 hrs flight & JFK mum air India non stop flight but we click it shows both ways Egypt air here there is no option to post screen shot as proof..,,,
2015,5,I simple love it. I went to south america trip for 5 months by finding incredible cheap tickets from skyscanner. Thank you,,,
2015,5,"Love this app, due to ease of use and no commission pricing so you always get a good deal. Thanks and keep up the good work",,,
2015,3,Once I click to book the prices already raised and now when I click search it takes me to the watched screen so I have to go search on a computer to save it to my watched list on the app. Haven't attempted to book through it yet.,,,
2015,4,Seems to do what is says. Proof will be seen when I try and buy flights at the prices shown. I might come back and change my rating!,,,
2015,2,Have booked 3 flights using Skyscanner only to have the flights cancelled. Got my money back two weeks later but had to buy more expensive flights in the meantime.,,,
2015,4,Easy-to-use and helpful! No issue so far. Bue haven't done the booking yet.. Let's see later!,,,

2015,5,Easy to use. Not like windows8 lol. Easy to filter flights. And cheapest prices on app. Thanks builders,,,
2015,2,"The idea is great. The app is good. But the problem is that prices are not accurate. When you use the time line and select dates, the final prices always changes.",,,
2015,5,"It does what I need it to do. The best feature is that I am able to look at prices on a big scale, so I can optimize my economy.",,,
2015,4,Very easy app to use and very helpful...just a very slight change in prices when connecting to actual company. Have used the app to book car hire and flights a few times.,,,
2015,5,This app lets you plan round-trip purchases by seeing the prices in a range of dates and choosing two. It is exactly what a flight app needs to be. Great work!,,,
2015,5,Great app which I use to book all my flights!  Love the ease of use and the option to set up price alerts.,,,
2015,3,"It's a good app, except I got one price for a return journey in the app , and a another one on the wizzairsite . Difference is more than double .. from 130 to 290 pounds from app to website .",,,
2015,2,When you're logged in and you try to access the search tab it's always bringing you back to the watched one. It's impossible to perform new searches please fix.,,,
2015,4,"Great app, I use it frequently as I am required to fly at least 2-3 times per month for work and need convenience and affordability.. this assist with both.",,,
2015,5,The best. You can look by month if you wish. Especially like the 'watch' feature.,,,
2015,4,Could be made better by adding an anywhere field for departures for people who are travelling and could leave from most countries in Europe etc. Also it would be nice if there were prices for all dates when you searched for tickets in a whole month.,,,
2015,1,"The app opens fine, but informs me that i need an internet connection to search for flights. I do in fact have connection, 4G. Shame.",,,
2015,4,"Not able to see who operates flights on the overview like you can on the actual website. Otherwise its a brilliant, smooth and fast app",,,
2015,1,This app is not fair to Delta and excludes flights. I did a number of searches on known Delta routes and NO Delta flights came up. Very bias against Delta.,,,
2015,2,"This is the first time for me to try this app , but unfortunately , the price are inaccurate , for example : I filtered the search for 3 adults and 1 child , the cheapest price was 3011 GBP each, then i changed it to one adult and the price was 2099 GBP , I was hopeful when i installed the app , i said maybe this is the perfect app for me , but i realized its not.",,,
2015,1,App does not work i tried 3 different locations and keep getting no results. Save yourself time don't download this useless app,,,
2015,4,Use it all the time. Love how flexible the dates and locations are. Pick a location and no date to see when it's cheapest to go. Pick a date and no location to see where is cheaper to go in a specific window.,,,
2015,3,Not having multicity highly hinders the use of this service. Please focus on what matters the most for your users.,,,
2015,5,Absolutely blows the competition away! Finds you deals you can't get anywhere else!,,,
2015,1,I searched with 2 other apps and got a host of flights to choose from.  With this app there were no flights listed at all.  Glad I didn't just rely on this app.,,,
2015,4,"Unlike other apps who ask for so much info and only give you a limited amount of info, this app is fab. It allows you to see a wide range of dates to travel. Deffo try this.",,,
2015,5,"Loving the price alerts, would have booked at full price until I found the Skyscanner app. Registered for price alerts and same flights were just under ¬£100 cheaper for the two of us within 4 days.",,,
2015,4,"So far so good, no extra fees, and competitive prices. Good tool for travelers",,,
2015,1,"Could not suck any more...promises you one rate, then transfers you to the carrier's site to try to screw you out of more money....DON'T do it!!!",,,
2015,5,"Use it for a long time, and mostly happy with it, but some features, i.e. hunting for few similar tickets within one request would help (like cheapest weekend tickets Moscow‚ÄîTallinn‚ÄîMoscow in 2‚Äì3 mounts, etc).",,,
2015,5,The search option is one of the most flexible I've seen. It has helped me a bunch when looking for flights.,,,
2015,5,"I'm half way around the world, using only Skyscanner to reserve flights -- many the night before.  It's been perfect!",,,
2015,4,I like the widget that you can put on your home screen. It monitors any flights that your are thinking about going on.,,,
2015,5,Finds flights that you can book on airlines unmentioned by Orbitz or travelocity. Works sweetly in Europe too.,,,
2015,4,Great app. Found very inexpensive flights and hotel. I will use again and refer this to my friends and family.,,,
2015,4,Is there any possibility that I can search for flights with multiple destinations and not just round trip?...because there are times when I need to go to another country which is different from where i came from...thanks...,,,
2015,5,"Fast,friendly and simple. I've booked some brilliant deals with this app.",,,
2015,2,The extreme difference between the prices shown in the graphical interface and the actual prices is very frustrating. Deceptive?,,,
2015,1,"Every single search that I did says ""no results.""  This app is useless. I'm soo disappointed.",,,
2015,5,And i love the everywhere anytime feature. Too bad i cant seem to pay through the app.,,,
2015,5,Air Asia is not listed.... So as many other air lines which provides cheaper rates. Correct this mistake.,,,

2015,5,Awesome app use it for all my travels...zimbabwe...portugal e.t.c.,,,
2015,1,The only flights that it found was one called (no results found ),,,

2015,5,Perfect for finding cheap flights for that last minute getaway.... love it,,,
2015,5,This is great for planning and booking. Very clear and easy.,,,
2015,5,It is the best flight comparison application that I found. I used to love the website but you really nailed it by this great application.,,,
2015,5,"This is a great, very easy way of finding super cheap flights.",,,
2015,5,Always lets me know when I can get a cheaper flight.,,,
2015,5,"Always book here, it is the best travel search engine ever",,,
2015,5,I wish their Web site had the day by day cost comparison.,,,

2015,4,I would recommend it to anybody traveling international,,,
2015,5,Great flight app provided.best information I love it,,,
2015,1,What type of airline booking app doesn't check seat availability in this day???,,,
2015,1,Couldnt enter destination other than everywhere  yuk,,,
2015,5,This definitely the beat app for flights searching ever,,,
2015,5,Muy buena y r√°pida para encontrar vuelos a buen precio.,,,
2015,5,Gives a complete information on air fare on any day of any month,,,
2015,1,"Nothing but headaches. I have used it twice to make reservations. First time, I had to re-book with the airline, since the reservation hadn't actually been made, and the confirmation number I had wasn't recognizable by the airline's system.  Second time, I was trying to make reservations for two people, leaving on different flights and returning on the same flight. Very difficult to even do this, then even worse to get the payment through their system. Received an email indicating that the flight had not been booked, so called their support number, and was told the flight had been booked, even though the credit card authorization they said was necessary never had been given. After about three and a half hours on the phone, reservations were made. Have now renamed this app Skyscammer,  and removed it. Never again.",,,
2015,2,"Constantly running in the background. Even after forced stop. Draining battery and probably sending data! I only used this app once, but my power saver app has to shut this down EVERY time i run the power saver - which i run several times every day. Sick of it! UNINSTALLING!!",,,
2015,1,Been using skyscanner for a long time but when I have a new phone and installed it again i can not use it. It says that there is no connection although I've checked my connection several times. I've also changed the location and the currency but it didnt work. Please fix it.,,,
2015,5,"Clean and brilliant UI, fast and lightweight, and ads free! The most valuable app I ever seen. And even has Vietnamese language. I recommend this app for every traveling lover out there. There is only one thing that I believe would make this app more great. That it let we choose threshold of depart and return day for cheap flights if you guys understand me.",,,
2015,4,"I love how flexible this tool is. Yes, you have to take the results as a guide, but it gives a great idea if you're looking for a cheap flight. More frequent updating of prices, plus a rough indication of extras (mainly hold baggage) would give it 5 stars.",,,
2015,3,"Tried checking flights from Adelaide Australia to Bangkok. No direct flights exist so this is a test of trip duration (pass) and whether you can select the stopover airport (fail). Multiple airlines are allowed, but you cannot select which ones (fail). Flying Qantas from Adelaide to Melbourne, then Thai Air to Bangkok, is an option that doesn't exist...",,,
2015,3,"This app was amazing before they started forcing you to use third party companies (that charge additional fees) to purchase tickets. I used to use Skyscanner to find and purchase airline tickets all the time; but, after I was duped into paying some company $50 more for a ticket than it was worth, I began using it as a baseline only. I search for tickets using Skyscanner then purchase my tickets directly from the airline. Lesson learned!",,,
2015,2,"Calendar view price is consistently less than actual price. By considerable amounts (difference &gt;$50 and at times &gt;$100). Have not found a single accurate price, with multiple airports. Waste of time?",,,
2015,5,"I have been using this app for over a year now and must say it does exactly what I want and fairly easy to navigate. I don't use the purchase option so I can't rate or comment on that section of the app, I simply use it to narrow my dates and airline down and then purchase from a website that I use regularly. And the price always matches that of the website I use. 5 stars from me.",,,
2015,2,"When I search KUL &gt; BKK, in the app, you purposely don't show the budget airlines. But the budget airlines are available in the desktop version. I checked all necessary settings but to no avail",,,
2015,3,Hi I have a problem with the chart..I tried the search for a whole month. For most of the searches I do I see only one or two price options. Sometimes I don't see any price options. What can I do to fix this?? Thanks,,,
2015,4,"Hey Skyscanner, I want to ask if you guys can search more airline providers, like United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, or Hawaiian Airlines? Please add these awesome airlines for us to get THE BEST DEAL!!! üòÄ‚úà‚úà",,,
2015,4,Great Meta search app. figures out all possible cheapest flight options. Worth spending time to dig out best deals..,,,
2015,5,"The single best feature is that you can select dates for when you want to fly and the destination can be set to ""Everywhere"". Instead of looking for the lowest rates by city, you can then scroll the results by the lowest price to hundreds of cities in the world. Try it once and you'll be hooked.",,,
2015,5,One of the few tools that don't require a fare search by dates. Sometimes travelers can go anytime. They just need to know the cheapest option.,,,
2015,4,"Needs an easier more flexible interface, but very good. Some low cost airlines in the middle east do not appear in search results.",,,
2017,1,Crap.  No option to choose return flights other than the near future. Or explore feature. Better on ios.  Forget about this app better to use the website.,,,
2015,2,The calendar prices aren't even close to the details when I pull up the available flights on certain days. Completely useless if that's going to be the case,,,
2015,4,Love that I can search anywhere and just check out the prices and watch certain flight prices. Cleaner UI and some more search options would make it a 5 easily.,,,
2015,4,"Very easy to use, never had any crashes and it can give some very nice prices. Sometimes it's still better to check individual airline pricing via thier websitr though before actually booking.",,,
2016,1,teruk..update ptt makin memudahkan..tp ini sangat teruk dan menyukarkan..not friendly user...mohon kembali pada paparan lama..,,,
2015,5,I prefer the mobile app over the desktop version! The multi screen view is great for trying to find the best price over multiple airports or dates!,,,
2015,1,"Every flight I put in would come back with ""no results"", really? No flights from TUS to BOS next month, I don't think so...it didn't matter the flights always ""no results""",,,
2015,3,"Even if selecting direct flights only, the results say, ""hidden,"" forcing to remove filters.  That means one has to scroll which is not ideal on mobile device",,,
2015,4,Great app. But I would like to see a smarter search engine (eg. departure date +- 3 days etc.),,,
2015,5,This app is just what I need as a frequent traveler. I tried many of my destinations and it gives very accurate info. It will save me hours of planning. Thumbs up.,,,
2015,4,I've been searching other websites and I feel like I've found cheaper flights on those search engines. I do like how it'll keep watching a flight for me,,,
2015,1,"Just downloaded app, carried out a search and I'm told I'm using an old version update to the latest..... I've just downloaded it",,,
2015,5,This is better than any website out there.  Free and very easy to use!  I can't wait to see the world!,,,
2015,5,"Made searching for hotels, flights sooooo much easier. Fast and easy. 5 stars from me.",,,
2015,5,That's about it. The best. No interest. Ads are not naggy. Scans relatively fast and real-time.,,,
2015,4,I think that the prices on the search should be more accurate. very often you select dates and when you hit search airlines it is almost aways more expensive...,,,
2015,5,"I already booked 6 flight's thru this app, it was always the best price! I searched all other websites and skyscanner was always the best! Love it!!!",,,
2015,4,Muy buena app y rapidisima..la recomiendo y es amigable..consegu√≠ buenos precios a veces mejor que en la misma aerolinea..aunq puede mejorar le falta la opci√≥n de m√∫lti-city y a veces  los precios cambian dicen uno ahora y al segundo cambia..pero definitivamente mejor q cualquier otra app,,,
2015,1,"I book through this app, I found out that it's more expensive than the other sited...really disappointed with this app.",,,
2015,5,I don't travel without using this app now.  It's ridiculously useful.  Keep up the great work.,,,
2015,5,This app is great for searching flights wit results from various airlines.  I found flights sometimes cheaper on here then on the airlines website. Recommended,,,
2015,3,"Well, I do like this app though did not see much price gaps for india market.",,,
2015,5,It allows me to use multiple search windows and checks all the airline sites as well as other sites for the best price. Love the price alert emails.,,,
2015,2,"What happened to the widget? When I always see No Internet Connection, I tried to reinstall the app and after that, I no longer can find the widget.",,,
2015,2,"just another flight app, not best prices, not best options, no alternate suggestions.",,,
2015,4,"it would be much better, if it allows to search multiple cities & open jaw ticket as well.",,,
2015,4,Skyscanner search gives cheap search but they have to exclude some companies that shows fake cheap price as bait,,,
2015,5,Before using this application I had spent a lot of extra money on my flight bookings. This application helps you find the right price for you.,,,
2015,4,"It's a very good app., and gives iteration for most of the airlines ., yet it has to update interior European routes.",,,
2015,4,Would rate 5 stars if there was a +/- 1 or 2 days option.,,,
2015,1,UN effective .. only one flight the other flights is hidden,,,
2015,5,Its been so easy to book a flight since i use skyscanner... great apps,,,
2015,5,Not only find a cheapest ticket but provide all other alternatives. Especially bar chart helps the most which i think brilliant idea.,,,
2015,4,I love it at first time i installed it till now...keep improving,,,
2015,4,I would have given 5 stars if it showed the option for multi- destinations,,,
2015,1,Tried to search my flights but it's doesn't show at all,,,
2015,5,Lot of options and nice design of the app. Would love it if multi stop options are available,,,
2015,5,"It compares to all the options u can have, agents, airline's, better than last minute, Expedia and the own airline, great website",,,
2015,5,"Very good,  I find all local flights and also cheap long distance flights. Ty",,,
2015,5,Does what it is supposed to. Finds flights quickly and transfers you to the appropriate site seamlessly.,,,
2015,1,Multiple searches for pretty standard routes with no results each time.,,,
2015,5,"Super app.. does exactly what you want, what more could you ask for.",,,
2015,5,"I travel a lot, and this app has saved me so much time and money.  I highly recommend it.",,,
2015,5,I have found it one of the best ways to find a cheapest price for a flight.. High recommendation,,,
2015,5,Excellent easy-to-use price alerts. Everything you need,,,
2015,5,"I'm an avid flight price hunter,  and this is the best app I've found yet.",,,
2015,4,"Basata su volagratis, utilissima per i viaggi con date flessibili, un po' scomoda per itinerari round trip",,,
2015,5,You can check out flights from anywhere in UK to anywhere in the world to grab a bargain. Clear and easy to use.,,,
2015,5,"If you ever need to look anywhere else for your flights, you're using the app wrong ;)",,,
2015,5,If you have been searching the best prices for travel and intend to receive  alerts about opportunities. This is the app,,,
2015,5,Its a nice app but i would love to have more companies there since i have noticed that the low fare companies are not there.,,,
2015,5,Very easy way to find the best fares and to track them for a later purchase.,,,
2015,5,Definitely the best and lightest (on memory) travel app on android,,,
2015,5,One thing I'd like to see is have the ability to search via Frequent Flyer program,,,
2015,5,I downloaded so many software for flight tickets booking but this one was best ever I seen ...thanks for who made this software,,,
2015,3,The daily prices on the chart are nowhere near the prices in the search.,,,
2015,5,"Best travelling app, excellent for multiple connections.",,,
2015,5,Really useful. I use it as a reference for all the flights I book.,,,
2015,5,If you ever tried to find the cheapest ticket no matter what the destination is - this is the app for you,,,
2015,5,Great app! Whereever you are flying to make sure you check this app out,,,
2015,4,Vale a pena baixar... Para viagens internacionais √© o melhor...,,,
2015,5,I hope there would be a feature that allows us to sort/filter based on aircraft type and layover time.,,,
2015,5,"An update we can all use, get notified via Google now cards when the price of your flight drops!",,,
2015,5,Saved me a lot of time and money during my travel to Thailand.,,,
2015,2,"Comparing prices on here is good because it shows potential to be cheaper. Although, expect to pay little more when booking the actual flight(s)... The problem I had was the Chrome browser on my S5 warned me about safety concerns. I ignored it initially and tried to continue booking from the ""Travel2Be"" website. There was no website found. I searched for the website on my desktop; nothing. Really sketch when it comes to booking.",,,
2017,2,"I originally gave skyscanner 5 stars, because you could search 'anywhere' for inspiration, and you could then scroll through an entire years worth of dates in a graph style to find the absolute perfect flight. Now you have to pick a specific country, and specific dates for your initial search which you can then expand to no more than a month - and the visual graph style pricing is no longer there. I have no idea why they would downgrade so horrifically. Deleted this app within minutes. So disappointed.",,,
2015,4,"Simple interface, good range of results usually, even though some can be absurdly expensive and indirect routings the further down the list of options you go -- but hey, they're options! Seems to offer the best range for European flights in the apps/sites I've tried so far.",,,
2015,3,"Similar issue as other reviews: shows one price on the search list and then a much higher price in the book screen.  The problem is with flights that have multiple segments operated by different  airlines.  You guys need to ADD.   Please do not use a caned reply to contact you - your app - you can contact me.  Otherwise,  cleanly done and is very useful.",,,
2015,3,"The app is ok to have an idea of how much a flight is but The web versi√≥n is superior in every way. It is even faster using the mobile browser than the app sometimes. The app has a lot of potential, but it is nor yet fullt realized",,,
2015,1,"The everywhere option is not working after the last update. It just shows a list of countries, and I have to click each to find prices. The same goes to the month option, I have to click on every day to find prices and I no longer have access to the comparison.",,,
2015,1,"Everywhere I search, nothing but US Airways flight options out of RDU. Did  a quick check online to compare same search dates and destinations, always finding cheaper flights with other major airlines. Would be nice to see this app when it is up to par with web searching.",,,
2015,4,"Great app, used it to book flights to London and Madrid. Great resource. I did Google search the sites it told me to use to book the cheap flights and used that to make my decision. It better to book via an actual airline/ generally well know website and not any of these new unheard of 3rd party websites.",,,
2015,3,"Great and intuitive usability however, After updating the app when I try to search for flights I get the message that my version is out of date even though I have the latest version. This prevents me from getting my results. Navigates me back to the search page.",,,
2015,2,"Trying to show return flights. Clicking return defaults destination to another one. Cleared cache and searches, same problem. Can't use the app anymore because every return search defaults to KH-Cambodia. No idea what's going on.",,,
2015,5,"Been using Skyscanner for a while now, great handy app. Clean UI with really easy navigation and filtering system. The only app you need really to plan your holiday flights!",,,
2015,2,"Searching flights to Tokyo. The app shows you one price but when you click on it you get a totally different price. I've seen a lot of people complain about this for a long time,  it wasn't always like this please fix it.",,,
2015,2,New update only shows flights from Southwest only. Before showed all major airlines not sure what happen but shopping for a different app now.,,,
2015,5,"Fantastic information on the most inexpensive flights quickly on one site. No need to go through individual sites.  Easier to use than Priceline, Expedia,  etc.  Haven't booked a flight yet but plan to at some point",,,
2015,5,Thanks to skysanner for finding the lowest flight ever! I was hopeless the past coupla days! Thank goodness for this app! 100 more stars to skyscanner!,,,
2015,1,"Always show ""You are using an old version of the app. Please update to the latest version."" Uninstall then install but still show the popup again.",,,
2015,4,I have extensively used this app always give good results. Best feature it will give you price every 24 hrs .,,,
2015,1,Bait and switch. A total waste of time. ON THE FLY. App is reliable and current.  Doesn't give you prices then you can't book them at that price,,,
2015,1,For how many millions of flights in a day it shows no results. It sucks my day. Thank you,,,
2015,5,Easy to use app and great navigation through the different opinions. I've been using the site for years and will now use the app as long as it doesn't start to get buggy.,,,
2015,4,Let's see how the app runs after the update. Will re-rate later.,,,
2015,2,"Why are the flights/prices I choose never available when I go through to the next page? One way flight is dearer than the return I selected in the planner,,,, ALWAYS, fix it!!!!!!",,,
2015,4,"It is a very useful tool, however, it laks the possibility of multiple stops search and quite often price are not shown on a flexible date mode.",,,
2015,2,Gives good prices then tells you that ticket is not available and jumps the cost up handsomely.,,,
2015,4,Useful that can have multiple tabs. Cheap prices and easy bookings,,,
2015,5,Booked most of my flights for the last year on here no major issues. Don't know how I managed without it!,,,
2015,3,"When direct us to the website error or on the website itself , last part of key - in the credit card part got error too",,,
2015,1,Orbits gave me cheaper tickets 100 bucks less. Going from New York to Seattle and from Seattle to new York the ticket on orbit was 360 and here 468.,,,
2015,5,Great app to search flights. From planned to spontaneous trips this app will get you there!!,,,

2015,4,"If this apps can be used for multi cities flight booking, then it will be a5 stars from me",,,
2015,5,The best all round flight search tool I've ever found.,,,
2015,5,Very useful when i have to look for a few airlines for my vacation flight,,,
2015,5,I used this app to book for my flights and search  for deals as well!!,,,
2015,1,"this app is pointless. thought it was nice that i was able to scan through the days and pick the cheapest one, but when you initially go through with that ''deal'' you think you're getting, the price of the flight comes out to be $50+ MORE than what was said. overall, takes more work than any other ole app.  will not be using one that gets my hopes up by lying.",,,
2015,5,"**UPDATE - Glitches happen, but never have I had such an immediate response to a problem. I hope they have this weird issue fixed with a later update.  For now, I will search on any day but the first.  Thanks for a wonderful tool that I use daily, and thanks for the honest and prompt customer service.  5 star app in my book.  Kind of a must have for a world traveller.         -- The problem:  This used to work fine, now the update constantly says the time zone is bad.  Please fix this as I used it all the time.",,,
2015,5,"I  fly 2 to 3 times a year and, I love this app. Sometimes there are exclusive mobile phone discounts. I have checked over and over again for better online deals and there are none, it's either the same our the app is better. It's convenient, easy, reliable, and complete. I don't use anything else anymore, I recommend it all the time.",,,
2015,1,"I had been eyeing flights on the sky scanner app and when I finally chose one from Buenos Aires Argentina to Miami Florida, I was connected with sky-tours. I put my card information in on this app and received an email from sky-tours, saying that they needed a confirmation code from my bank. I called my bank and the bank said they didn't know anything about a confirmation code, then I was sent an email asking me to send a picture of my credit card front and back and my government issued ID front and back.",,,
2015,4,Shows tickets that arent actually available a lot of the time. Would REALLY be better with a feature that let's you save that perfect flight you've seen. Just in case it's still there when you come to book,,,
2015,3,"I use this app strictly for looking up which airline flies where and when. I was disappointed when I found out that a lot of airlines are not included. Two of which I fly alot, Delta and Southwest. Why aren't their flights listed on this app???",,,
2015,5,"It's a fantastic app. Just a suggestion, if you could have an option for the user to choose how he wants the flights to be displayed for return journeys instead of displaying options as a preset price wise.",,,
2015,2,"Booked one flight through the app before i realized prices were listed in usd. My ip is Australia... cool design of app, poor experience.",,,
2015,3,"What a pity,  the application has good filters,  and you can keep favorites search.  But unfortunately the results of search are false,  and when you are redirected to the website of the seller,  prices and durations of travel are totally different (longer and more expensives).",,,
2015,4,A beatiful tool. But why at the end I saw a price of 41‚Ç¨ in the list become 52 opening the item and after I ended at 70‚Ç¨.,,,
2015,5,Easy to use and after looking at other sites seems to come up with the lowest prices. I like the feature where you can see which is the cheapest day to travel.,,,
2015,1,I used to rate this app but lately the prices displayed are false everytime i get directed to the site the price displayed changes by about ¬£1000. Think i will use alternative site such as kayak or google flight search.,,,
2015,4,"I will update review as used. So far ease use 5 stars, accuracy of prices 4 stars.",,,
2015,5,Been using the website for years now even handier with the app. Best flight price comparison tool out there.,,,
2015,3,Failure to search either by airport or country after updating the the latest version. Hope it can be fixed asap~,,,
2015,5,Very user friendly. Payment options also made very easy. Trustworthy app.,,,
2015,1,"I enter my details and receive prices for selection given yet when i am re-directed to the airline site the prices are ‚Ç¨60 to ‚Ç¨70 dearer, this site is a ""JOKE"".",,,

2015,2,"No multi city option, charts don't display, found cheaper flights on Google. Fail.",,,
2015,3,Seems nice but I didn't booked before thru it because I'm still not sure about the level of it's security  Also it doesn't give the option for multiple distances.,,,

2015,1,Did a search from FLL to PHL for August and no flights were found? This app is useless.,,,
2015,2,This program doesn't work for me anymore. Won't find any locations when I do a search,,,
2015,5,I use it all the time when looking for flights and it never disappoints. Thank you,,,
2015,4,I think it's ok for an app.  I wish there was more search criteria to narrow results but good functionality for an app.,,,
2015,3,"Very handy but noticed it no longer includes some airlines, e.g. Cebu Pacific Air.",,,
2015,5,The app is really user friendly and very clear! I love it,,,

2015,4,Great help since we are planning a trip in 2 months.,,,
2015,5,Is perfect for those times when you can afford to be flexible with flights and it's also so quick to compare different days/times/airlines,,,
2015,3,"Cannot get price alerts on the app, that is a pitty",,,
2015,4,Gives you idea to compare with what your travel agent is asking for.,,,
2015,5,"The best the easiest, the most convenient to visually look at n understand, AND purchase with. Used multiple times.",,,

2015,5,I never thought I would find cheap flights but thanks to this app I have and I love it.,,,
2015,5,"Status bar is not colour coded but otherwise, perfection.",,,
2015,5,My 'go to' app as can compare flight prices day by day then see immediately the multitude of configurations of flights and prices,,,

2015,5,Easy to find flight with different types of airlines.,,,
2016,5,This app save lot of money and time thanks skyscanner,,,
2015,4,I read a previous review that hinted at a similar issue. The calendar graph layout is amazing! However on the main search page you can only filter for Direct or Non-Direct flights. The filters for other things including # of stops is on a separate filter page. I want to view the calendar graph layout by 1 stop flights. Please put on the main search page the direct option (already exists) + 1 stop option (not there). The app is currently not nearly as useful for finding cheap 1 stop flights. Thanks!!!,,,
2015,3,"I'm not sure how people who rated this app 4-5 stars use it,  but it's not the same way I do.   The user interface and simple search is great,  but whenever I search for the entire month or multiple dates,  the advertised prices ALWAYS change when I click on a specific date.   Please fix.",,,
2015,1,"Doesn't show prices on phone, only shows a few prices on tablet. Both running same android. Better if price watch was for any day cheapest price instead of set DAT.",,,
2015,2,"Searched for a flight from Sydney to Perth, the app shows me the price was $407.25, but when I clicked book and it took me to the actual airline website, the price has gone up to $518. Very disappointed about it. Also, the prices are way  different when I search through the app and your website. One last thing, how can Edream still one of the provider on your app??? They are a dishonest company.",,,
2015,4,Works well for most! I think I may get a discount through southwest airlines though because I always find a better deal on southwest then I do from this app. I love how it has links to all of the airlines bag fees. Good job!,,,
2016,2,"Used to be useful and easy, now it's just a frustrating mess. Does find some flights though but the new UX should never have made it past beta...",,,
2015,4,"""Would you like to rate us on Android Market."" Seriously? I think it's called Play Store since 3 years now. Otherwise good app",,,
2015,5,"I experienced a problem with this app and my Nexus 5 previously, but apparently the latest version fixed the issue (I was on dalvik all the time). Thanks!",,,
2015,2,"App used to work great.  Now when I search all I see is United,  Southwest and a few others. I'm going from Atlanta to Dulles and they don't even list all the Delta flights!!!  Please fix your app.",,,
2015,1,"Could not get it to work. Very frustrating because it would never display flights unless I cleared all filters, which defeated the prose of the app.   Waste of time",,,
2015,4,"Overall, great app with great search and filter capabilities. Only downside was that the prices didn't match the site it pushed me to for final booking. Far better than any airline's search.",,,
2015,4,Have used the web n app versions. This is the best service for travel planning. Even beats google flights in some cases.,,,
2015,5,"3/16/15 -- Woke up to find a response to my review in less than 12 hours.  Uninstalling and reinstalling the app fixed the problem.   Great customer service!  App is very easy to use.  5 stars!  3/15/15 --Every time I try a search, it says my time and date are out of sync and to change my settings to use automatic time/date.  Problem is, I'm already using that.  Quite frustrating.",,,
2015,1,"Crashed every time I pulled up the calendar. Also, doesn't seem to be an option for multi city stops",,,
2015,5,"Works effectively and efficiently, I really like the whole concept and the app design has a logical and simple layout and process. Well done!",,,
2015,5,"I love this app. Unlike airline apps it is really quick and totally hassle free to perform multiple searches. I love the month to view facility, it's very well laid out.",,,
2015,2,I'm unable to search for multicities! Please update and add the option as it would appear on the desktop version.,,,
2015,5,Usefull tool. Limited reliability is to be expected for good reason. Strongly recomended for refference and even for ticket resevetions.,,,
2015,5,It works perfectly fine on Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Love it. Highly recommend.,,,
2017,4,Great app for finding flight options and best prices. I travel a lot and use it all the time to plan my trips.,,,
2015,4,This is a great app for checking flights would have given it 5 stars but seems to have frozen on me in the chart. Screen won't let me return to search .,,,
2015,5,"Very useful, user friendly app. Haven't bought flights through it, just checked availability.",,,
2015,5,"Love the smooth functionality of this app. Makes arranging value holidays, comparing destination and costs, easy. Uninstall after use to avoid spam.",,,
2015,5,I use this app and this one only after time and time again finding it the best in finding the lowest price flights for my business travel. I use no other. It is the best when stuck in an airport with cancer flights.,,,
2015,5,Fast and accurate! Wish it had a search 3+/- days option though.,,,
2015,4,After a new search it always asks me to refresh th page if I click on a flight even though I've just searched for it other than brilliant,,,
2015,5,"Really great flights search engine and the app implements all its advantages! The ability to put ""any"" in almost any parameter helps to find the optimal choice (like move the trip by several days to save money or even choose the trip destination based on price offers)",,,
2015,5,Easy and user friendly. Rates are not cheapest all the time but it had good search results,,,
2015,5,"Having tried out quite a few booking apps, this is the best. The prices you see are almost the exact prices you end up paying so it's totally reliable.",,,
2015,4,Its really easy to use. The filter also complete. Add more LCC airline will this apps greater!,,,
2015,5,I find this is one of the easiest to use to search by price.  Watch out that you contact the airline  right away to secure a good seat and you get the airline's confirmation code.,,,
2015,5,"It is a very good app. Still, multi city search option would be a very good option to improve it.",,,
2015,4,Works well. Why trawl through multiple sites when Skyscanner does it all with no drama.,,,
2015,5,Useful and nicely produced information for at glance info it is great.                          Thank you Devs üòä,,,
2015,1,while I am using the app. Also widget does not show business class prices,,,
2015,5,I love this app. Works great and you get the lowest prices available on flights.,,,
2015,4,It works exactly the way it says it does. I'm very happy with it.,,,
2015,5,The best application program across all platforms I know of for getting an overall view of current flight prices. Invaluable to cut through the walls of intended barriers to best flight prices.,,,
2015,4,Easy to check and book. One tool for all your trips.,,,
2015,4,"I experienced some very frustrating app issues at first, but now it is working fine. Good app so far.",,,
2015,2,Prices are way off then what it shows..Picked a prices that says 550 and get sent over to Fare depot and prices shoots up to almost 800,,,
2015,1,I asked my travel agent about traveling ticket from sernek to istanbul and it was 70$ but in your program it is 245$!!!,,,
2015,3,Complicated by sorting and by moving between the lists. By changing the date or the airport you have to go back to the main list.,,,
2015,5,It's great but two improvements I'd like to see in the next release are a) smaller size widget and b) filters  saved with watched searches,,,
2015,4,Go to app for finding flights!! Headline prices don't match prices you end up paying though.,,,
2015,5,"Very good, I used this app and I found the cheapest flight, I checked many sites but this one gave me the cheapest price . Thanks skyscanner.",,,
2015,4,Found the flight's I wanted and at a great price. Will use more often for national & international flights from now on.,,,
2015,3,Sometimes you want days in between legs to stop over.  Sort that out and five stars,,,
2015,4,"Easy and quick to find the cheapest flights, though sometimes headline prices and final results differ.",,,
2015,4,Great app easy to use and price alerts are helpfull to jwllkeep an eye on changes in flights,,,
2015,5,Great little app that puts all the flights and information as you need it.  Very tidy and display.,,,
2015,5,Been using for a few years find it an excellent app and I've purchased my great deals with it :) very pleased!,,,
2015,4,Nice app to the price of the best  flights but it's not accurate,,,
2015,4,"We used to be able to verify day by day with simple "" next previous ""arrows",,,
2015,4,"Good way to compare prices, routes and times of flights quickly and with ease.",,,
2015,4,It works so far but its on military time and I can't figure out how to change it.,,,
2015,5,Skyscanner is the best app for flights booking among all other apps previously booked from. Highly recommended,,,
2015,5,"I use this on a regular basis for local and international flights, keeps things simple and searches all the major airlines, brilliant",,,
2015,4,"Is not possible to search for flexible dates, the fares appear empty",,,
2015,5,This app made it easy to check flight fares and availability an ease. Awesome app!!!!!,,,
2015,5,"Lovely and friendly App. Easy to use, you always get what you are looking for",,,
2015,5,Helpful app for most traveling persons.Keep it up.I really enjoy...,,,
2015,1,Cheaper flights avail on net from airlines why bother with this app,,,
2015,5,Using this app from long time and can say it is best ever app to know best flight rates accoross diffrent airlines..,,,
2017,2,The price it displays does not correspond to the actual price later on the other platforms it redirects you...,,,
2015,5,"Love this App, always help me to find cheap flight.",,,
2015,5,"You'll love this app if you are a frequent traveler, Especially if you are flexible with dates and cities",,,
2015,1,I want to book a one way flight. Won't even let me do that?,,,
2015,5,Better than webste as could output chart with ticket prices.,,,
2015,5,Great cheap flights. Recommended to anyone booking a holiday,,,
2015,5,"Simple to use, simple to understand, what more could you ask for?",,,
2015,5,So easy to use and get the best possible price and flight,,,
2015,5,It is a very usful tool to get the best flight for you,,,
2015,5,Tell us the flight no and type of a flight too thank you,,,
2015,5,All I need for finding and booking cheapest flights.,,,
2015,5,Very easy to use and completes the searches in very quick time,,,

2015,1,they deducte the money and told we dhould wait many days through bravofly site.dont use this dite,,,
2015,5,Really helpful and always use this to to my flights,,,
2019,1,"When booking YVR to MCO for February flights for 2020 it shows you cheapest 15 airfares. When you go to book the $339Cdn return airfare,skyscanner takes you to airlines website . then tells you a price adjustment error and so u accept the new higher price and brings you back to the lower price that u initially wanted. But it never allows you to purchase your tickets AMERICAN & United have looked into it and said its the Skyscanner app. So ive decided to go to the Hopper & Agoda app.",,,
2015,2,Need to include more service providers like Ibibo. Descrepancy noticed in prices in charts and when actually see that listing. Watched category does jot refresh at all automatically. Will update my comments by good to average.. There is no refresh button.  Plus.. When we see listing prices are different what we see inside any particular selection.,,,
2015,4,This app is amazing but make sure all your booking info is absolutley correct before you finalize especially if you are traveling internationally. I read the calendar incorrect and put the wrong month in for my departure date for two different flights. After realizing it shortly after I had no choice but to make a change or be charged full price if I canceled. I was hit with 200 dollars in fees!! The cheaper the airlines the more crooked their policies. Be careful!,,,
2015,1,"I gave this app a great rating a week ago, but trying to book a flight during the past week has changed my view completely!  My ""slight moan"" that the headline price is not available when you go to specific airport details is now a huge disatisfier - in my experience, the headline price is rarely, if ever available!  I also experienced many occasions when, despite completing all the search criteria, I was presented with flights that were not available, or with an insufficient number of tickets available to match my needs (problems in this regard with Delta Airlines especially). Found Gotogate much more reliable after being directed there by Skyscanner,  so will use that in future.",,,
2015,5,"I rarely rate apps, but feel the need to thank the creators of this one. My wife and I are headed to Costa Rica, and for weeks had used the app to track prices. We had settled on paying between 1350 and 1500 for both of us. Woke up last Saturday, checked the app, and an unbelievable $977 popped up! I booked it right away, and can now afford a camera to take down with us. Thanks so much!",,,
2015,1,before you are able to see more detailed flight prices because the boxes were not as large as the new app. When it was more condensed you were able to see more multiple airlines and prices all at the same time. The new update is not close to as user friendly as before. Please go back to the way this app used to function.,,,
2016,2,"One of the features that makes Skyscanner a must for frequent travelers and bargain hunters is the ability to do ""Whole Month"" searches. But on this app you can only search by specific dates. 2 stars until it's a full-featured app.",,,
2015,1,I've been keeping an eye on a certain flight I'm hoping to take in February and the results kept showing me figures starting in the $767-$900 range. So of course I was delighted. But when I was ready to book the flight I wanted the price ballooned astronomically to $4k! I mean even with taxes and other charges what the heck?!,,,
2015,3,"After dev resolved my previous issue, all flights are appearing now i think.  But Watched feature seems buggy.  My watched flights would always disappear and i would have to do my search all over again.  Too bad,  it could have been a very neat feature.",,,
2015,5,"You guys did a marvelous job on this app. Saves me a lot of time. I found, however, that the hotel version is cleaner and more user friendly. Although I might have jumping the gun, because I believe you are keep updating this application time after time.  Thank you for a wonderful app.",,,
2017,4,App was good. I used to use for long time. In the recent times the ticket prices are consistently incorrect. Latest one was from Chennai to Bahrain.. May End dates. It gave incorrect prices. The airlines provided different prices. I deleted the app.,,,
2015,4,"This 'anytime feature' helps me to find a cheapest airflight ticket. Very good application to compare flight tickets among many airlines. However, sometimes the price shown in chart isn't same with result.",,,
2015,5,"This is a great App to help you find good travel tickets. I used kayak a lot, but since finding this I use skyscanner more. I like how you can put in your departure city and put anywhere for the destination, so you can see what deals are out there that you wouldn't of normally thought to travel to.",,,
2015,5,"The screen just goes white after selecting the app until it times out and askes to force close or send a report. Ive done both already. After reinstalling it several times and crossing my fingers, it is working normally now.  Thanks!",,,
2015,2,"At first this app seemed easy to use.  It found good flights but when I  tried to book them I was sent to a different site.  That site didn't have the same flights and I basically had to search all over again.   So I tried the CheapOair app, found cheaper flights and did all the booking within the app. I won't use this one again.",,,
2015,4,"There was some discrepancy between the fare the app found and what i was actually able to book.  Got a better deal on slightly different flight times,  so can't complain!  Thanks for a great app.",,,
2015,5,Skyscanner is a perfect app. for those who like to travel on a low budget ... it gives you all the available options for the flights and opens the sky for you to choose from :) ... I will definitely use it every time I need to fly ... thanks Skyscanner for making things that easy,,,
2015,5,Great at finding low fares which is all I want.  I prefer to book directly with the airline.  I have had no problems getting the rates found through the app. Love it!   -Using Samsung Galaxy S3,,,
2015,4,"Easy way to see prices variations and find the best options, a must have app. As improvement, the filters should be placed on the same screen as the results otherwise there is a lot of back and forth needed.",,,
2015,5,This app is easy to  use and very convenient. It saves you  the time of    having  to carry out  the  research  all in the palm  of  your  hands. Also gives you  options  so you can choose  what's best for  you,,,
2015,1,Tried booking using the app and was redirected to fare geek. Didn't provide me with my e-ticket nor did they charge my account after booking the flight. I looked for a flight with Kayak after my bad experience and I had my e-ticket within about 30 minutes of booking the flight.,,,
2015,1,"I liked this app, but why does it have to install as a service and be constantly running in background? I only use it very occasionally. I am sick of apps that think they're more important than the others, so I deleted it.",,,
2015,5,"Als het gaat om het vinden van goedkope vluchten is er geen betere app dan deze. Eenvoudig, onafhankelijk en duidelijk. Voorkeuren invullen, zoals vertrek en aankomsttijden, en meteen worden de resultaten aangepast. Mijn appsolute favoriet! *** Update 10 Jan 2015: Net GoEuro app getest. Deze vond de beste retourvlucht naar Athene bij Skyscanner!!! ***",,,
2015,1,Every time I search a flight I tick the direct box and it never gives direct flights. So far a flight to zadar in Croatia is gonna take me 25 hours with 2 stops from London. I'm gonna take the unicycle instead.,,,
2015,4,Nice and user friendly App that is a good guide to the fares you will get on other travel sites. Only booked a flight once from the site but found it very easy to navigate the booking process.,,,
2015,4,"It's worked great everytime, no issues. Used it all over and it gives good prices. Sometimes carrier websites are a little cheaper but I mainly use SS as a starting point. Never leave home without it.",,,
2015,5,"I love to travel all over the world and this app does a great job finding the best fares from many sources including lesser known ones. It isn't always a 100% accurate in the fares it shows. However, this isn't something attributed to the app. Fares change frequently and not every source is diligent in reporting fare changes as quickly as others. That said, I highly recommend this app above all others.",,,
2015,1,$333 for round trip ticket from Denver to Kansas City. TripAdvisor has same flight $134. Hmmm guess who I'll never use. Rip off,,,
2015,5,Hands down provides the best prices for flights. Expedia and Kayak does not even compare. Great interface and very user friendly App.,,,
2015,5,Used it in airport to find quick rerouting options. Simple and fast. Would recommend adding multiple city/destination approach in the future. Cheers!,,,
2015,4,"Turns up more flights than I knew existed. Had some display problems, but a simple uninstall and reinstall cured that. My only quibble is that the airline names in search results are tiny and hard to read.",,,
2015,4,This will tell you the lowest price on any date on any route! Then u can directly go to the airline website and book the tickets! Helped me book the cheapest flights so many times. Must have app,,,
2015,3,"I wish it could find flights in more flixible manner. If there are no flights for specific days, I'd like the app to offer options.",,,
2015,4,"The app is great and easy to use for all user. However, the price shown in this app doesn't match with the price you actually pay because of service charge from some agency and credit card fee",,,
2015,5,"I find that this app allows me to plan flts according to airline,flt duration,stops enroute,shows highs and lows.  When i choose dates and flts destination allows to go to providers to book flights. Easier to find flts rather then kayak or others that make you select different sites to check prices.",,,
2015,3,"This app (and other flight apps) need to allow clients to select each leg of the trip rather than forcing us to choose only fron the 'packages' built for us. If you want a 5 star rating, then provide that at the very least.",,,
2015,4,"This app is great for comparing flight prices across a wide scope of different airlines and dates to find the cheapest options available. I don't always understand the chart view though (which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5) - for example on some days it shows the flights as being ridiculously expensive, but out of curiosity I selected one of those days, but still ended up with some relatively cheap options (it made me wonder what I might be missing out on because I tend to avoid those ""sky-high days"".",,,
2015,4,"This app makes it fun to plan vacations. I can find fares for virtually any location. It is most helpful, when trying to decide on a new place to visit.",,,
2015,5,I really like skyscanner it gives me plenty of options and choices.  Its really easy to use. Its saves all my favourite flight searches.,,,
2015,1,"This used to be a great app. Now, no matter what date, time or destination I select it says ""no results"". I tried uninstalling then installing. Same results. üòï",,,

2015,5,Booked my flight so easy. Good you can watch prices go down in certain time of the year. Thank you Skyscanner,,,
2015,5,This app is very helpful for flexible travelers like me and my wife. It shows the cheapest flights anytime during the year helping us save sometimes $1000. Great app!,,,
2015,3,After the new update it only filter 2 airlines. I can't change it to include other airlines. Help please?,,,
2015,5,"The app works perfect on Samsung S3. Excellent searching criterias, very good prices, no glitches. Thank you skyscanner team",,,

2015,3,"Been using it for a couple of years now, however I found that sometimes the site it directs you to, has more options at cheaper prices. Waiting for a multi destination option :)",,,
2015,5,"At first its little bit confuse, but then it helpfull. I will start my journey thanks to the app.",,,
2015,5,Just booked tickets for New York at the start of August for a third of the price both virgin and BA were quoteing!! The app is easy to use and takes you directly to your desired company to book flights at no extra cost!! Would highly recommend this app!!,,,
2015,4,"Nice app, live prices and always the cheapest. They could install a setup where I can get a price alert when something is below a certain price, that would be most awesome and demand increasing.",,,
2015,1,There is no way to stop the search bringing up dodgy travel agents like OmegaFlightstore. Don't use. Very untrustworthy.,,,
2015,5,It always finds the cheapest flights for me. Fast and super reliable!  Best tool on the market.,,,
2015,3,The app shows prices for international flights about 25% lower than when the dates are booked. This is highly suspect. Please fix this discrepancy.,,,
2015,3,I wouldn't trust the app for the lowest SYD-MNL-SYD flight fare...the lowest they provided was almost 1k when you can get one for as low as 700 on a CebuPacific direct flight...I'm no CebuPacific employee nor an endorser but it's just disappointing...I was hoping I would find a much lower fare than what CebuPacific is offering...,,,
2015,2,"The prices are not online, the earlier searching price is not match with the later one. Please update it and make it work.",,,
2015,5,"I was a bit discouraged because I waited last minute to book my flight, which meant more money. Not only did I save money but it was cheaper than what I was used to paying (DCA-FLL, usually $2-300, last minute about $4-550. I paid $120)",,,
2015,2,"How is it that this app is unused on my phone for weeks, and it's still draining 5-8% of my daily charge. That's not right.",,,
2015,5,"This app is great. Works very well, is easy to use and free. Can't ask more.",,,
2015,4,it is really a easy to use app with a nice usage flow and it provides tons of reliable information. Unfortunately the listed prices often turn out to be inaccurate though.,,,

2015,5,"User friendly interface, updated and great deals! Using for all my flights lately :-)",,,

2015,4,Not 100% accurate but truly gives me a very good idea at how much I'll be paying. Great app!,,,
2015,5,Like the app soo much. Just keeps it simple. Scans almost all the flights. So commission charged so cost is same as the flights website.,,,

2015,3,There's no result after update version. Please fixed this problem,,,

2015,2,"Recently noticed that the app prices are different from booking prices , used to be more accurate , disappointed,  I've  found some really good deals in the past .",,,

2015,1,Last time i see wrong prices only. In app and on web.,,,
2015,5,"Simple and easy to use, in my opinion better than the website as it shows the price for each day exactly. Love it!",,,

2015,4,"The app is amazing, but sometimes the prizes are not the same it says",,,
2015,4,"A great app to search for flights, save cost and time!",,,

2015,1,"I'm new to this app...Every choice I put in, no results.  Is there a fix?",,,

2015,2,"Web page is much better, the two find both different prices",,,
2015,5,"Even if I don't end up buying through this app or website, I always check it first for my flights.",,,

2015,5,Muy buena. La opci√≥n de busqueda con fechas abiertas es lo mejor,,,
2015,1,Why is it not possible to search for multi segment flights? Also on your web site?,,,
2015,5,Achei super pr√°tico e preciso. Pre√ßos j√° com encargos inclu√≠dos.,,,
2015,5,Funziona perfettamente ed √® molto utile.. Consiglio,,,
2015,5,La mejor aplicacion para comprar boletos economicos,,,
2014,2,"I think there are too much bugs with the software. First, I am not sure because of history or what reason, it did not shows up correct price. I tried to clear history but it still behave the same. Example: it shows lowest price of rm181 on particular day but I could not find this price at all when I try to retrieve price. Second, there are days shows up without price. 3rd the direct only is ticked but still returning search for both ways. Hah.... The 3rd bug happen after the latest update",,,
2014,2,"Prices when browsing sometimes differ few quid which is acceptable, but not from 100 to 300 jump. It is quite a lot of such a huge misprices around. Good feature could be viewing on the map option for a list of airports in defined countries. Sometimes i am just looking for cheap destination for 2 or 3 days. Have to browse where those airports are. Other thing is when selecting outbound flight, prices for inbound are changing. How that is possible? And it is not few quid, but from under 200 to 500! Shame.",,,
2014,3,"Used to think it was great now 1) it will show a price you think great that's a good deal, click in and the price jumps sometimes to more than double (noted by other reviews here)... 2) some of the sellers it links you to get terrible ratings on trip advisor etc - I want to buy a ticket with confidence I'm not going to get scammed... 3) also suggested here, multiple to & to search e.g from LHR or BHX or MAN for example (ITA matrix does it well)... 4) search business class and sometimes you get economy fares",,,
2014,1,"When booking my first flight this app send me to a website everything was find got a good price and something felt off. Flight was OK. But the credit card that I used for the first time and only time to book with this app was cloned and used in California. Now I'm stuck on vacation without my main credit having to used my savings, I may have to sell my camera or cell phone and messing up my plans. I'm not in the us where can go to the bank. Don't used this app unless you want the risk.",,,
2016,1,"UPDATED 7.20.16:  It's as if the people who are creating these updates have never even used their own app.  Getting rid of the search function to search 'everywhere' or just a specific country?  That's the only reason I've been holding out from the last major ""update"".  Getting rid of that feature makes this just another useless flight search engine.    Honestly, do you even think these things through, Skyscanner?  I'll be recommending other apps until this is fixed.",,,
2014,3,Not sure if some of the cheaper ones can be trusted having done some research and occasionally I am able to get a cheaper deal going direct to airlines site as I did earlier in the year to travel from Perth to New York nearly 700 dollars cheaper. It is handy sometimes to have the widget for a rough idea of prices. I almost booked with eDreams but a quick Google search told me that most people had a negative experience with them.,,,
2014,2,"Apparently, I got a flight booked but I didn't get a link to my confirmation. Didn't even get a receipt. Just a phone call asking if someone could charge my card, which seemed kinda shady. I had to look up the number to call the airline & do the leg work myself. Clunky and not really the most efficient app.",,,
2014,2,"Needs a quick fix. Works great on Data but not on WiFi. Always error message ""Search needs internet connection""  Previously ok. Otherwise 4 to 5 stars rating for apps. Reinstall as advised but same error msg. Can login by WiFi so nothing wrong with internet setting.",,,
2014,1,I will give one star to skyscanner because their partner traveltrolley is a fraud.. Once payment goes through they will blackmail you by asking a clear photo of your debit or credit card if you say no they will cancel your ticket and make you wait 2 weeks for refund and you end up canceling or changing your plan to travell. Stay away from dodgy TRAVELTROLLEY..,,,
2014,4,"Excellent service and excellent app. The app is so well crafted, it is actually better than the website! Three features they should add that would make it perfect: 1) search from/to multiple airports (e.g. from LBA or MAN) 2) multi-stop itineraries 3) filter airlines by alliance (e.g. oneworld, star alliance etc.)",,,
2014,1,"Does not work. Search a specific date, eg today, to go anywhere. Next page shows list of excellent prices for today. Next page shows a bar chart with prices for each day and not one day shows anything like the price shown on page 2. In other words the prices offered in the open search for a specified chosen day do not exist. If I did not know the main site to be good, I would say this is just a scam but I know SS better than that.  Screenshots available if SS give me an email address to send to",,,
2014,2,"When you pick flights by time slots the app opens your selection and the hours available for booking don't match your selection. If it says 10pm on the selection, it may say 8am for the actual booking. It's whacky. I hope they revamp and fix because the concept is great.",,,
2014,4,I always come to skyscanner if i am planning a trip.. it just brings up lowest fare and helps me to plan my travel. I even win arguments with my travel agent showing the prices listed here. Reason for giving 4 is non availability of Multi city option otherwise 5.,,,
2014,5,"Eg: I want to know fare for Singapore to Melbourne for entire month of December by Singapore airlines. Dec1st, DEC 2nd, 3rd..... Dec 31st.  Simply  rout from to to, airline, month finally I can able to see Singapore airlines price in that month with every day price for entire December month. Many people book flights not only based on cheap fare and particular date of journey . they prefer airline also. If u add this feature it would be a great time saving .",,,
2014,3,"MEA- middle east airline; one minute is on skyscanner and the next the booking is no longer available...they drop people after  booking process has started, and i wander why skyscanner allows this to happen!   Its very confusing when you see flights available but not real. Be aware when you try MEA! Not a honest airline.",,,
2014,5,"I always travel at least 4 big trips accross  the world every yead, and I always check flights in Skyscanner because the combinations they handle are just unseen anywhere else on the net. A little con is that they aggregate results of other providers so sometimes the don't have the update prices for the month view if nobody searched for that particular dates, but still they performance  and power of the tool is awesome.  Thanks for saving me that much money!",,,
2014,4,"I had both a positive and negative experience with this app however the company that I made the ticket purchase from was quick to make right the negative experience, so overall a pretty good app. It's a great search engine for finding up to date prices. The negative experience was (in my case) the delay in getting a confirmation for my flight however when I called the listed number a very polite representative was able to fix my reservation without any trouble. I will keep the app.",,,
2014,1,"Previously rated 5 stars but now it says there are not flights from chicago to Denver for the whole month of March. Also tried Vegas and ""no results"". Used to be my go to flight app but now doesn't work. I uninstalled and reinstalled, still not working.",,,
2014,5,"This is my ""goto"" app for locating the best deals on air travel throughout Eastern and Western Europe. The listed prices are seldom, if ever, beat!!! I have used this app to purchase tickets to Paris, Istanbul, Warsaw, Budapest, and many other places.   Its a must have for any globetrotting adventure.",,,
2014,1,"I downloaded this app, and tried to use the chart feature to look for better priced dates. It told me that one of the airports I selected wouldn't allow me to use this function... NYC -&gt; ATL??? What airports does this feature even work for? Completely useless.",,,
2014,2,"If you could add a possibility of searching from multiple airports in one area (Birmingham, Manchester, London Luton) to multiple airports (Berlin, Szczecin, Pozna≈Ñ) in another area by selecting few it would make it an ultimate connection app! Right now... nothing special.",,,
2014,2,"Prices look good for certain airlines, but usually you are directed to 3rd party websites that have a lack of information, have flight timings that don't match the actual timings on the airline's own webpage.  Do check for online reviews of these 3rd party websites before purchasing. The app itself is pretty useful as a gauge, but probably not the best for ordering tickets with.  Dear page admin, I do not need you to follow-up on this comment. I'll stick with buying direct or getting tickets from more reputable online sellers.",,,
2014,2,Clicked on Cheapest Fare $1100. Fare was confirmed $1100 and then taken to Helloworld Website. The website reported not available and best price $1375. Went back to do new search again with exactly same result. Can't trust the APP. Either the APP is at fault or Helloworld is at fault.  Waist of time. Have screenshots to prove it.,,,
2014,3,Trying to book my flights for next and awaiting a good deal. Two came this week couldn't believe the price but thought yes I would book now clicked on the booking icon when it took me through the price went back to original price so no good offer so I didn't book it,,,
2014,5,Great app!! Simply easy to use. Convenient interface and easy navigation. Only thing missing is multi city travel. You should include this to make it a complete one and only choice out in the market.,,,
2015,5,"This app provides me with exactly the right information I require.  It updates price fluctuations very quickly. And for me, a real TECHNOPHOBE, it is very easy to use. In my humble opinion it is the best app of its kind. Many thanks",,,
2014,5,Have now booked twice using this site and I must say it's brilliant. I find it easier than the airlines own websites to navigate. Its straight forward and idiot proof.....good for me.the airlines should take note of this.simple ticket booking from my phone.......well done five stars from me.,,,
2014,5,"Skyscanner is the most thorough way to search for flights, especially in Europe. For best results use the website on a computer, use all option like 'whole month' and 'to everywhere' check prices on the actual site of bookers or airline and make notes with paper and pen.",,,
2014,3,"I have the same problem that it shows a price and when you click on it it shows different.. and just checked the app, the prizes are higher then website. Whats with that!? Really bad.",,,
2015,1,Can't email them have copied what they are promising on the price and the price goes up by 100s is an absolute joke. Can't find and email to complain to. Really let down by the site and I won't be using it again.,,,
2014,3,I use it a lot! It shows me different dates without submitting each one at a time. My only complaint is that the low price shown on the first screen isn't really the lowest price. I hope that changes soon.,,,
2014,5,"Amazing app , very much recommended for the people who travel frequently. It's helps in planning when you can grab good deal to fly. Once again AMAZING APP.",,,
2014,5,"You know when sometines you have an app that is what better than their own website?  Well that's one of them. Perfect,  works well and free. Thank for making it!",,,
2015,2,"Not sure why but booking from the app is next to impossible. Prices for international airfares jump by 40%+, whole flights disappeare. Waste of time",,,
2014,5,"So my advice is be ready to purchase rite away and you will be happy. Remember de are millions of people all over the world serching for the same prizes you searching. For therefore dont expect the same price to be there when you Google. Onto another site. Obviously by the time you come back the ticket you just saw would have gone, Honestly this is the best app. .",,,
2014,5,I love this app! &lt;3 works well and saves a lot of money! I highly recommend to use it before you book your next flight ;),,,
2014,1,"Put in all my info gave me an awesome price then...when I went to book it price MUCH higher!!! If I get a flight @ the price promised, I will change my stare rating. I have screen shots for proof.",,,
2014,2,I had been using this app to look for the best price available to take a trip for the past week. From one day to another?? The prices skyrocketed and now I see fewer carriers so my trip home is now double what I had thought is was going to be. Also it shows a price on the screen with all the dates and when I click it?? It doesnt show up on the list.,,,
2014,5,"This app is great - directionally. It'll give you the best days to fly. But you can find better sites with better pricing. At least it did when I compared Atlanta to Nassau at the end of February.   And to be fair, it could be an anomaly, I only checked the one destination.",,,
2014,5,This is my go-to app when searching for tickets. Simple and effective. Love the option to choose anywhere as destination to see prices for all destinations. Really liked that.,,,
2014,4,"Fantastic app, if you enjoy searching for cheap flights. Favourite tool is the facility to search for outbound flights anywhere over the next year and the app will tell you the cheapest places to fly.",,,
2014,5,For when you know where you want to go but have flexible dates this app is amazing. If you are trying to find a flight like tomorrow or that week you should expect a higher price but this app will help you find the best price imo. But if you see a price you like one day jump on it cause prices change daily. I've been watching prices for a future trip that have been dropping daily.,,,
2014,5,Best-in-class UI with tabs for different searches. Usually provides the cheapest flights. Price is consistent with booking websites. Covers many airlines and locations.,,,
2015,5,"This allows you to put your travelling dreams together. Can't see anything bothering about it, so solid 5 star rating. Thanks, Skyscanner!",,,
2014,2,It's great to find the somewhat cheapest flight. When I go to the chart section I see prices that are significantly lower than they are after selecting them. The numbers do not add up.,,,
2014,5,Saved me so much when I had to book a quick trip. Only app that come up with the goods to save my back pocket. Thank you.,,,
2014,3,A lot of the time they show a price and once you click onto it to book...  The price goes up...  Also how can you have a setting for baggage?? I can't book a flight AND a bag...  I always get screwed at the airport by owing more money for checking a bag...,,,
2014,5,"I traveled around Vietnam using Skyscanner without planning anything before. Good prices,no surprises. Buying the tickets directly from each flight company, without any extra fee. Possibility to compare prices across months. All you wish from flight app and more!!",,,
2015,4,"(1) information about existence of direct flight is often inaccurate and (2) I prefer the data visualization chosen by Experia for flight vs. transfer durations. Except from this, the app is a killer, very usable and providing very cheap fares ~",,,
2014,2,Its a great website and the app does it's thing but why does the app need access to all my media including my pics videos and sd card? Somehow toesn't sound legit(?),,,
2014,3,"I have used skyscanner a dozen time but every time I want to check multi city flights I have to use a different app. Also, sometimes certain retailers will display lower price until you go to their sites and the price increases to almost double.",,,
2015,5,"Everything about this app is flawless. It has helped me find the best price in every flight, and works perfectly. Thank you.",,,
2014,5,Perfect app. I bought great deals through out of the year. Nice option to customize your dates and fares.I liked it.,,,
2014,4,I like the app.  But I had an issue setting up a specific flight.  The app thinks that the Sacramento international airport  and the Stockton airport are in the same city.  Kayak doesn't have this issue.,,,
2014,5,Nothing to report negative I have compared price quotes with 3 or more apps. Anyhow this is the best choice getting lowest prices nice fast search results keep it up and expecting more updates,,,
2014,5,Consistently got the cheapest air fare...... Nice app.  Would be nice to have the option of checking flights with multiple destinations.,,,
2015,2,This was my favorite app but now it won't work. It says select another airport but I've flown twice from Atlantic City NJ to Orlando fl booking with this app.,,,
2014,5,"Great app, very usefull. There is one little thing though, i would prefer a via-search option.",,,
2014,3,"Perhaps its useful for some research, but at least half the prices are way off. It seems like the price database is only updated once a week while airlines change prices multiple times a day.",,,
2015,4,"Since I always cross check prices on other apps/sites, I'd say I get full use out of skyscanner. I love using it to scour cheap tickets.",,,
2014,4,Fantastic service and it often beats competitors like Kayak on finding lower prices. To reach 5 star for me it needs to include multi-city flights.,,,
2014,5,Love this app! So easy to find great deals on flights. I use it all the time.,,,
2014,5,Seqrched and Booked many flights through this app with no problem. Thanks guys. Keep it up.,,,
2014,4,Great app. easy to use upto date and cheap enough. Thanks developer,,,
2014,4,Very good app... The only problem is that sometime the price found is not the exact one from the air company but still good :) I would advice it!,,,
2014,1,Really poor and overly simplistic app. Can't reset to start a new search with return flight. Full site much better,,,
2014,5,Its really cool app and works well with me I can get cheap and best fare with the help on my android.,,,
2014,4,I like it for finding average price and flights...  There's usually cheeper flights on priceline or some sight like that.   Great app though,,,
2014,4,Great app for quick info on all flights for any destination. .. rarely do they miss! I use it often.,,,
2014,1,Prices get more expensive (15-20%) once I submit the flights... even if I repeat the process several times.,,,
2015,3,Lg g3 icon missing could not search for it. Reinstall and icon still does not appear. Only way to load the app is through the app store click open. Please fix.,,,
2014,5,It always makes my searching for affordable plane tickets easy and convenient. Thank you Skyscanner!,,,
2014,5,"It is easy, effective, and efficient. No need to dawdle spending our time to call a travel agent for information or reservation, not to mention others. If U see what i mean... Skyscanner makes me feel, ""It's just a small world we've been living in..""",,,
2014,4,I doesn't list an airport near my parents.   VPS in northwest florida. Other than that I used this app for years and told friends about it.  Love it.,,,
2014,3,"With this application, I can survey the flight price easier and faster. Make me more alert in buying the flight ticket. Tq admin.",,,
2014,1,Every search I try produces the same problem: it errors out and can't search the airport I pick. No search results equals useless to me.,,,
2015,5,"After finding flights i always check with the airlines own site, up to now skyscanner has been 100% correct. Thankyou for this great app, its ideal for my needs.",,,
2014,4,I have had good luck with Skyscanner and although I have not booked through the app the layout seems very friendly and prices even a little better than finding something through Google.,,,
2015,4,"Good app.  Prices change sometimes when you select a package,  but sure easier than going on multiple carriers websites to find prices.",,,
2014,5,"Booked my first ever flights on this app Always been a bit confused by hidden costs and different rules for different airlines, but Skyscanner made things simple. Click, pick, pay, pack, play.",,,
2015,4,It's the first place I go to to get cheap flights on so the prices may vary slightly once you go through to the airline website but on the whole does what it says on the tin,,,
2014,5,So obviously if you see a great price and return the next day and its rocketed that's the airlines fault not sky Skanner! Love this app booked many journies through it!,,,
2014,5,"Simple, fast and easy to use. Great simplicity without compromise the features.",,,
2014,5,"Nice interface, filters work well, and I'm glad to see that the prices shown are actually the price you purchase for (used to be quite some differences in the past)",,,
2014,4,Only bad thing is that flight prices will double and cheaper options from other agents you can find online won't come up.,,,
2014,3,Most often the lowest price ticket leads to a sketchy website that doesn't honor the price.  Otherwise it's a very functional app.,,,
2014,3,"am quite confused why prices are different, I check the same destinations, same flights and same dates but I get different prices on the mobile app and On Pc. Website..",,,
2014,4,"I am looking for a cheap one way ticket to Victoria BC but having trouble with the prices so expensive, fine me one for Tuesday please",,,
2014,3,Please merge all the apps into one Skyscanner app. It makes no sense to have them separated.,,,
2014,5,Oh so smart. My wallet would like to make a special  thanks.,,,
2015,1,Everything is just ok prices are good but how can you guarantee me about safety of my money because it transfered me to ebooker. ..I am concerned about money !!!!!,,,
2014,5,I will use this app quite often. One stop shop for airfare. Great,,,
2015,5,It gives you the least expensive days of most airlines so one day you may be able to fly for 1100 but the next day you may be able to fly for 300 check this out my ticket to London with 350 dollars,,,
2014,5,This is an awesome app for flight search. Search options are pretty cool..,,,
2014,3,Why call the app flights in the app draw and skyscanner on here. Very difficult to find when you don't know!,,,
2014,4,"Good, but needed improvement on widget and notification.",,,
2014,5,Rolling chart of cost makes this an excellent tool for planning and getting the best deals for your holiday,,,
2014,5,"I have been using skyscanner to book and find the best deals on flights for years, it is so simple and efficient to use, can't fault it, highly recommended",,,
2014,4,Es de una gran ayuda y te permite comparar y esoger la mas favorable o la que mas te guste.,,,

2014,5,Its a unique app in android i can get cheap airticket with this app thanks skyscanner,,,
2014,5,Use it all the time. Useful feature plug in a date and prices to anywhere,,,
2014,3,If you use the month price graph you can see for example on one day 1000 dollar price and when going inside only 150 dollar,,,
2014,4,I would like a simple toggle to see the next or previous day views rather than going back and starting my search again,,,
2014,4,Random ....so ok it works but not sure you get any better deals....,,,
2014,5,I love this app! I had few great deals through this app!,,,
2014,3,I had some issues with selecting flights and making changes. I had to start from the beginning if I needed to make a change,,,
2014,4,"Some errors here and there. Worst part are the dead links, but overall, not bad.",,,
2014,5,This is by far the best way to search for flights online. Works.,,,
2014,2,There were many flights which the app showed but when I click book the site shows that no such fare exists,,,
2014,1,difficult to understand.  not user friendly at all!,,,
2014,1,"Will not reset to search, no matter what I try. Hopeless.",,,
2014,1,"Every flight I have tried to schedule says no longer available, when I go to the website.",,,
2014,4,Sometimes  when i look for flights it glitches  so when i navigate  backwards it goes to my phone home screen rather the previous app page.,,,
2014,4,Very good App for comparing fares on different websites and portals on one window .keep it up...,,,
2014,1,Every time I try to search it says not results or couldn't find any flight.don't bother to download .,,,
2014,5,It gets the objective done. Nothing bad to say so far about the app :p,,,
2014,4,"the app was ok to searching and compare , easy widget to book and swipe . most recommended.",,,
2014,4,If u can provide via (for non direct flights) option in search that will be more helpful,,,
2014,5,It does exactly what I want: gives me all the possible combinations to move from one country to another. Brilliant!,,,
2014,2,Flight prices jump each step of the way hundreds of dollars!,,,
2014,4,If there isthe function of alert for cheaper tickets will be wonderful!,,,
2014,5,Great app. Helped me put the squeeze on my travel agent & keeps them honest !,,,

2014,5,Thanks to this app I was able to save a couple of hundred dollars,,,
2014,5,Best way to look at a bunch of providers instantly.,,,
2015,5,The only issue is that some of the agents that are displayed give unrealistic prices.,,,

2014,4,"The app is great, allowing you to compare flights as of the previous hour. The widget is great too, as it allows you to easily see prices for a flight you are interested in right from your home screen. In terms of improvement, I would suggest 4 things:  First, the fact that you can make ""favorite"" flights is awesome, but it doesn't save filters that you put on that search. So right now, by having a flight a ""favorite,"" it'll remember the dates and destinations, but not any time filters I'd like to have. Secondly, they should have functionality for routine flights -- e.g. if I fly from Airport A to Airport B every Monday-Wednesday, it'd be nice to have a feature that will save that regular, routine trip week by week. Third, I don't know if it has this already, but there should be an alert system whereby you set a particular price and when prices drop below that, the app alerts you so that you can go ahead and buy at that price. Fourth (and this is a stretch), they should let you log prices day by day so that you can see airline prices for a particular ""favorite"" over the course of time. This will help in determining when prices are cheapest/most expensive",,,
2014,4,"Current version appears to have resolved earlier issues. Now works exactly as one would expect.  Request: enter your start and end point (not necessarily airports), it gives a list of ""best routes"" taking into account time, cost, number of changes etc. The weighting algorithm could be customisable.",,,
2017,1,"Utter rubbish now since they allowed third parties,was way better when it was direct with airline.  My daughter booked flights via Skyscanner, trip was cancelled within 24 hours, if she had booked directly with BA she would have had a full refund.  This lot she booked with took the whole ¬£490 saying it was non refundable.  So she is now out of pocket of almost ¬£500, and in tiny letters the company wasn't even atol protected.  Will go back to searching for flights the old fashioned way, but beware and read carefully if you are directed to a third party.  Shame on you Skyscanner what you had was good, not anymore.",,,
2014,4,"A potential great app. Very usable for comparing tickets prices. Fast and works reliably 70 %. 30 % of my search is inaccurate on price. Also, connecting flights seem have less amount than the possible flight you can make yourself with different Airlines. I hope Skyscanner team will resolve these issues.",,,
2014,1,"I used this app religiously when I had my iPhone, never had any issues. Now that I have the Galaxy and I downloaded the app it doesn't pull up any prices for me, no matter the location.  I've tried to do several locations and nothing, it just keeps saying no results found.  Please fix, I love this app.",,,
2014,3,"Feature wise 5 stars! World is is big hop on to any place which offers better flight deals. The feature of from certain place to everywhere in the search is awesome! But only problem is as many people are writing about .. the actual rates doesn't correspond to the displayed one! So 2 stars less!! Hope this gets rectified, I will give 10 stars !!!!",,,
2014,3,"It's a nice app. Interface wise and all that. But the basic problem is that when you search for flights the prices shown are out of sync with the providers. So the app shows a price and then when I select the interesting flight it connects to the servers again and the price has changed not in my favor. I understand this could happen sometimes but the issue is that this happens all the time, and the app does not even care to cache the new price, and still keeps showing the old price in the same search done.",,,
2014,4,I love skyscanner and always purchase my flights through them  this app is brilliant but one missing feature would be the price alerts! Which are on the desktop version. It would be great if they could add this and tie it into the android notification centre to bring up alerts even when not on the app,,,
2014,1,"Wanted to buy a ticket and was happy to see, it cost $150 including tax but service charge not included. But after service charge and payment mode added ... Total cost $235! At the end I bought from the airline website for $194. There is no such thing as no fee charged website. Very disappointed.",,,
2014,5,I was about to write an average review when I looked at the one below. It was an average review with a few issues. Someone from the company had responded to try and rectify the issue for the user very quickly. For me that was such a nice thing to see. Congrats tech support! Well done indeed,,,
2014,5,"If you're looking for flights, this has to be the best place to come. Some of the search  options are great when you are looking for vague searches, such as any place or any time. There are obviously a number of searches it would be good to see such as ""if I want to travel direct somewhere Thursday night to Sunday night, where's looking cheap this month?"", but perhaps these will come in time.",,,
2014,2,I used the skyscanner app with Nokia lumia and it gave wonderful search results. The results of this android app are not as perfect as the windows app. For the same search the windows app gives better and cheaper options than this app. Please check this flaw and update asap. That is why only two stars.,,,
2014,1,"It always shows you cheaper prices than you finaly get. Plus you have to enter the whole flight data again in the website they transfer you too. I will try in a week again, if still price cheating ==&gt; uninstall,..  Little change: I installed cheapflights. Prices on the dot and you do not have to re-enter fkight data. Uninstalled skyscanner...good bye",,,
2016,2,The older version is so much user friendly and easier to find flights. The new upgraded version is confusing and it just doesn't interest me to use the app anymore. Desktop versions are better. :),,,
2014,3,"Great app but just for a round trip, I love Skyscanner when booking my flight but the major problem is I can't book my multiple city flight with it which gives me a minimum opportunity to use Skyscanner.  Please upgrade this app. I will have given it 5 star but now just 3.",,,
2014,1,"Please add some Indian destinations where there is direct flight from Delhi like- Pantnagar, Kulu and Agra. Also, when you search From Delhi To Everywhere direct flights, you get to see so, many countries where there is no direct flight from Delhi. Syria, Tanzania, Ukraine to name a few. Could you please remove these from the list and make search more accurate.",,,
2014,3,"Prices are incorrect, almost always! If you're searching for domestic flights, know your carriers. Much easier to check 3 websites than be let down when prices are 100s more expensive. I travel frequently as does my partner, better to sign up for frenzy fares and price drop alerts for your regular routes",,,
2014,4,Doesn't always get you cheapest or best route but 98%of time gets  you where you want for a decent price. Only recently  though it will give you a price then when you click on airport or price it gives you a different price.  My husband and I were looking at same time.  He got  cheaper  prices than me.  However i aways use.,,,
2014,1,"Just tried to open app. Clicked on city I want to fly to, screen goes completely dark...Uninstalled app, reinstalled and it still does it. Using Galaxy S4. Disappointed...",,,
2014,3,Loved this application until today.  I wanted to book a flight... it was on Southwest Airlines and when I clicked on it... all southwest flights are no longer available. .. I can't find any way to reset it to previous settings.  I even tried to uninstall the application and download again.  So frustrated. ...,,,
2014,5,All flight deals at your finger tips. Would like to see skyscanner process booking as well. Don't trust 3rd party websites to give Cc info.,,,
2014,5,Anytime I even start to think about taking a trip somewhere this app gets pulled up first. It's gives me the best prices around and it allows me to customize many options for all my flights. I wouldn't buy a ticket without coming to this app first.,,,
2014,4,Your one stop shop for all your flight needs. Sometimes flight prices go up and don't include airline administration fees. But a great app looking at a rough idea of prices to new destinations.,,,
2014,4,I used this app both on ios and android and it works fine! I hope in future more airlines with competitive fares will be added to it as I don't find many competitive fares for South Asian destinations.,,,
2014,3,"It needs more features to deserve 5 stars, like I would like to have an option to see the prices for an entire week, or having multiple destinations option, select the best airplane or the most trustworthy website to buy my flight ticket.",,,
2014,4,"Love the app, no complaints there. However, I spent a while really confused by not being able to find the app in my app drawer or settings. Eventually realised, I think by accident in the end - don't call it ""Flights"", call it Skyscanner!",,,
2014,3,Do you need access to my files and images? Please address so I can re-install. Location I understand.  Thanks,,,
2014,5,This is my favourite website and app for planning a flight if my dates are flexible and I'm looking for a deal. I love the way I can compare prices on different dates and their prices are the best too!,,,
2014,3,Love the cheap prices. But the number to book tickets on the phone isnt connected?? im worried its not legitimate,,,
2014,1,"Searched for few flights and the price shown on the app was almost 200 less than the actual ticketing site in one case and 400 less than the site in another case, the ticketing site being bravofly. This defeats the purpose of using skyscanner.",,,
2014,4,"Very useful, but if I want to shift same flight to one day back or further I need to go back to search and change date. May be it's better to make it like swipe somewhere, but may be it's already there and I just not found it )",,,
2014,5,I love the fact the I can compare lots of different prices and journeys. However it is makes me want to just pick up a leave and travel for the rest of my life. Brilliant app would definitely recommend it to anyone!,,,
2014,5,One of the best most useful travel app. Use 'everywhere' as destination and get the best deal out from where you are.,,,
2014,3,Wish that with connecting fights it was more flexible to select the connection you want. Not as many options as the website,,,
2014,5,"Absolutely brilliant, full stop. Am sure there are rare occasions when you'll find special cheaper offers else where, but I'm yet to and I'm quite an*l about checking.",,,

2014,4,I was using daily tis app. Very easy to find out the chepest airlines... But some more want to improve...,,,
2014,4,I would give it 5 stars if it allowed me to search for multiple destination itineraries. Hands dow  the best flights app!,,,
2014,5,"I use this everytime I book a flight anywhere. Can you take 'Chester, UK' off of the Airport list as no Inbound or Outbound flights go there.",,,
2014,4,"In terms of features its great, but sometimes shows no connection is available even though other apps are able to use internet.",,,
2014,5,"Love it, it's one of the best and I will keep using it for a long time. Thanks",,,
2014,3,Sometimes the information not accurate. You need to recheck. But still helpfull,,,
2014,3,When I was going to buy the system won't let me and I called for assistance they told me that there was a no there one and i try it out and the same thing.,,,

2014,2,"Overall, it's not too bad.  If you fly from a major airport on a major airline, then this is for you.  I've used it twice to book a good deal.  Frontier in December 13, traveling from PHX to IAH; then in February 14 for a March trip via Allegiant from AZA to PSC.  Between then and now, somehow the app no longer allows me to use AZA, or Allegiant as an option for travel.  Like I said, app works well, but it's getting a bad rating, due to the previous capability that is no longer provided & bad customer supp.",,,
2014,4,"There is a lot of space for improvement in terms of smoothness of the app. Also, after initial installation I had to struggle a few times to open it because it kept crashing, after I eventually launched it successfully I did not experience the crash again. The interface is great & very user-friendly. The colours chosen for the general feel of the app is also great!",,,
2014,2,"I used to love skyscanner, but the indicative prices had be now essentially turned into a bait and switch. It can be very useful once you get past this but this feature just adds adds an unnecessary layer of complexity and opacity over the real prices. When this is sorted out I will be happy to return, bit for the time being hunting around the old fashioned way gives better prices.",,,
2014,2,"I love love love Skyscanner and use it first when searching for flights, but this new version of the app is frozen in time on my S5 phone?! I can't get it out of a prior search for flights from NY to London, so it's literally unuseable? Everytime I try to go to menu it just closes the app. It's quite maddening actually.",,,
2016,1,Its a great app. But I dont like the new changes. Not as good as before. It doesn't let you choose the cheapest flights to determine where you want to go. Bring back the older version..I have un installed the new app.,,,
2014,3,"I often fly at last minute and this app really helps find good and some times amazing prices by filling in both dep/des as United States I always click to see the real time prices as the graphs aren't as rapid as real time prices even go to the booking site can show a lower price! Keep in mind many sites are now leaving out taxes/fees etc to make it appear as its the lowest price, which happens even w/Kayak and such! Cleaning your cache is a must to ensure the best pricing as well!",,,
2014,2,"This app is very slow and when you do get a result is only "" indicative"" of the price.  You still have to use a regular computer to get accurate prices.  It needs improvement.  And a filter to remove Ryanair from all results, you get false low prices because of their Bulls**t.",,,
2014,5,"This is the only app i use for booking flights. I've tried several apps, but none of them are as good as this one! I love the option of having two or more flight searches at the same time so I could compair them. Good job!",,,
2014,2,"Booking international one-way for business. Found great fare on BA world traveller class (Premium Economy). When directed to TravelPapa to book, fare and class not available. Disappointing.",,,
2014,5,Best app ever booking flights couldn't be easier. Pick your airports select your dates and search.. cheapest flights with the option of alerts for even cheaper flights then click the book flight option.. I use it all the time,,,

2014,5,"My fab app in finding the best deal. I just feel the need to add the Arabic language option, would be happy to help in translate menus and commands if needed, just drop me an email :-)",,,
2014,2,"The UI+UX is great, but the search is slow and stupid (why search airlines that don't fly the given way?) and the cached prices are way off.",,,
2014,4,"Fantastic app, fast, clean and easy to use. Only thing I would suggest as an improvement would be multi centre flight search facilities. Most my trips are like this forcing me elsewhere",,,
2014,3,The app is good. But you should include an option not only week and month but weekend as well so you can search  for future weekends. It as a week point of the application,,,
2014,5,"Works well. Contrary to other comments, final price for all passengers can be seen by selecting the relevant flight, and unwanted airlines (as well as a host of other variables) can be adjusted via the filters on the search results screen.",,,
2014,3,"Times are wrong for flight duration, prices vary from what's shown on the initial search to when you click through as if you were going to purchase.  This app used to work great but now doesn't.",,,
2014,4,Its an excellent app.. And pretty good to give you the best of options. I liked it. Keep up the good work guys.,,,
2014,5,Exactly what i needed.. i travel by train at no cost.. finding the least expensive flight along the east coast saves $$$$. I take AMTRAK TO THAT CITY.. perfect tool for me.,,,

2014,5,"Virtually the same as the websiye service, except the interface is clear and straightforward. This app makes searching for flights an easy process, and best of all Skyscanner doesn't charge you anything!",,,
2014,4,This app is so easy to use. I love that you can leave the dates open and search for the days that are cheapest. The one negative I have is that when you click on a day the price isn't always what is diplayed.,,,
2014,4,"very useful tool for travellers. Sometimes the prices don't match up, but it's still a great guide and very functional",,,
2014,5,"The updates really changed this application.  Love how you can put in ""anywhere"" as a destination and it will bring up the lowest prices out of your airport to anywhere around the world.",,,
2014,2,"Not accurate at all. Pretty often the best offer implies 2 different companies, which means different airports. May help, but it's unlikely to...",,,
2014,1,Fare quotes are no longer accurate. End up going in circles on numerous unreliable travel sites. This app has lost my vote of confidence.,,,
2014,5,"from far the best one. speed and ergonomik. But once you find your flight I usually book via de company , its cheaper :) sorry for that",,,

2014,4,Useful to find cheap flight. But the price sometimes could be lower if manually go thru all the date for any. Could be improve further,,,
2014,2,The in-app result shows RM848 for 2 but when I proceed to book it shows $848. That's a lot of difference. Don't trust this app,,,
2014,1,I booked my air ticket through sky scanner and due to unavoidable circumstances I had to cancel that but till the date(After almost a year)I didn't get any of the refund even after so many complaints.Very poor management,,,
2014,4,Great app except for when you are directed to a website and prices are suddenly not available anymore or tax is being added. The final price should always be displayed right from the onset.,,,
2014,5,This is one of the best apps in the market . I stopped to use any other browser websites and similar stuff . thank you!,,,
2014,5,Is the only app I use to look for flight s and to start a book. Since when it has its own widget It had everything this app should have,,,

2014,5,Finds a wide variety of flights and gives pretty accurate pricing,,,
2014,5,One place to check all the flight prices and details,,,
2014,4,Allow to choose multiple airports to travel from and to and you'll rock with 5*,,,
2014,4,The web site at which it checks the rate the conversion rate is inappropriate,,,
2014,5,Very functional app. But there are some missing airways for the local flights.,,,
2014,5,I really like it. I would recommend this to anyone.,,,
2014,5,"I've checked many sites and other apps to compare the prices for my flight, and skyscanner  is giving the cheapest options.",,,
2014,2,Prices shown are only indicative... Actually it differs...üëéüëé,,,
2014,5,I like it because of which is necessary for travelling...,,,
2014,5,This fantastic for the person who is adventures and crazy for the flights,,,
2014,1,"Today's upgrade is a catastrophe:  1. For about 2/3 of dates tested, Skycanner returned NO FLIGHTS even for major market city-pairs; 2. System takes 3 TIMES (!) as long to research and return results as previously, even when ""NO FLIGHTS"" is returned; 3. You return flights on only ONE of FIVE carriers providing nonstops in the DEN-CHI market, and only ONE of SIX carriers operating nonstop betwwen DEN and NYC, as examples.  Something went BADLY WRONG with rev.  Suggest you immediately revert to prior rev.",,,
2014,1,"First of all: I opened Skyscanner for the first time, specified destination (LAX) but left 'from' field default (all uk) hit search and what.... from all London airports it only showed Luton! It also showed airports from all over UK but most of them do not have connection with US (Bournemouth was one of them and when you click it, it tells you no result). So what is the point? The other thing is - if you are looking for real (by real I mean price competitive) deals you will not find them here.",,,
2014,2,"When I first installed this app it was great! Sometimes I would find better deals elsewhere but it was good at ballpark estimates. Now? It won't even find me ANY flights! I'm not searching years or even months in advance. I'm looking for October flights, but nothing is coming up. Changed dates. Changed settings. There are ""NO RESULTS"" for me. What happened?? I'm considering deleting this app.",,,
2014,3,"The price search results are dramatically different from the results shown in chart and widget. I love this app and using it for years and I was always satisfied but this annoying issue happened recently which stopping me to find the right flights for me. Please repair it and I will rate you 5 star again, thanks !",,,
2014,1,Tried to book 6 tickets. Total price came back $1000 more than the individual price quoted times 6. Selected the next higher priced  individual ticket and the total came back LESS than the first total. Selected an even higher priced ticket and the total was even lower. I am deleting this app. Do not give them your credit card number!,,,
2014,4,I would like to see some logic built in that allows some other intelligence to account for transit times between close airports. For example if my closest airport is 30 minutes but there is an alternative 90 minutes away I'd like an advance search option which would show alternatives on the same search but from different departure airports. If a flight from my nearest airport has a connection which would result in total travel time being longer I would prefer an alternative from the next nearest airport.,,,
2014,3,The main problem is the pricing. It tells you that this is the cheapest price and the final figure is more than first quoted. I had to go through all the prices just to find the lowest. The airline which appears to have the lowest fair might be more expensive than the ones that appear to have higher fairs. So be prepared to to go through the results one by one and get the final price and you might get a surprise.,,,
2014,5,"The app is amazing and has helped me book tons of flights at good prices, however it would be very helpful if the team could add a feature for state and continent searching as opposed to just countries. It would be amazing to be able to say I want to fly out of all of Europe instead of comparing each country when my itinerary is very flexible. Similarly, it is missing states/provinces in some countries that would be really useful to have. The best thing about this app is how flexible it is, but that could s",,,
2014,2,"I've been trying to book my flights for two hours but thanks to this application I haven't succeeded yet and I don't know how much more hassle I can take. Whenever I try to access the agency site, the website gives an error message reading due to web construction your application cannot be submitted which I strongly believe that its all about bloody marketing! Let me get my bloody tickets will you!",,,
2014,5,"Really couldn't ask for more. Literally. It gives you hundreds of flight options for standard routes. I haven't tried obscure routes yet, but even the shortest route I looked into had dozens of options. I would absolutely recommend this app.",,,
2014,5,"Hi skyscanner team, I love this apps and I have noticed now you added premium economy, business and first class option. However, could you work on putting the option for multicity trip search also? That would help a lot!!!",,,
2014,5,Quickly checks multiple sites for flights and finds the best deals. Custom filters makes choosing the best route for you easy. We use all the time. Occasionally flight prices can vary dramatically over a couple of days but i assume this is the airlines changing prices.,,,
2014,4,"The app works quite well although some functions can be improved. Its different to web version and lacks the daily pricing and multiple destinations.all in all , a good app to get your initial prices in place",,,
2014,3,I was unable to find good pricing. A simple Google search gave me cheaper options. I do like the bar chart but without real information always it is not that useful for me.,,,
2014,2,"Cannot login or create account. Will give more stars once I can login. Feedback sent to SkyScanner, awaiting their response (25/06/2014). (17/07/2014) - Still no response from company regarding this bug after contacting them on the website they posted.",,,
2014,1,"I tried to re-install the aplication, but it was still same. When i click ""search"", ""No Results"" always shown up. Please fix. Thank you",,,
2014,1,Can't book a one way flight.  None of the prices that first appear come through in the total price.    In answer to your question my main gripe with your app is I cannot book a one way flight or even get a quote for one.  I only travel on one way flights,,,
2014,3,"The idea of this app is absolutely brillient. How ever, I think the a flight that would take less than hour listed as 12hr flight time or more is taking the mickey. Unless the app pulls its socks up I will be deleting soon.",,,
2014,4,"It finds so many flight agencies . Few low cost proposals. To much adds that distract from searching. Find only high costly flights. However, it is advisable apps to have for travel booking.",,,
2014,5,Easy to navigate and search between dates. I love the chart you can view price fluctuations across the week all on one screen. I think would be great to have the ability to view multi stop flights though...that gets me a little!,,,
2014,3,"This is a good app. Although,  I've found cheaper fares elsewhere. It easy to use and the filter system works a charm.",,,
2014,5,"Only thing that could be improved upon is if you add hotel search to app. Thank you for decreasing size of app, more people need to do this!",,,
2014,5,Better than any other search engine. More airlines searched than all the major players. Valuable to our tour company and its clients.,,,
2014,1,How do you change your flight destination? Definately not user friendly. Gave up and uninstalled.,,,
2014,3,"Don't use if you're going to a smaller regional airport. What little number of direct flights they do have will be very lengthy flights, to the tune of 16 hours one way from Phoenix to Bellingham, WA",,,
2014,4,"I used to plan my holiday with friends during our gathering. With this app, I can check and get the price immediately. Even book the tix. Love it.",,,
2014,5,Overall good UI. Comparison of flight prices & other options presented well. Must-have for frequent flyers.,,,
2014,5,This searches all airlines and shows it without pop ups.  You can scroll to see what dates have lowest fares instead of trying date after date.  Love it.,,,
2014,5,"This gives you every combination of flights you can think of,  all in one place.  Easy to compare pricing with different flight times. Love it!",,,
2014,5,A friend of mine shared this app with me. I absolutely love it! Now I don't have to use the other websites that take for ever to load. This one is quick.,,,
2014,3,It's used to work well then after one particular search it wouldn't let me go back. The app would exit every time I tried.,,,
2014,1,The pricing layout chart is stupid.  I dont understand a chart that shows a number to the left of the chart and another number down the line and nothing day by day.....,,,
2014,4,I like it it allow you to have an idea of what are the cost will be in specific period of the year. Some times the price are not accurate after you pick your  traveling dates.,,,
2014,5,I constantly tell people about this app! Its saved me money out the wahzoo! I moved far away from my home state and have been able to fly because of this app! Please never go away sky scanner!!,,,
2014,2,"As long as i love this app and use it a lot, but Why is not accurate? ?? Why u put a price while it is not??? After I bought my ticket by 260 $ I find that it charged me 404 $ , unbelievable !!!!",,,
2014,5,It would be great if the widget had an option of how many days I want my trip to be. This word filter the results better.,,,
2014,2,"Selecting ‚Ç¨71 flight there and ‚Ç¨71 return makes it ‚Ç¨141, but clicking next shows me cheapest ticket for ‚Ç¨266. This is really bad UX.",,,
2014,5,"Great app. You can search any combination, change dates and airports easily and all very quickly and intuitively. Nice!",,,
2014,1,Tried flight from Seattle to San Francisco. It said it doesn't serve one of the airports.  Tried Seattle to an international city with same results.  HTC One M8,,,

2014,5,Features that no one else has: keep open more search at the same time; receive daily updates about prices,,,
2014,5,"I've tried all the others.  This one finds the best flights, with the most useful parameters (especially departure and arrival-time filtering!)...  The website is slightly better than the app, but... It's a keeper for me, planning trips while in bed! LOL!",,,
2014,4,This is one of the best flight pricing apps and services but I'm disappointed the app won't move to external SD card memory making it a very resource hungry app.,,,

It wuld b gr8 app if we can sort list of arrivals n depatures timing of next 24 hrs of any airport in d world. Its not a big deal for dev to include this option to make it complete app.,,,
2014,4,"I think the ultimate mobile UI for flight booking hasn't yet been found. This is pretty good, but needs multi leg trips. Also wondering if there's a better comparison page possibility for an ""at a glance"" . Best one on Android though so many thanks!",,,
2014,4,"Only thing that really should be in the app that isn't is the ability for Multi-City bookings. e.g Toronto to Ottawa to Montreal. At present the app only supports one way or return to the originating airport , annoying if you want to book flights to a few places. Air Canada has a good Multi-City booking option, something like that in Skyscanner would make it very awesome indeed :)",,,
2014,4,"Update 1 May: I'm happy to improve my rating from one to four stars now that the developers have corrected a catastrophic flaw. I'm also  impressed with their tech support (Hi, Niel!) once I got their attention. I might even go to five stars once I've had time to explore the app more thoroughly.",,,
2014,5,"App updated and works fine! Thanks for the work and the feedback Devs.  >>> Hi, as requested I went to your contact form but it only had basic fields so I thought I might aswell provide the details of how the app is not working here.  I have a Google Nexus 5, fully updated.  When I open the app, I get the dialogue box:  Not enough space  Insufficient External and Internal memory. Please free at least 30MB and reinstall the app.  Internal memory free: 18,424MB External memory free: 18,424MB  Needless to say, I have sufficient memory. Surprisingly, uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem.  Hope you fix it soon.  Thanks",,,
2014,5,"Awesome! I have found some terrific deals. My daughter, son-in-love, two awesome grandchildren as well as my youngest son live in Kansas and I in Colorado. I try to visit as often as possible and this app has been a great help. I just wish I could find a reasonably priced way to bring my dog along as she is a great help with some of my disabilities. Thanks again!",,,
2016,2,"I use to absolutely love this app, only one I used to book flights. However, recent update has made it nearly impossible to use because it won't allow me to select exact dates I need flights. Disappointed",,,
2014,3,There is no app icon showing up after download. Program is unintuitive - what is the order of operations? Where can I find my searches. Perhaps some kind of training video would help. Still would rather launch from an icon rather than widget.,,,
2014,1,Can't find the flights at the right price. Wth  Update- having the same issue agai. Shows theres a $98 flight I click it and shows me $195,,,
2014,2,Doesn't always reflect +days correctly.   Example: IAD-PEK on emirates airline indicates +2 but it is actually only +1.   Couldn't find option for multiple destinations.,,,
2014,4,In general the app works very well with all the same filter features as the website. The only problem is when there is a new version the app says I need to get the update but then it won't download and upgrade to the new version,,,
2014,1,"Days 8mb but true bulky size is over 14mb. Doesn't help that it's slow and pretends it's ""scanning"", quit the silly fake animation and do it properly. Clumsy design is disappointing from a large profitable company.",,,
2014,1,Prices totally wrong... just checked a flight one way from dublin to Birmingham only ‚Ç¨9 does not exist. Yesterday showing one way flight to barcelona from dublin for ‚Ç¨2... surprise surprise non existant,,,
2014,4,"I enjoy using this application for finding flights I just wish it were a little more user friendly. If there were some way to save flight information as you continue looking for other flights to compare, that would be great.",,,
2014,5,"Update: Finally ART support so bumped back to 5 stars.  Great app when it used to work but it's been 5 months since Kit Kat was released and still no ART support, every single other app I've tried has worked flawlessly with ART so not sure what the problem is here",,,
2014,5,"ART support! Thanks so much devs, you guys are legends. There is no true replacement for your brilliant and beautiful app. Perfect. Thank you.",,,
2014,5,"Thanks to the developer for fixing the issue! Was able to use the app, although couldn't find good prices right now... Sucks traveling nowadays haha! But overall is a very simple to use app. :)",,,
2014,1,"All quotes appear to be without, fees, charges and taxes. In reality the flights are much, much more expensive. In Australia it is illegal to advertise without these fees included in the price. Not sure how these guys are avoiding that law.",,,
2014,5,Easy to use. I like the map and month features when searching for flights and prices. It also saves your searches. Has a lot of airlines to choose from not often seen in other websites.,,,
2014,4,"Great for booking or even just checking flight prices... Usually pretty speedy, even with poor internet connection. Saved me a lot of cash a few times!",,,
2014,1,Cheap prices are fake. Especially for direct flights. Once you tap to the cheapest price and redirected to one of the cites - the message is 'sorry this price is not available anymore',,,
2014,2,"There's no app icon, only a widget, which takes lots of screen space. So the only way to start it is to go to Settings- Apps. Odd. Makes you wonder what else is missing.",,,
2014,1,Tried to book flights to Greece and none of the prices provided actually worked out.  7 attempts and all failed quoting price changes.  Other than finding out flight times this app is useless!,,,
2014,5,I know this app from my last bb device. Now on Android is much more better. Very useful for those who travel often. My advice is to take it.,,,
2014,5,Is the best ap...I'm always putting in dates to destinations. .very addictive ..Off we go on yet ANOTHER holiday.. Thanks Sky scanner,,,
2014,4,"I love this app, but now that I upgraded from the GS3 to GS5, I have no widget for this app. No bueno! I love the widget. Please, fix this?! You will then have my 5 stars.",,,
2014,5,"Sometimes, you have a few days free and don't have a destination in mind. This is the first flight search I have found that caters for impulsive souls like mine! To do even better, I have 4 airports within fairly easy reach, so searching on flights within a radius of my home would make random getaway searches even easier.",,,
2014,5,Best app for seeing best days to fly when dates are flexible.  I fly monthly so this is a necessity to me.  Thank you to those who developed this!,,,
2014,4,The app is usefull but have a lack of features. This app should add a alarm to advise customers when their flight becomes cheaper or expensive...,,,
2017,1,"Used to be a great app but now just a massive let down. They don't display cheapest fares, too many inaccuracies and I will no longer use.",,,
2014,5,"Love this app. I get a fair bit of time off. When I do I just select the date and location of departure it gives your every daparture coming up  and connecting flights, and travel time. Good for random cheap spur off the moment trip's.",,,
2014,5,"Ive been usuing sky scanner for a few years now. Its the only place i get my tickets from, and im a regular flyer. Awesome website and even better app :)",,,
2014,5,"Excellent app. Sometimes you have to go to the individual webpages to check it hasn't missed a hidden deal, but it gives you an excellent idea",,,
2014,3,Needs to have Canadian pricing and do a better job of validation.  Some of the ticketing agencies are fraudulent or very untrustworthy or both. Otherwise a wonderful app.,,,
2014,5,Nothing compares to this app. And the best part? It is absolutely free. Thank you very much!,,,
2014,5,"Great deals on flights,very good.One very important missing item is that,it wasn't programed for muti-city travels. That sucks.",,,
2014,4,"I find this app really useful, I have now booked a flight 3 times through it. Because I fly to Africa it's handy to use for all the various airlines and it keeps your searches.",,,
2014,5,Issue addressed and works like a charm on the nexus 5!  Thanks to the developers! Good job!,,,
2014,5,"It's working again.  Phew!   I got lost in Newark looking for Omaha in New York.  So it is in Nebraska,  thanks to this App. Jets are back in flight!",,,
2014,4,"Some joker/¬øcoder? has renamed this app as Flights thus making it more difficult to find (when installed). So, minus a *!",,,
2014,4,Very useful... Great detailing... Cheapest way to book tickets.. n lot many options to choose from...,,,
2014,5,"Definitely a must for any travel planning, great features and practicality, saves you time in finding the best deals on airlines.",,,
2014,4,"Only used it to check out flight prices, times etc which is quite straightforward, haven't booked anything through it yet, that's why I only gave it 4 stars.",,,
2014,4,It has this unique feature of saving previously searched results in form of tabs. And prices are quite similar to other apps.,,,
2014,5,I live thebapp. I'm just confused as to why it will quote one price for airfare by when u search or select that price u don't get it ! Still more helpful than other apps.,,,
2014,5,"Simply the best, though I have to say I mainly use Skyscanner to get a broad overview over connections, prices, and times, rather than as a booking portal. Fantastic app!",,,
2014,4,Hope that next update will feature or give notification for discounted/promo fares.:),,,
2014,5,"Fantastic app, real time saver! The best way to search for flights. Would give 6 stars if possible.",,,
2014,5,"Very user friendly. Doesn't leave you guessing, it really is a useful app to have.",,,
2014,5,"On both my Nexus 5 and Nexu 7. When I open the app it's says, ""insufficient external memory"", and when I tell it to use internal memory the app doesn't find any airports. Edit: It may be because I'm on ART(?)",,,
2014,4,But missing application based price alerting. With email notifications it's just not as handy,,,
2014,5,Very user friendly..efficient too. Very happy with it..Best assistant for flight search and bookings.,,,
2014,5,"I just think it's one of the best application, designed simple. I didn't buy any tickets yet but the idea of presentation is great.",,,
2014,5,Best flight search experience I've ever had... most often cheaper than all other travel websites... you will be pleased...,,,
2014,1,I looked up a flight found the cheapest one and went to book it just to find out that it wasn't even available at that price. No where near it.,,,
2014,2,"Why am I seeing ‚ÄúNew York Newark‚Äù as my departure?  Double check your search people, you don't want to end up in Afghanistan instead of Florida.",,,
2014,5,"Great overview of flights even to ""everywhere"" as destination. And very user-friendly.",,,
2014,5,I've been looking all over for an app that would search my local airport and tell me all the options of the places I could fly. this is it,,,
2014,4,Great for major routes and big carriers. Unfortunately doesn't work well for smaller routes. Still awesome though...,,,
2014,5,"Finally, support for ART! Now it works flawlessly on my nexus 5.",,,
2014,2,Redirected to another site but you have to enter your information and search for the flight all over again. Prices don't match the site it redirects you to.,,,
2014,4,U gonna need this app. Install it asap On ur mobile. Very helpful.,,,
2014,5,This app is terrific and relied on. I've traveled overseas and purchased tickets via this apps couple of time. This app is really helpful and useful.,,,
2014,5,The most straight forward format. Works fast & accurate...,,,
2014,5,Tried em all. Always end up using Skyscanner. Gets me best process. Allows me to find shortest itineraries.,,,
2014,4,"It's at least a place to checj on flight costs. You save , more when you buy air tickets during the week, and 1 to 3 eeeks before you leave.",,,
2014,5,Have grabbed some great bargains with this app so far. No issues. Love it.,,,
2014,5,"Booked my flight from USA to Chile for almost a thousand dollars less than I found anywhere else, on a very comfortable and accommodating airline, too!",,,
2014,5,I found great airfare to go to Paris in Summer 2013 And now to Disney 2014. Great app. Highly reccommended!!,,,

2014,5,I use this app all the time. Accurate and helpful. I fly every 6 weeks and one of the most important apps I have,,,
2014,1,"Yay, scam. Also, the prices end up being higher or there are no available tickets.",,,
2014,4,"Can't share search results. Also price was only for one way.  (not the overall departure and return,  which doubled the final price).",,,
2014,5,Great app. Easy to use. Quickest way to find tickets!,,,
2014,5,Good app!!! Found many a cheap flight for me and the family. Would highly recommend this app.,,,

2014,5,You don't have to even put in date or destination and can scroll through countries and prices -very addictive if you like booking holidays,,,
2014,5,I downloaded the so and found very useful deals. Very impressed by the app.,,,
2014,2,It doesn't show the lowest fares. It's better to go to sites like Expedia or airline companies.,,,
2014,5,"After the last update the app finally works great on art, awesome!",,,
2014,2,"I see you now use Air fast tickets, I did a Google search and they had poor reviews from many people",,,

2014,5,This app has saved me thousands on cheap flights despite not being a regular traveller. Keep up the good work!,,,
2014,3,I filtered out Spirit Airlines but it still allowed them for one leg of the trip with no option to extend it to both.,,,
2014,4,"Skyscanner is really helpfull and useful. Good app, never presented any trouble while using it.",,,
2014,5,"Works fast, multiple airlines, excellent filtering options!",,,
2014,4,Prices reflect exactly what the airline website shows!! . Love it always on point,,,
2014,4,"Very good app, very good flight searcher. It could add multiple destinations though.",,,
2014,4,Easy to use and prices are very up to date. Keep up the good work....,,,
2014,5,Love this app. It's super flexible and let's you compare not just abroad airlines but airports and times of travel as well.,,,
2014,4,"Havent used it yet, have checked for flights and prices. Very easy to use app",,,
2014,3,Better if you also refer not only biggest airline but also small airlines,,,
2014,5,Not likely to find a better price comparison website or app for flights. Also this app is the best way to figure out what airlines operate what routes and for the best price.,,,
2014,4,Nice app. So helpful to find the best and cheap airline,,,
2014,3,Southwest airlines isn't pulling any more.  It was working a last week.,,,
2014,4,Very good app. Could allow the choice of multiple departure points to get to one city though.,,,
2014,3,Nice interface but KAYAK found cheaper flights from BDL to Dallas TX.,,,
2014,5,"This is really a great apps! However, It'd be better if other services like trains and hotels are included in this apps as well .",,,
2014,5,Extremely fast & accurate! It's like having your own travel Agent.,,,
2014,4,Will be perfect if there is a Multiple destinations option instead of Single and Return flights only.,,,
2014,4,Often got a very good deal on sky scanner and it's soo easy to use.,,,

2014,5,"Quick and easy to use,I use it to scout all my flight requests!Still using it 2 yrs later and still doing the job!",,,
2014,5,I use this app every time I fly. Just be sure to clear the history for better rates.,,,
2014,5,I have used the website for years to book intereuropean flights. Love the app!,,,
2014,1,Surprised to see a review by me before considering I've never reviewed this app! Wtf?,,,

2014,5,Excellent helps to find the cheapest flight in a range of day's great for someone that doesn't has to fly on a set date,,,
2014,1,Loading for search results takes forever even with strong wifi,,,

2014,5,"I love it, fast & reliable!! Keep it up and looking foward to more trips using this app:-)",,,
2014,5,Easy enuf to use. Better than ringing the airline....,,,

2016,5,I like how it gives me options!!! All the options!!!,,,
2014,5,A Travel Ticket App gotta be like this one........ Or.. Only this One!,,,
2014,4,Taxes aren't included and fares differ than results,,,
2014,5,It helps me to choose cheapest flight for my vacation,,,
2014,1,"Completely false, i wasted 20 minutes finding a flight only to be directed to 3rd party website that didn't match anything in price or times listed. First of all, if I wanted to deal with web browsing on the phone ill just go to other sites in the first place - who needs an app to do that? 2nd of all, your app is responsible for the prices you show reguardless of who's error (or baited intention) that was.",,,
2014,1,"Getting error of not enough space in my Nexus 4. Also when trying to enter destination and departure airports, nothing shows up. Basically useless. Was using the older version. Thought updating will correct the problem but that didn't happen. Uninstall is just a click away if I do not see an update soon.",,,
2014,1,"After last update whenever I go into the app, it states I must change where data is stored to my external memory, I only have internal memory (nexus 5) so once I click OK app crashes sometimes, or when it does not crash, it won't allow me to select any outgoing airports (nothing shows in list). Told by support this is due to new runtime available on android 4.4 - told its not released as standard so not supported. So 1 star because app no longer works, but when it does work, its great, pity...",,,
2014,4,"Its a really good app and makes searching for flights so much easier. I would have given 5 stars but for the fact that the search does not tell you if the flight has checked in luggage included or not so you don't have to spend time going into a site and then coming back out because the price doesnt include hold luggage. So developers take note. Maybe a little suitcase logo with weight allowance in brackets saying 0kg, 20kg, 23kg, etc would help. Otherwise a very good app",,,
2017,1,"The old car hire app was 100x better. The filters don't work as well on this one, and I really don't need to define my car hire start time to the nearest 5 minutes. Really disappointed that the old app's been taken away and won't be using this one in it's place - the Expedia app is far better and usually gets close to the cheapest price.",,,
2014,5,"As a digital nomad, I'm obsessed with this app! It seems to be the best flight search tool out there. It's simple to search flights to ""any"" destination (whoa) and easy to chart alternate dates to get a better price -- great for those of us who are flexible and searching for the best deal. Love using the tabs to perform multiple searches, too! Solid app with a clean interface. Thank you, Skyscanner!",,,
2014,3,"What i don't like abt this app is it doesn't have an easy payment settle function. I tried a few times to pay on phone and it always led to different websites and ended up errors or requiring more apps before payment. If it had an easier way to check out like amazon, i would use it a lot more often than i do now.",,,
2016,1,This app used to be the standard 'go to' app for me and my friends when searching for good flights and narrowing down the search to get the best deals for you. Now the app has been updated and made redundant! The app has sacrificed aesthetic merit over practicality. Such a shame!,,,
2014,3,"In general Sky scanner is a very useful and easy to use tool. However, lately I've not been getting any Ryanair results on the app (website is fine). Thing is, my route home is only serviced by Ryanair. This makes things quite awkward!",,,
2014,4,"used it to gauge dates and prices for a large asia holiday. could do with more airlines included. also a good feature would be "" cheapest flight from here"" for spontaneous travellers. as of april 2014 the app has been broken and not working at all.",,,
2014,4,"P: Thoroughly enjoy this app. Can count on it to provide the cheapest flight options.  C: You can get caught paying extra to secure seats after payment. ""Pls pay x amount to forward your flight request to the airline. Otherwise you will remain on the 'waiting list'""",,,
2014,1,"I downloaded the App and tried to check prices for two different flights as follows:  Jakarta - Melbourne return (depart 9 March return 7 September) and Melbourne - Singapore return (depart 9 March return 31 March)  On both searches it returned 0 flights. Whole that's a joke in it's own right, to add insult to injuries it displayed an add of another travel website which was boasting $290 flights to Singapore not mentiong any specific dates....   So I shall do this App the favour it deserves UNINSTALL :-|",,,
2014,3,"I love this app! It really gives me the cheapest flight. However, it was working fine until right now, i cant open the app, when i do, they said i have insufficient memory and i have to free at least 30mb to use the app. My storage space has got 29gb, how can i not have extra space? Please fix this issue, i cant use the app anymorr. Even after reinstalling it.",,,
2014,1,Running a nexus 4 on android 4.4. When launching the app it gives an insufficient memory error and won't allow you to search for airports. What a shame. I used to exclusively use skyscanner but have switched to Kayak... Which works.,,,
2014,5,"Great engine for flight search, easy to use. The search using calendar should be improved and consider filter options. Additional option for best price in range of +/- 3 days would be also great (giving only flights which match the filter options)",,,
2014,1,"I'd give 0 stars if possible.  Sky scanner offered a great price on a flight, then dumped me on one travel where the price mysteriously went up. Repeated to verify. The final price was no worse than other apps, but the feeling of being conned certainly was.",,,
2014,1,"Don't bother.  What's the point of a price finding ticket app if it doesn't even give you an accurate price on your search? I'm not talking about a couple dollars either.  I was quoted $144 roundtrip on the departure and return screen, then went to the pick your flight screen and it's now $249!! Giant waste of time.",,,
2014,1,"There is no indication of what the price will be until I select my dates, making the app relatively pointless. If I wanted to put in 50 different start and return dates to see which was cheaper, I would do so elsewhere. The app acts like it's going to load the preview, but never does, instead only showing dates on an otherwise blank screen.",,,
2014,1,"Can't access my favorite app without downloading this and I don't even want this on my phone. Same goes for all my friends who can't get into the same app that I can't get into and we get taken straight to this page. Fix this please, because we aren't downloading this.",,,
2014,1,"Very poor! Missing airlines, websites,  doesn't search all the connection and economy one. Only expensive options. I really liked it more before. Right now, very dissapointed.",,,
2014,5,"Better than any other app or site I've used.  As far as it not running on ART - that is a DEVELOPER mode, they're not obligated to be compatible at the moment and you shouldn't give a low rating because you're using a beta feature in Android. That being said it will be a bonus when they implement that. :)",,,
2014,5,"Great app! Its search trickles through the popular to the smallest travel websites finding THE BEST deals on tickets, that are not only cheap, but also convenient arrangements. Super useful when planning out your next trip.",,,
2014,1,"Absolute horrible experience, prices are fake, 3 different websites were giving a price and then when you were about to pay they would increase it. We ended up going directly to the Finnish airlines website, cheaper and no headache...  Be very careful!",,,
2014,1,"I search for flights and get no  results (only 2 stops & very expensive). When I search through the chart I can see cheaper options, but once selected it won't progress, goes back to weird results list.",,,
2014,1,"Consistently says ""we are experiencing a temporary problem. Please try again.""   Shame - there are only so many times I'll try again before I go looking for an alternative that works...",,,
2014,4,"After upgrade to Android 4.4 the app stop working I keep getting error Insufficient External and Internal memory Nexus 4 doesn't have external memory, and I have over 6G of free space in internal memory, but program keep ask me to free another 30MB.  Someone need to fix it",,,
2014,2,"Application itself is really nice. Has lots of useful features, nice widgets and looks good as well. But... it shows wrong prices which makes it useless.",,,
2014,2,"Does not hold filter settings for same journey.  Journey detail does not include aircraft type. Calendar chart date header fonts far too small for 7"" tablet. Kayak better.",,,
2014,4,"I use it all the time for work travel and for picking last minute destinations. Occasionally when you click the link to book, the price jumps up a bit. But, considering how many search engines it's scanning at once..... Its my most used app, I love it!",,,
2014,3,"This app itself is great, but do check the prices against the itself! Saved $300 that way one the ""fees and taxes"" we're factored in to the 3rd party lowest quoted price thru app. Otherwise functions well and does what it's supposed to do.",,,
2014,1,Comes up with memory warning saying that I've not got sufficient external memory to run the app (15GB! free). Then when in the app the screen flickers on every key press! Uninstalled immediately.,,,
2014,1,Complains not enough free space despite over 20GB free. No option but to quit. I am NOT using ART as some previous developer responses have indicated.,,,
2014,5,"Works well and fast, easy to use, all the info you need! Perfect to find the cheapest flights! Only downside: does not allow for multiple destinations, only round trips",,,
2014,5,An excellent way to get good flights for most times the best prices.. I've booked countless flights from Skyscanner and I'm always satisfied. Thanks for a GREAT app,,,
2014,1,I keep receiving a message that I have not got an internet connection and can't receive flight info. How come that I am able to contact you and use other apps.  No problems before upgrade. Please fix and I will review.,,,
2014,4,"This app would have deserved a five-star rating if only prices weren't so inaccurate. You are attracted by low, eye-catching prices which hold very little truth in many cases. Apart from this, the app is useful.",,,
2014,2,Where have all the Ryanair flights gone? For many people this airline is the only option for traveling.  Please add. On the website everything is showing normally.,,,
2014,3,"The price was the same price that I found on kayak, which is the lowest. But the calendar graph didn't work so I can't tell if other dates would be cheaper.",,,
2014,4,Great to look for cheap airfare.  Do look into airline on details some prices do not include bags or carry ons.  Would rate 5 but haven't booked a flight yet.,,,
2014,5,"Gives you a wide array of flight options and airlines to choose from and your search options are easily customizable. Clean, sleak, and organizable. A definite shortcut on your front page.",,,
2014,5,I love the fact that I get the option to see rates available in more than just 3 days of travel date and it also shows the cheapest amount for the entire month or two...This is what separates this app from others. This what awesome is.,,,
2014,4,Works great!  Very helpful have not had problems with it so far :-) Can't wait to see if everything goes well after purchase of a ticket...,,,
2014,3,"Seems like a cool app, but search options are very limited. Most importantly, in my opinion, multi-city and one wat flights aren't included.",,,
2014,5,"This app is awesome, I use it all the time, but right now, running KitKat on my Nexus 4 using the new ART runtime it won't work.   It worked fine with the old Dalvik runtime.   It keeps complaining about insufficient memory, with well over 1gb free, I'm not sure why.   Hopefully this will be a relatively quick fix for you guys, and I can go back to using this awesome app.",,,
2014,1,"Doesn't work on my Nexus 4, it says there is insufficient internal and external memory available, and that I should free 30Mb, and then goes on to tell me I have  1470Mb free on both (there is no external memory on the Nexus 4). The only time it opened, I couldn't search for any departure city.",,,
2014,5,This is a great app. I love to use this app. I think it would be greater if you can add a remunder menu. Which can tell at us if the price has drope or rise. Thanks,,,
2014,5,I use this all the time and have never encountered a problem.  The flights I have found on Skyscanner have been cheaper than quotes out there on other sites/apps.  Thanks,,,
2014,1,Deals not as it seems. You click to buy tickets and you transferred to different websites where the prices are much higher. Useless & waist of time and space.,,,
2014,4,"Love the interface and ability to check flexible dates, where it shows you the lowest price possible. Just wish there was a way to do a multi city trip!",,,
2014,1,Prices aren't consistent fron the initial prices shown to the next screen.  Useless. Manipulative system draws you in with unavailable cheap prices.   Then tries to get you to call a premium number from your mobile.  Fail,,,
2014,5,"Recently used this app to compare flight tickets. Love the flexibility of being able to filter based on dates, destinations, number of stopovers, time of the flight, etc, which makes this app a fabulous travel planning tool!",,,
2014,5,"I downloaded this skyscanner app about 2 weeks ago, and love it. I all ready reservations for my liitle sister ,that I have not seen in 15 yrs, to fly up from california to Alaska. I also using this app, I made reservations to fly down to california for our first ever family vacation this summer of 2014.",,,
2014,5,Easy to use. Bold. No lag. Hardly complicated. Find flights cheaper than own airline site. Easy for any android user,,,
2014,1,"I will never use this app again! Charged more then was stated. Customer Service is awful and not helpful, cannot understand English.",,,
2014,3,But the dates you can return are different depending on the days you fly out. Also some routes have no flights for weeks.. Strange,,,
2014,2,"To be PERFECT could be included more Airlines. But the biggest problem is the bug when you find a flight that cost ""X"" and when you click on it, the price that shows is different.",,,
2014,3,"When you select a date based on price and proceed to the next page to select the flight, often there are no flights of that price, which renders the previous stage pointless. In my most recent search, the cheapest flight was 33% more expensive than what it said was the ""indicative"" cheapest price for that day.",,,
2014,1,"From Atlanta to Iraq I found it for 850$ on CheapOair. However, at this app I found the same flight for 1,300$!  It just doesn't make sense.  P. S, I double checked on the web.",,,
2014,1,App won't even open even after a factory reset of phone with no running apps.   Also tried on a Note 3 and same thing.,,,
2014,5,"It works, the layout is simple, and the chart feature is great for someone without fixed dates. I never write reviews, but felt compelled this time.",,,
2014,3,"Doesn't work on vanilla android on HTC one with ART enabled, although if going back to dalvik it works well.",,,
2014,1,I have galaxy S4. After installation of this app it tells me I don't have enough memory space. But I do have 6G available.....,,,
2014,1,"It says i dont have enough internal memory, but in fact i have more than enough. My phone is n4 and running ART mode.",,,
2014,5,Very good user interface. Provide every possible filter option. Able to screen only required information.,,,
2014,3,Good app but its not working anymore after the update :( i tap to open it a blank black page opens then i receive an error saying the app stopped working but even the error message crashes and closes by itself in a second - so i cant even report it -.- please fix!!,,,
2014,3,"Pernah check harga, tapi.. tidak sesuai dengan / pada waktu pembelian ticket.. Mohon untuk disempurnakan update harganya..",,,
2014,3,Havent used it yet but I typed in a location from Manchester to Rome for just 2 days and it came to alittle over 800 pound for 2 people that doesn't seem cheap to me thats expensive!! :/,,,
2014,5,"Thanks for fixing the APP for kitkat. Skyscanner now works perfect, to find the cheapest ticket for my travel !  I have reset the stars to 5 ! Deserve it.",,,
2014,4,App is so far so good.. User friendly :) if it's showing extremely cheaper rates ll be more happy..lol,,,
2014,5,If your a global lover this app will give you the flexibility and info that you need from any point on the globe. No fuss & delivers the deals!!,,,
2014,5,I especially like the Everywhere feature. Long weekend? Why not see where the cheapest flight will take you!,,,
2014,4,It's good but t   here is some of the country currency not showing like Bahrain (United Kingdom of bahrain). I think you can fix the problem.,,,
2014,5,My best airline selector. Almost perfect. There are some issues that your shown prices and internal prices vary but with  minor variations. Keep up your good spirits.,,,
2014,5,"This application can direct us to almost all airlines at our destination. Hence we can sort based on whichever flight we want! Based on price, etd, eta, airlines.. Especially it can direct to the best multiple flight choices! R Really recommended!",,,
2014,5,This is so far best search engine I ever used before. It always gives you the best airfare options.   Martin,,,
2014,2,I use this app all the time but   just recently it keeps closing itself every time I open it. Says they are working on the problem but nothing has been fixed.,,,
2014,5,Un app incredibilmente buona e utile. Perfetta nella ricerca di voli e il top √® che il prezzo mostrato √® quello effettivo. Nessuna sovrapprezzo,,,
2014,4,I wish to have next day option on one way only flight not only when I select return date. Otherwise 5 stars.,,,
2014,5,"Just an all round informative,  easy to use app, completely takes the work out of flight shopping! Thanks",,,
2014,1,"Country screen says '82$ tickets are available for Norway', but when you enter to the country to find that deal the prices shown start from 200$. Uninstalled immediately",,,
2014,5,"compared with other web sites. Love it! Thank you guys, great job! :-)",,,
2014,1,"I would rate this a 5 but as of right now, app does not run on Android 4.4.2 Nexus 5 running ART. It complains that there is  insufficient internal and external memory when there is plentiful available memory and the Nexus 5 doesn't have external memory.",,,
2014,2,"Specific flight searches are ok, but the search by month tracker and the widget are way off the actual prices. It's a standard flight search engine.",,,
2014,1,App doesn't work. How do I give no stars! Update has things the app,,,
2014,1,Keeps not showing full listing of airports I can fly to plus the price this update is not cool old version a 5 star this version 1 star,,,
2014,1,App works fine but the prices are random and never in your favour e.g skyscanner price ¬£440 but when you book it's ¬£700 bit of a waste of time,,,
2014,5,You can open multiple windows and save searches. There are numerous ways to sort and filter. I sometimes prefer this app to the computer since this is so customizable.,,,
2014,5,"Getting uptodate alerts are easy, I will certainly recom     mend the site to friends and family.    Thanks skyscanner.",,,
2014,4,This is by far the most convenient app to keep track of air fare. Use it very often. Save money as well Good design,,,
2014,5,I've used it to book my last two vacations - it's easy to use and quick to scan for airfare costs. I've compared prices with other apps and Skyscanner is always up to date and accurate. This app does what it's supposed to do~‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ!!,,,
2014,3,"have an ability to choose combinated flights with different locations as To and From. I mean we are planning a trip from Paris to Amsterdam on bikes, and so we need different places as Depart and Return...",,,
2014,5,Excellent tool and even better than the Skyscanner website. I always use skyscanner which consistently gets me the best deals.,,,
2014,1,Prices quoted on this app are really expensive compared to doing a normal web search and going to a travel agent. Try $1000 more expensive :/,,,
2014,5,"After an exhausting search online, this VERY easy app was not only a piece of cake to figure it out, but I saved over $200 dollars on airfare. Great job gang!",,,
2014,1,Won't load. Some bullshit about internal memory. Worked fine a few months ago. Now its hot garbage.,,,
2014,5,It is a very good app to book a flight with cheaper prices.  I booked my flight ticket. Thanks,,,
2014,1,This is the error message I get whenever I try to run a search. I'm running android on a Samsung galaxy player.,,,
2014,5,I can't think of planning my schedule without it. Love it. Thanks.,,,
2014,5,"The best, by far... Listen to the 75,000+ other people who rated it 5 stars...The rest probably has crappy phones",,,
2014,1,"Keeps telling me there's not enough space on my nexus 4  even though there is, given months to fix but not fixed, uninstalled",,,
2017,1,Terrible new settings. Old version was much better. Uninstalled now,,,
2014,1,60% of cheap flights advertised by travel agencies on this site ar not available when you get directed to travel agency site to complete booking instead you ar given an option of  expensive flights!,,,
2014,5,Keep up the good work will always support good intentions apps. Thank you very much.,,,
2014,4,the price is not 100% accurate. always check with official website and local travel agency or u will end up paying more.,,,
2014,4,"Pretty good, I like the way that it searches from base city. But I wonder if it could after searches will it let one sort?",,,
2014,3,"Im searching for some flights and choosing but after that, in the next screen, the price is totally different, i.e, higher than the one in choosing selection, I think 25 million users have the same issue",,,
2014,5,"This is a great app for getting a quick read on flight fares. You can quickly guage what days have the best rates, and it remembers what cities you recently searched.",,,
2014,1,The app says I only have 7 gb of internal memory and I need at least 30 mb for it to work. Makes no sense.,,,
2014,5,Great application to compare ticket prices via two important variables: Airlines and different days. Whish only if purchasing the tickets made easer.,,,
2014,5,"Gostei muito do aplicativo, realmente se consegue passagens mais baratas,  sem contar que podemos visualizar os pre√ßos n√£o apenas de um dia, mas para o m√™s inteiro,  o que nos poupa tempo para planejar o dia de partida e retorno. Recomendo ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ",,,

2014,4,It's good but doesn't include an option to apply for the Balearic Islands discount.,,,
2014,4,I will give ot a 5 stars if they have notification for discount on specific flights,,,
2014,4,I like it......they should readjust it so that you can change your destination easier,,,

2014,3,It's annoying that you don't have the One way option,,,

2013,2,"I can't say how the latest version is be cause it doesn't run on a Nexus 5 with KitKat.  Others are saying they have the same problem with search results showing up empty. So far it sounds like it is a KitKat incompatibility and nothing to do with my specific phone.    I have submitted a bug report.  Please fix this, thanks.",,,
2013,2,"I had voted 5 stars for this app (loved the 'anywhere' option the calendar view), but after the latest updates I have to change my mind. search results are not as accurate anymore, Ryanair and other low cost options are often missing and the prices in the calendar view often do not correspond to the prices found with a regular search for the same day. Please fix these issues, this was one of my absolute favorite apps!!",,,
2014,2,The app works great. But it has a hard time with dollar conversion. We bought our tickets and sky scanner said it was one price in U.S. dollars and then it turns out it was really in euros so we got socked an extra $200. So pay close attention to your bill.,,,
2014,2,"I have just used the app to buy 4 return tickets from London to Geneva. No indication on the app that the tickets offered are not allowed hold luggage. ¬£500 for the tickets through Skyscanner, ¬£250 charge from the airline to allow hold luggage. Devious stuff!   Skyscanner can you set up a means to allow users to compare fares with standard terms, not just price. Can you do this early in the booking life cycle so we don't waste time looking at fares that are useless for our needs.  I am sure I am not the only user you have to be duped by assuming that luggage is normal for travelling.",,,
2013,1,Been using for a year until last update. Doesn't work now. Please fix this using on Android jellybean. Cant select dates or destination city. Keeps changing them once selected.  Filled out feedback form and sent screen shots. No update yet.,,,
2014,1,"This review is more of Skyscanner as service than the app. It used to be good. It would search globally on all the airlines and get you the cheapest price. Not anymore. At least in Asia, you are way better off without this page/app. It charges very often 50 or 100‚Ç¨ more than the price offered in main airline websites (not third party agencies, but the official airline website). In short: Their prices suck.",,,
2014,5,"With a tight budget and a whole family needing to fly back and for a lot, this app makes it so easy to find the cheapest flights all the time. I set up two searchs, for different airports or with different dates and i save it to my home screen on my phone. So with just a tap of my finger i can get the best flight deal possible and even buy tickets right then and there if the deal is good enough. This app is great!",,,
2014,2,"I used to like to use the ""Any day"" searches to find cheap flights home within in the next couple months, but barely anything shows up anymore. There's flights for the ""empty"" days when I click on them, I just wish the app grabbed all of the flights. Wouldn't even mind if it took a while with a progress bar. Also needs a refresh results button.",,,
2014,1,"I know for sure there are plenty of dirdct flights from Manchester to Fuerteventura. This app couldn't source  any direct flights at all and only came up with two airlines flying to the resort! UNINSTALLED! Although it was easy to use,  but pretty pointless if you don't get any results......",,,

2014,2,"Not only I found cheaper flights myself, but the cheapest flights sky scanner found me, all were double the price, with more than 2 stops, plus over 13 hrs. I found flights half the price, 1 stop and 4 hours utmost. Add Norwegian air + accomodation in your list and I may consider re-downloading and updating  my rate.",,,
2014,1,"Just downloaded this app, when trying to search for flights I just get no results. Really? There is not a single flight from Pheonix to New York memorial day weekend? Did not make a good first impression so I'm just uninstalling.  Been on my tablet less than 10 minutes. Developers, you might wanna fix this.",,,
2013,5,"This app actually is easier to use than the website, and it blows kayak out of the water. My only complaint would be that the airlines will have unexpected fees (like Norwegian Airline's fee to check a bag and have a meal on an international flight, wth?), but that's not sky scanner's fault. Very happy with this app. BTW, I'm using a Nexus 5.",,,
2014,4,I just installed this on a Samsung Note 10.1 2014 running Jellybean 4.3 and it won't allow me to change the currency to US dollars. Its stuck on GBP despite changing the currency in the settings. Note that I have it installed on my iPad and works fine.,,,

2013,5,Mr Dinesh Kumar malhotera like tome hello diary my friends,,,
2013,4,"I like the one-stop list of flight options across multiple airlines. I like the filter options. Everything seems to work as designed.  Here's a short list of wishes that would make this even better:  - Include a filter option to select arrival times (currently, it only allows selection on departure times.) - Include an ""email results"" option to share results with potential travel companions.  For the most part, I use this to see my options and then call our company's travel agent to book my flight. Once, I made a choice to fly into an airport that wasn't ideal because the best airport only had very expensive options. When I called my travel agent, she found a great price at the good airport that wasn't shown in this app. It was a flight between UT and CA and was a difference of about $350. It made me a bit cautious about relying wholely on this app for ""best prices"".",,,
2013,2,"First off app is really good, love it. Easy to use. There is a alternative way of viewing the results which I found works best on finding cheapest day to fly.    Second make sure your solid on your dates. I picked the wrong return date with their insurance. Called to get it changed. Their rep. Said it would cost a minimum of 250 to change it, mind you my ticket was only 120 round trip. He said I would either pay that and get reimbursed by insurance or buy a 1 way on the correct day.",,,
2013,1,"This app only finds prices but you can't just trust the sites that post them!  The first few times I used this I was perfectly happy with the results. flight picked, reserved, paid on the airlines site and ticket in about 5 to 10 minutes.  The last reservation which was a repeat of the same one last month turned into a nightmare.  took 4 days to get ticket! This app sent me over to another flight network which took my information and credit card. did not transfer me to the airline to finish the transaction then sent an email that it would take up to 2 days to get my ticket, no mention of seat assignment. 24 hrs later i get an E-ticket which the airline said was no good. the booking site was unreachable by email or phone and they claim 24/7 service which is a lie. 2hrs on hold, never picked up.  got an automated email later that they got my email but would take up to 3 business days to respond. still  no idea where my ticket or money went.  had to call the airlines customer service and after 15 minutes of searching they found my reservation unfinished, issued a correct confirmation number and  a real ticket and set my seat number.  Will never use that flight network again!",,,
2013,1,Your app appears to scan latest deals... But it's nonsense. I tried booking a flight several times now... And it say those flights are not available when it takes me to the website in order to buy. Yet the same flight remains on app search results as an option.,,,
2013,1,"the concept of the app itself is good,but this app is completely useless and is only a waste of time...why do I say so? I wonder if any of those5star reviewers ever tried to proceed all the way to booking...especially using""date bars""to select desired flight dates based on the prices it shows...-that's a complete crap: once u do all the searching&sellecting,the actual prices that will pop-up are completely different(read: a lot higher) than those given to u by the app... Try momondo - simply works better...",,,
2013,4,"A great app, nothing beats Skyscanner when it comes to cheap airfare. The website is more comprehensive, would be good to see additional features in the app in the future but very useable as it is. Personally, I find it annoying that the app is titled 'flights' in the menu, I have it set alphabetically and I'm looking for Skyscanner. Minor minor thing though.",,,
2013,1,"Wow, this app is rubbish. So far I've had to scroll through every combination of outward and return rather than picking each individually. And after all that, the price on the list is not the actual price. Everything it can do wrong, it does wrong. Did the work experience kid design this? Even the comment section doesn't work. Jesus Christ.",,,
2013,4,It is a useful app and reliable and shows you all available air ways even domestic flight but you can't proceed the booking from the apps (I can't open the web). I think it need integration between the apps and the airways website so you can finish off your booking easily.    I am using Samsung galaxy note 2,,,
2013,4,"One point a lot of non connecting tickets, which require a risky change between two bookings, come up e.g changing planes at Ryanair hubs. This is great and can save some money, but obviously isn't for everybody and it would be great if there was an option to filtering out these results if desired.  Great app tho, and opens up new flying options",,,
2013,2,I used this app previously and it was excellent not until today. When I ran my saved searches it always prompted me that I am not connected to the internet. I am certain im connected coz I can browse websites and access google store. Please advise or check. Thanks.,,,
2013,2,"The widget had been working fine for me, but now it just shows no results for two cities where I know there are direct flights between them.    The skyscanner site works fine.   The widget seems broke.",,,
2013,1,BEware. Used application to find cheapest flight. Skyscanner sends you to faregeek. You book through fare geek and you put in cc# you try and select seats and yiu cant but worse than that there was nothing said about baggage fees. We print ticket and get frontiers tickets (you don't know until now who your flying with). Now we show up and we ended up paying $50 eavh for carryon each way. I could have booked through airline cheaper,,,
2013,1,I have purshased tickets using this app and the agent company faregeek charged me extra amount on my credit card almost $230 when I called them they said it was a glitch in the system and will refund me that amount but they never did it. Also I saw fees of $52 on each ticket on my statement for skylink which I don't know what is that for? The credit card company doesn't know why they charged me this fees? Sounds like phishy or scam. The credit card company have opened dispute case file for investigation.,,,
2013,3,"The airport in Medan has been moved to Kualanamu International Airport (KNO). And most of the airlines have changed the airport code in their databases to KNO. it'll be a big help for us in Medan if you guys update the app. Other than that, it's a great app. Thanks in advance.",,,
2013,5,"As one who travel often, I am always looking for ways to make my task of finding cheap and great flights. I have experimented with other apps, but now that I found Skyscanner I am very happy.   It has a huge variety of flights all over the world; it is fast, it is accurate, and it finds the greatest price for you. You can trust Skyscanner; it will make you happy because it is effective, reliable, and fast.",,,
2016,2,"The new fancy looking update of the app unfortunately forgets the basics, meaning it takes a series of random taps before you get to the simple flight search option. It's a bit of a mess unfortunately and is no use to me now so I've had to delete it.",,,
2013,4,"The best part about this app?  you don't need to have a destination or date.  if the result could be viewed in calendar form & the bar graph results worked better, 5 Stars.",,,
2013,4,"You have to play a lil bit with it to get the best prices, like filtering options.  I think its great if you have flexible travel dates.  Also it includes nearby airports which gives you more options. Very satisfied!",,,
2014,1,"App just doesn't work, updated with KitKat.  Not happy there is no external sd card I think.  Used developer option but searches didn't work after that, although app opened.",,,
2017,1,"Terrible app. Can't set range of travel dates, filter options minimal, can only sort in one direction, didn't find several flights that Kayak did. Went back to browser search.",,,
2013,5,"Avg anti virus flags this as malware so uninstalled it.  In response to the reply received from my rateing, I csn confirm that I have reinstalled this app and completed a full AVG anti virus scan with no alerts on completion.  Great app and thanks to creators for contacting Grisoft with regards false positive detection.",,,
2013,1,"Sure, this app looks nice and it's easy to use, but the prices are a scam. Don't believe me?  Try this...MSP to MCO, round trip. It comes back with 366. But there are NO tickets for that price.  You select it and first you find out its 665 to get to MCO, and another 895 to get home. Actual price 1560 PER PERSON. this is a waste of your time...don't bother.",,,
2013,4,This app is so easy to use and brilliant for finding cheap flights! My only problem is that the prices displayed are only representative so actual prices are often slightly more but not by much. Still so much easier to use and find good deals than other sites etc!,,,
2013,2,Was excited when I saw prices and the way u can see prices on all callendar dates. I went to book a flight to Thailand from Auckland nz at $897 and i realized it was in AUSD NOT NZD. So when i was abou to check out the tottal was up to $1149.  There is also no way to change currency.,,,
2013,4,"Smart app. Good widget that monitors the flights your looking for, so you can see when their at their cheapest.   Bad point is you can only search for single destination flights. No multiple destination flight searches.",,,
2013,1,"The prices are good and there its a great deal of flexibility in terms of travel dates but when its time to book the flight, it can never be found. Also there its no one at the other end of the customer service line. Its good on paper! Disappointed.",,,
2014,4,I love the ease of searching and being able to modify criteria. I would love it more if I could set up an alert with my time frame (given flexibility of +/- specified days) and be notified when prices drop. That would make this app 5 stars.,,,
2013,4,Convenient to search cheap flights. But maybe can include a table where u can see which days have the cheapest rates. And also not complete list of airlines....some airlines which are not included in this app are cheaper,,,
2013,5,"The app is easy to navigate. It's not the most advanced UI, but certainly does the trick. Finding good fares on here saves plenty of time.",,,
2013,1,I had the itinerary on the screen and when clicking individually to each site to book the flights the prices and the time did not match at all! I have wasted money in the bookings and now I have to stay overnught waiting for a connection flight. DONT USE THE APP UNLESS YOU CHECK IT SEPARATELY FROM THE COMPANIES FIRST.... SO TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,,,
2013,4,"An appreciative, user-friendly app that makes your flight search easy n fast. Reliability yet to decide.  So above average.	An appreciative, user-friendly app that makes your flight search easy n fast. Reliability yet to decide.  So above average.",,,
2013,5,So many flexible options. Many connections and countries to choose from. Flexible calender. Try it.  I'm sure you will like it like I did. No complaints.,,,
2013,3,It's good to know where your local airport flies to and where you can get to your destination from but it's not always precise in its information. For instance you request direct flights only and it seems to give you them till you delve deeper to find there are stopovers thus wasting your time. Still it had its uses.,,,
2013,1,"Worked yesterday, now search doesn't work. The app says that internet connection is required, even though I am connected. Please fix asap!",,,
2013,4,"Very good, especially since it's free. Might be my phone, but crashes a lot; gets right back up, though. Add ""tickets left"" feat and it'll be perfect.",,,
2013,2,When  you select the flight you want to book it then takes you to a third party website where invariably the flight you chose isn't available. Then there is an option to phone where you can spend 20 mins before they try to sell you a more expensive flight,,,
2013,4,"I love this app and use it all the time to get an idea of flight costs. Works well, but website better because it is able to give you suggestions for cheaper flights from other airports and destinations.",,,
2013,1,The new update is totally pathetic... whenever i search ne thing it always shows no connection... I  was loving it before but now m very dissapointed,,,
2013,4,Really nice app. Especially like the functionality that allows you to search for the cheapest flight over time. Would get 5 stars but often the price increases dramatically when you click through to your chosen flight which obviously is no good!,,,
2013,2,"This app has some basic drawbacks. No multi-destination ability! It also seems expensive, so they do not have the resources that other site must have.",,,
2013,5,"The cheapest flights! Quick & easy! The bar graph is perfect for viewing the cheapest days to fly, without having to search each date! Thank you for this app- it has saved me so much time and money!",,,
2013,3,"Why is it called ""flights"" on the app drawer instead of skyscanner? Makes it hard to find alphabetically when you have a lot of apps in your phone",,,
2013,5,This app works within seconds as opposed to going ro carious web sites.  It finds deals and no need to keep re-keying location as it remembers. Im smiling,,,
2013,2,"Search for flights, get the price, then once you press book all it does is take you to the airline's website where you have to enter the flight details all over again. Why not transfer the details automatically? Waste of time. Uninstalling.",,,
2013,5,I'm very impressed with this app and the charts for cost per date is extremely usefull to find the cheapest flights. Wish there was currency choice and phone numbers specific to current country.,,,

2013,5,"((( UNBELIEVABLE,,,  EXTREMELY-------COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL[][][][][][][]",,,
2013,3,I can't finding airlines from indonesia for international trip,,,
2013,5,Itz gud aplctn to check ticket rate and ticket buking......,,,
2013,5,I really like this appplication because it is very useful,,,
2013,5,I recommend this app to anyone who are on the go!!!,,,
2013,5,Search results of Android app Skyscanner sometimes don't correlate with search results of usual Skyscanner.,,,
2013,5,"A must app, check the prices on this app before booking any flight tickets",,,
2013,5,"Hey, i downdload this app just for get stars in getjar",,,
2013,5,It gives all possible options of price and connections.,,,
2013,2,"Nothing out there compares Southwest~ which kicks the competition most always-to other airlines. Annoying. Why would I use  this app when I can pull it up quicker on my laptop? NOW, if this compared rates against SW airlines, and I could one stop shop, it would be a unique, AWESOMEEEEE  app!  I will pass til more airlines are added, thanks!",,,
2013,1,"This app is supposed to allow users the ability to compare flights in order to book cheap, convenient travel, but a quick visit to the websites of the suggested airlines showed many flights not provided by this app that are most often available for a fraction of the suggested price. Furthermore, I searched a flight that had departure and return flights advertised at $98 each, when clicked on I was forwarded to info for a flight costing $1,400 - this happened consistently. Pretty close I guess...",,,
2013,1,"In comparison to the original releases, I've rated 5 stars, then 3, and now 1 in a years time. The prices are NEVER accurate anymore and only gets your hopes up, and on top of that, I have found that this app sometimes uses third parties, and prices are $10 higher than buying the ticket directly. SHAME!",,,
2013,5,I like that you can search flight prices for the whole month and not just certain dates making each search far more flexible. I've downloaded many apps like this to try and find better but I can't find better. It would be even better if there was more flexibility with destinations when using connection flights like flying to a different airport on the way home from a destination from the connection airport used going to your final destination. Also there should be an option to mix airlines for journey's.,,,
2013,3,"being able to search for flexible dates and nearby airports is essential to finding the lowest price. this app doesn't give me that option. I do like being able to find the lowest price to ""anywhere""! I will keep it just for that feature.",,,
2013,4,"I'm a frequent traveler and waste many hours combing all the websites for cheapest rate. I was  amazed that this app actually includes all my favorites, includes special deals only listed on airline websites, etc. Saves me the hassle of doing 50 million searches.",,,
2013,3,"Used to love this app, but since the last update the time of day filter doesn't register, even after accepting changes and pressing done. On my device anyway. It's not very efficient.",,,
2013,5,"This app is perfect. I love that I can search for a range of dates from a specific departure city to ""anywhere"" (or vice versa) if I'm not sure where I want to go for vacation. So far, the cheapest prices are here..not on one of the billions of travel sites (which also don't have the open ended search feature). A must have app for travelers!!",,,
2016,1,Used to be the best app for finding the cheapest deals to everywhere. Is really hard to navigate and can't do what you want any more after update. Gutted.,,,
2013,1,One way option? Multi city option? Adding children?  Where are these basic functions?? There are real alternatives (e.g. Kayak) which this app is just not up to.,,,
2013,1,All flights that u look fir has already been taken. The most annoying app ever. Dont waste your time downloading it. Had to go to flightcentre direct to book my flights..,,,
2013,5,"Plenty of nice and easy-accessible features. App is fast and intuitive. However flight prices differ slightly, data seems to be delayed, not real time.",,,
2013,4,"No comments.  The app is good. It gives the ability to search for flights without determining the exact date of departure and arrival.  Also, it provides an option to check other bookings on different website.",,,
2013,2,"Started out as 2 x $330 fares, with extra charges and bank conversion fees ended up costing $790. Didn't realise I was booking with overseas co until it was completed.  I won't be using again.",,,
2013,4,"Great app, but does not show all options. Sometimes it misses some airlines. I say that because I check myself the missed ones.",,,
2013,4,I really like this app. Its easy to use and has the best deals. Would be great if you had a multidestination option too:),,,
2013,4,Shows the best n cheapest connectivity using multiple airlines' scheduler.,,,
2013,5,"Great fir finding the best deals. In constant use on my phone, only waiting for the airline ti release schedules.",,,
2013,2,"If you want to book in 10 months forward. There is no ""air asia"". Everybody in asia knows that air asia is the cheapest. I compare it from air asia website there's a flight that is cheaper..",,,
2013,4,"Good UI, and quick booking site, needing a quick prompt to get to the airports and Android phones, being too sensitive to the touch needs a prompt to not exit the page, or maybe a slight delay.",,,
2013,5,"The UI, functions, triggers, exceptions in the app are far away from being lame. Very nice app from a very very nice developer. It helps many people though, would kindly recommend this to others.",,,
2013,4,Works well and shows general prices quickly. Then you can narrow the  search and flight. Worked well so far,,,
2013,4,Great way to check your flight prices just wish they had a graph of your prices so you can see if it went up/down,,,
2013,5,Identify your local airport and find out where you can get to from it. Then check out the deals. Fantastic tool.,,,
2013,4,"The app is beautifully designed, works fine and fast. Unfortunately, I've got better prices going directly to the agency, so I only use it as a reference.",,,
2013,4,"I could see that in the app there is only air india flight from trivandrum to male but in real there is another flight ""maldivian"" also. hope you would work on it",,,
2013,5,Nice app dude... Really can scan and provide u the best fare... Very much user friendly....,,,
2013,4,"Great comparison tool. All you need to now about existing airlines and routes, all in one place. This app is fab.",,,
2013,5,I appreciate the app. it is absolutely perfect. now I am able to search a fligh in a sec.it gives all info. covers all the airlines in the world. thank you,,,
2013,1,"I have an HTC one S, and when i search for a flight it says that i must have an internet connection to perform the search. And I have internet connection... Something's wrong with the app",,,
2013,5,Don't even bother trying anything else. This app will give you all the options available.,,,
2013,1,Has ad banners.  There are better ones that don't.  Also the Iphone version is far superior to this one.,,,
2013,5,One of the best app for online ticket booking (only) via mobile. What I liked the most is the capability to mark favorite the itineraries and view the recent searches.   Would be far better if we could select multiple cities during search.,,,
2013,5,"this is so helpful, being a traveller and a frequent flyer. they find the best deals!! so worth it i love this app",,,
2013,5,"Interesting feature is that you dont even need to give specific destination, can search everywhere in any country and choose the place based on price",,,
2013,5,"I've been using this app to find the cheapest, and greatest flights ever. I just love it, it makes my life easier within my budget. I don't usually rate apps, unless they are pretty good or awful, and Skyscanner is just great!",,,
2013,5,"I have been using this app for at least 2 years since HTC one x, very good app..well done.",,,
2014,1,"Used to love Skyscanner bc it was so quick, convenient, user friendly etc, but since the recent update it is literally the opposite. SUCK SUCK major SUCK",,,
2013,5,Works great on my Galaxy Note 2. Very quick and thorough in finding available flights. Highly recommended!,,,
2013,5,I used this app to book flights within Europe. I found some great deals but the best thing is it is easy to use.,,,
2013,5,This is how all Android apps should work. Better than many Airlines desktop sites. Well done!,,,
2013,3,Works fine until you try and pay. It opens the browser but doesn't load a page.,,,
2013,1,"This prices this app gives you are lower than the actual cost, it quotes you a a really good price then when comes to actually booking the flight the price goes up. I ended up finding cheaper flights myself without the help of skyscanner.",,,
2013,5,"Really easy to use.  sometimes.I don't know where I want to go, I just know I want to go somewhere.  I select anywhere and anytime and the app lists all the best places to go at the best prices.  Perfect for me",,,
2013,4,"I used it to find and book a return flight to Paris. Process was easy, flight was cheap and everything went smoothly. Can't ask for more.",,,
2013,5,"The only one of its kind. Easy and cheap! Thank you for the many times I have used you.

   Pppaulp",,,
2013,5,"Full marks for being intuitive, and bonus marks for the money it saves. This app is a must have for the frequent traveler who funds his own trips.",,,
2013,5,Connects to ALL ticket vendors databases. Start with country to country with anytime travel to get the best price possible.,,,
2013,5,You *need* this app if you are planning on flying anywhere. You can specify dates or you can easy compare prices over a whole month if you are flexible. Definitely a prerequisite for anyone looking for a flight.,,,
2013,1,BS...! You see one price.. after this you being redirected.. and prices goes UP! Same like in website.,,,
2013,4,"Very convenient to use! As for improvement, the price should also state if it's included tax and surcharge",,,
2013,5,Skyscanner has saved me thousands in the ten years I've used the site. Now I can take it everywhere I go with this great app. To infinity and beyond...!,,,
2013,5,Never seen before deals available with excellent economic price. This app suits the best for me!,,,
2013,5,Really good for booking flights and planning holidays. I wish there were a similar app for hotels and car hire too. Excellent overall and very easy to use!,,,
2013,4,Very simple to use. Currently try to track pricing for two trips and it allows me to bounce back and forth without having to reset it every time.,,,
2013,4,"if the widget search could have filters applied to, it would be perfect. (i need max 1stop filter)",,,
2013,3,"Its great app,, unless it can give a right price. It often say a low price when i try too book it the price much more higher than the estimation it give",,,
2013,5,So easy to get results! Is very flexible when entering your own  requirements for searches. I like it and recommend it as probably the only app you'll ever need for it's purpose.,,,
2013,4,But its not direct booking therefore still route to main airline for booking.. u have to key multiple times if u doing many cities,,,
2013,5,"Applikasi yg cocok banget buat yg hobi traveling.. banyak pilihan, cuma tinggal update beberapa penerbangan aja.. Mantap!!",,,
2013,5,Accurate. Purchased ticket in an emergency with the help of this app. Thank you and keep it up :),,,

2013,5,"The greatest service ever, you will save hundreds on flight costs! This app is also very similar to the desktop version!",,,
2013,4,It doesn't inform you that it could be cheaper to pay in a different currency/with a different billing country. eg I found a flight from Vancouver to London for $600 cheaper when I searched in CAD instead of GBP,,,
2013,5,This app is brilliant and simple I was able to find what I was looking for in seconds and booking it was made even easier thanks Skyscanner!,,,
2013,1,For fun I've had it running for over a month on a particular flight:  Hasn't changed at all.  Not one penny.  Bogus app.,,,
2013,5,Just booked my flights to South Africa. So easy to search and find the best deals.,,,
2013,4,Can't find this necessary function.  Loads fast. Seamless.  Joy to use,,,
2013,5,"It always good to know the you move around the places cause you learn, in other words this section is important for me plus friends & family in general, we can check see each other or even make a better planning depending the cash at hand and this applies to which flight fits best this idea is impressing idea.",,,

2013,5,"I love this app. I have purchased tickets using this app only twice, but it is so easy to use that I even use it to check prices when I am curious.",,,
2013,4,The app is great for seeing price trends.  This is very useful for holiday planning.  The only drawback I have found is sometimes there are gaps in the prices.,,,
2013,5,"Great App saves time over using individual web sites and finds you the cheapest rate. Really good if your flexible, love the extended view.",,,
2013,4,It's fast and easy to use. But some rates show cheaper can be more expensive when it move to other parties website.,,,
2013,5,Comes up with all the best options.... Very easy to use and UI,,,
2013,4,It will be the best if this programme can compare multi destination journey. Anyway its already been helpfull to me for getting the idea which airlines I need to compare,,,

2013,1,It only checks airports nearby me. I want to check MANY in the states. Let down.....,,,
2013,3,This app was great. Now it shows a low fair on search and shows a diff fair in the final booking page. Fix it,,,

2013,4,Ive noticed you can get cheaper from local travel centers not all the time but just a heads up  either way its very good,,,
2013,5,Works great and is quick. Don't use the computer to find fares anymore.,,,

2013,5,Memudahkan dalam mencari rute dan harga pemerbangan dr berbagai maskapai penerbangan...,,,
2013,5,If you travel frequently then this app is a must have for you.,,,
2013,1,"I'm attempting to book a flight from the app (doesn't work, no page reference) the app states the cost is $109 and the site says $164.   MISLEADING AND INACCURATE PRICING  UPDATE:  I used Orbitz and it was WAY simple and $12 less expensive. no redirecting, the price is right there with tax and you buy within the app. I'm no longer recommending Skyscanner until it improves the experience. #Uninstall",,,
2013,4,"This is by far my favourite app. It has given me the abbility to visit my dad overseas for the 1st time in 4 years. Flights that even the consultants don't know about!! I took my phone into the travel agency and spent ages finding a cheap flight... Take out my phone, smash on the app 30secs find a cheaper flight. Already enjoyed 1 holiday this year looking forward to the UK in July!!",,,
2013,2,"Downloaded the app to double check n see if I got a good deal on airfare to Scottsdale Municipal Airport in Arizona and it doesn't even list that as a valid destination... Kind of hard for me to give a good review when the app boasts ""every flight everywhere""... I was really hoping to use this app. Guess I will have to follow up after an update..",,,
2013,4,"I use this app pretty often. Love the ""Travel To: Everywhere"" feature and convenient rate calendar/ filtering format. My only complaint is that Skyscanner doesn't offer a multi-city option for flight searches! Other than that, I highly recommend it.",,,
2013,3,"Overall, works well to book flights.  However, they did a poor job with time options on the return flights.  Example- Your departure flight is 5pm and return departure time on option is 8am.  You rather return on a LATER flight. There isn't a way to choose RETURN depature times, Expedia's and CheapOair app does a better job on that point.",,,
2013,5,"Often smartphone apps are crowded and confusing. This however is simple, fast, intuitive, and works brilliantly. The developers clearly understand that software is only as good as the weakest point, but this wins on all counts. PLEASE don't go the way of so many developers and destabilise it with unnecessary updates and features that few want - it's great already! Kudos !!!",,,
2013,5,"For two weeks i would dread looking for flights on my phone because it was so time consuming! But... saw an add on facebook for this app. I knew it was an awsome website, because i previously booked my husbands ticket with the help of skyscanner when all other airlines and travel agents were telling me there were no flights for the nxt day under $900! I found such a cheap flight on skyscanner straight after I downloaded it on my phone, better than Webjet for sure!! I found it Faster too. Thanks skyscanner.",,,
2013,1,"It worked when I first loaded it, in a cumbersome way, and then after a week it just stopped with an error message: ""Unfortunately Skyscanner has stoped."" you are then given two options: Report - which does not work; or OK ...mind you there is a third one called ""uninstall"".",,,
2013,4,"I like that this app allows you to search not only specific airport but once close to the airport, this comes in handy when you live near several airports as I do, find the cheapest flight these days is key! Since the latest update I'm not overly thrilled with the search engine but otherwise this is a pretty good app I would definitely recommend it.",,,
2013,3,"Works fine and the platform is lovely, however the only problem is that the actual links to book the flights simply don't work! This means it's only good for comparing flights, but certainly not for booking them.",,,
2013,5,"My husband is from the UK and I am from the US so our families do a lot of international travel to visit our loved ones.  This app is a great way to track prices and find the best time to travel.    It's easy to use for and level of computer literacy.  This app has an interface so user friendly and intuitive that even if you have never traveled by plane in your life, buying an international plane ticket is no harder than ordering a pizza online!",,,
2013,5,"Don't waste time on advertised flights you can't actually book. Searches easyjet ryanair etc as well. Sometimes even cheaper than booking direct. Fly twice a week and skyscanner saves me a lot of time money and frustration. Skyscanner, thank you!",,,
2013,5,"I booked my trip from the UK, around Canada, USA and Cuba using this app and it was fantastic! Now I'm using it to book my next holiday to Vienna. Can't go wrong with this app. Very easy to use and organise anything with. Thanks Skyscanner!",,,
2013,1,"United has direct flights between BTV and CLE. When I filter for airline and nonstop, I get 25 results, none of which are the nonstops. App also crashes when I try to share results. Uninstalled and reinstalled it, but no improvement. Wrote to them over 2 weeks ago about these problems and got an automatic response but never a useful or helpful response.",,,
2013,4,"Works good, but am not sure if it's showing all flights. Found a cheaper flight on here, and was going to book, but after reading reviews regarding that aspect, got a little skeptical. Otherwise, I love it",,,
2013,5,Very good app. Very useful fast and you can get all the infos you need at one place! The only thing is weird sometime it doesnt say the price so you need to chose the dates and go to next page to see how much will the flight cost you. But its just a small thing;),,,
2012,1,"This app does not seem to know that 1 of the largest airports in the area exist! It also requires you to search each airport individually, unless you want to search the US as a whole. Useful if it happens to have your airport, and you don't mind searching eat 1 individually to find the best price. They're really much better alternatives and I would rather find a computer than use this app.",,,
2013,4,It's very user friendly and reliable. Have never seen anything better than this. But each time I have to filter by changing the destination have to go all the way back to first page and can't just change it on the page I am on. Rest all good.,,,
2013,1,Easy to use but gave me prices for flights that could not be booked. These prices didn't even show up on the skyscanner website when I searched in my browser. Very disappointed at the false advertising.,,,
2013,1,"App has made up of excellent idea but nly isuue m having is ""inaccurate flight rates"" there is huge difference between shown price an actual price. Sometimes 10x. With this bug there is no use of this. Pease fix it and I will give 5",,,
2013,5,Got to be one of the best flight search app out there . I used to have to go and look in all airlines websites and look under ten‚Äôs of category but now its different story. Looking for flight became something that take 5 to 15 min. All thanks to Skyscanner.  I only wish that it has  multi-city option.,,,
2013,4,"One search on this app equates to many on individual airline websites. Easy way to find your ideal flights. First price tag is not the final deal, do not give your hopes up on ultra cheap flights.",,,
2013,2,I don't really think those 5 star reviews are real. This app sucks. Not one mention of it taking you to the browser to complete the purchase. No point in having an app if it just takes you to their website.,,,
2013,4,"love this app, so useful and easy to use. Can book flights right from my phone. Only complaint is it sometimes shows trips and prices that are no longer available, takes a bit to refresh I guess.",,,
2013,4,Great way to check airfare and is also very quick and easy to use. I like to use this initially for flights then go to hotwire or priceline to book. Would be 5 stars easily if it had a function where it could alert you to cheap fares like watchdog.,,,
2013,5,If you fly at least a couple times a year and especially if its a repeated trip.. its amazing. Just constantly monitor the same flights for the best deal possible.,,,
2013,5,This is an awesome application. Very handy and useful. Should add option to search destinations carry out by particular airlines. Looking forward more features from the developers.. Keep going.. Best wishes..,,,
2013,4,"That's all that needs to be said... Doesn't freeze or any sorta complications.. only use it to find flights though, never actually bought tickets from it",,,
2013,4,Very easy to use and pretty straight forward.   Perhaps the system could implement and state clearly which are the code sharing flight. At the moment I didn't see any.   It would be best if there we can see what equipment will be used for particular flight in search mode.   Cheers.,,,
2013,5,"This is the best I have ever used, I like the way I can book my flight from anywhere in the world from any place. Don't try and tweak or upgrade, if something works leave it alone. Thanks",,,
2013,4,Very user friendly and generally finds very good prices.  Would be even better if there was an option to do multi-city searches.,,,
2013,4,"The price was not very accurate, but skyscanner helped me plan my holiday with the ""to everywhere"" option.  It lists all flights from your local airport by price.",,,
2013,1,"You pick your departure then suddenly the return prices jump up a ton! I don't think a last minute flight to Vegas would cost 500 per person. And let me guess, tax on top of that right? Can stay at New York New York for 4 nights plus nonstop flight $1500 Incl tax on any popular travel site. So why is this a savings?",,,
2013,3,"Works well if I put in departure dates. Almost never returns a result if I leave departure date as ""any"", which is why I'd choose this app over, say, Kayak.",,,
2013,5,"I can't believe I didn't know about this before! It is fast, gives an excellent variety of flights to choose from and easy to operate. I recommend it to anyone looking for a deal and frequent travelers.",,,
2013,5,I love skyscanner. The app is very easy to use and I found the best flight (money wise and time wise) to Italy for way less than I expected to spend on a flight ticket. Thanks for saving me a bundle!,,,
2013,5,I am always looking up flights im so glad i found this app!! It has saved me so much time. I use to look up all different sites but Skyscanner puts them all in the one app. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a simple user face but maximum real time results,,,
2013,5,Could do with the car hire search like the website. Still best I've found for cheap flights though. Guess some people would like the hotel option too,,,
2013,4,Very good app. I have used it for apple and android its very fast and gets the bedt prices.  The interface with the airlines could be sharper but then that could as much to do with their website.,,,
2013,5,"Brilliant! Was having a challenging time matching holidays with flights; this fits the bill. Prices not perfect, maybe due to baggage and taxes etc.",,,
2013,5,I used to use all the separate airline websites to hunt down the best fares. This saves me the hour it would take! 30 seconds or so and you have all the options you could ever need. A must download!,,,
2013,4,Very easy and fast. Just what you need to check many flights fast. Give 4 as I havent pay for any flights after finding here and Im not sure all right prices. For browsing  for me brilliant!,,,
2013,5,...and has improved over time. Great for scanning a period of time to find the cheapest flights to somewhere. Much better correlation between headline  and actual prices.,,,
2013,5,"Nice UI, easy to navigate. Wide variety of flights, I was pessimistic that it will have any flights on Indonesia but they have it all. Definitely a must have for air traveler.",,,
2013,3,Good app so far but if you can only choose the date and time for flight out but return no choice. Pls provide this option. Thank you,,,
2013,5,It's the easiest flight booking application out there and has the very cheapest prices.  No complex forms to fill in at the start.  Really excellent.  Galaxy Note 2.,,,
2013,5,Skyscanner is great! I recently booked a flight saving 400/ person. I love the calendar feature on their website unfortunately the app only has the chart that I scroll through to get prices. Sometime the website and the app has different prices as well.,,,
2013,5,"Skyscanner is simple, fast and provides the cheapest prices. It has awesome search options like looking for flights from country to country, not just airport to airport. I recommend heartily!",,,
2013,5,"I travel quite a lot and this app has helped so much making it easier to find cheap flights. It searches lots of different airlines, works surprisingly fast and I love the ability to share flights or book them straight from the app.",,,
2013,4,Great for quick comparisons.  May hang once in a while but a solid app for the most part. Highly recommended but not perfect. Well worth the price of free...,,,
2013,5,The love of my life is a Marine currently in Southern California. This app allows me to check prices fast and monitor fluctuations to find the very best deals :),,,
2013,5,I traveled thru Europe to 8 different countries last year and the cheapest deals I founded thru this website! And this app makes it much more accessible... great site and app!,,,
2013,2,"The app displays the lowest fare for destinations, but when I try to find that fare it's nowhere to be seen. I have looked and not once found the cheapest advertised fare. Also, many of the fares are hidden below with a ^ symbol. There's no explanation as to what that symbol means or why fares are hidden.",,,
2013,5,"Being on the run, it was  impossible to make sure I'm getting the best travel deal. However Sky scanner makes is adequately convenient... Love it",,,
2013,5,"Simply the best airfare comparison app on Google Play Store bar none. Excellent interface, good filters and able to scroll along a dateline to see fares on adjoining days. Brilliant.",,,
2013,1,I don't know how good is inside the us but international prices sucks! Cheapest one charges double what I usually pay!! My advice do ur own womework,,,
2013,4,quick results and easy to use! please add the only airport i use outside my home state (Orange County- John Wayne airport) and i'd rate 6 stars if i could!,,,
2012,1,I don't blame the App' but the information that is fed to liescanner is nothing short of fabrication by the travel agencies... I have not found 1 flight for the cheapest price advertised. These are always independents and not the actual airlines themselves.,,,
2013,4,Usability Is near perfect. Love the interface. Ensure harmony by pairing with Kayak doe cross checking flight prices.  Check it out !,,,
2013,2,"Even when not in use for days it's always taking 9~20MB and CPU time, ence draining the battery.  If a user closes an app, he wants it close, not running on the background taking memory and draining the battery.",,,
2013,5,This app is pretty good and easy to use. It would be awesome if future updates could add the hotel search feature as the website does now. Highly recommend this app!,,,
2013,5,"Easy to find cheapest flights for a planned trip or random adventure! love that you can leave the destination field blank, and just find somewhere cheap and go, great interface too, and very accurate pricing.",,,
2013,4,"Seems very complete, I haven't really used it much in real life, but I certainly will next time I travel, well done, thanks.",,,
2013,4,It's a very helpfull web which can significantly save your time to browse all available airways one by one. The android-version is even much more time-efficient and easier to use.,,,
2013,5,"I have used many engines to search flights but there is nothing compared to this. Its simple, easy, and fast to list lots of flights to your destination. Also switching destinations and take off locations is quick. Amazingly, this app keeps track of your search record so that any time you can see what and where you have desired  go. If yoi are new to this app, relax its the best one out there. Google rocks!",,,
2013,5,"I can honestly say I LOVE this app! I have a number of apps and this is my favorite by far. I love to fly when I travel, however as we all know it can be expensive, this app makes it easy to fly because it finds the best flight for you. Very easy to use and navigate. My friends are shocked whenI can find a better price than anyone else. You will have the ability to do the same with Skyscanner!",,,
2013,5,"I love the website, the app is as good. Simple to use and accurate its difficult to see what extra features you need. Thoroughly recommend this to any traveller.",,,
2013,2,Doesnt give me more than one flight per day and its usually not the cheapest . Nice app but doesnt work properly in canada. Nice interface tho .,,,
2013,3,Were always looking for a promo fare here in the phillippines! But the promos doesnt shown here in this app! Stil im signing in at google search,,,
2013,5,I found it very helpful while I was planning to take my family on holiday. I was waiting for the best deal to buy and this app check the flight deals on the go. Thanks,,,
2013,4,Excellent app. Just need to be careful to check the single trip button when doing a quick search for who flies where and when. Also you can easily end up looking at flights 2 months ahead of when you want to fly.,,,
2013,5,I like this app. It's simple and thanks for the last update regarding the Omani rial. But I hope to see the multi-destination booking option.,,,

2013,4,Just used this app to book my next flight.....works like a dream and beat all the competition on price........only thing it needs is a 'flexible dates' option.....with this it'd be 5 Stars,,,
2013,5,Really beats going from one site to another any comparing. Some airlines which i don't normall check out are also included and sometimes comes out as the better option..tnx!,,,
2012,5,"I love the layout of this app. Very easy to use - not tried to book anything through it yet, but am impressed so far.",,,
2013,2,"Tried to book a flight with RyanAir, not only did it take very long for everything to load (waiting 3+ seconds after pressing any button), but when I pressed the button ""Book"", it redirected me just to the homepage of RyanAir, not the page with my travel information...",,,
2013,1,THIS APP IS A FRAUD. It shows you low price and takes you to faregeek's website WHICH IS A FRAUD. IT TAKES YOUR MONEY AWAY AND CANCELS YOUR TICKET WHICH YOU HAVE TO PAY AGAIN FOR THE CANCELLATION. DONOT USE IT..,,,
2013,1,Needs a refresh feature after adjusting filter and it doesn't remember filter settings. Uninstalling till it gets finished.,,,
2013,1,Checked 4 flights   one to guangzhou from Alaska.   had to go to dubai first. Took two days for flight.   1660 cost.   Found two flights on Expedia and vayama That were 80 to 100 cheaper and only took 16 hrs.  Flights went to Beijing then to guangzhou versus dubai!!!,,,
2013,5,"Excellent app, cheap flights and great flexibility like whole month, go anywhere, all major currencies. Helped me get to NZ to UK very cheaply, thanks :-)",,,
2013,4,Love the app but I wish you could filter out certain airlines that you don't want to use. It can be a hassle sorting through prices when trying to avoid certain carriers.,,,
2013,5,Very user friendly. Returns searches quickly and gives just the right amount of information. Best flight search tool around. Highly recommended.,,,
2013,4,Great application although it doesn't feature all flights from Bulgaria so yiu still need to search more. But it is very  useful in offering flight combinations,,,
2013,5,"Actually got a very good price not picked up elsewhere.  Which given prices lately, definitely appreciated. Thanks",,,
2013,3,"Only shows cebu pacific only. Please update to invlude philippine airlines, air phil express, tiger airways, zest air, seair and air asia.",,,
2013,1,"Interesting concept, but confusing ui.  The prices it returns are way too high. Uninstalling",,,

2013,5,Works well and fast. Filters and timeline price view are really useful. Great ui. Highly recommended.,,,

2013,5,Very easy to use with a great layout of the best prices for a certain month. I find this app better to use than my p.c!,,,
2013,5,Quick access to the latest prices and a great layout. The widget is a nice touch for when I want to keep an eye on a certain destination.,,,
2013,3,Here in the Philippines Airlines are frequently offering promo fare. I suggest that it should also be shown. Like now from June 15 to 18 they are offering up to P18.00 for domestic flights travel period from June onwards,,,
2013,1,I refused to believe the cheapest flight to my destination was over a thousand dollars got on internet and first link found the same flight for 631. This was a waste of time,,,
2013,5,Easy to use and finds amazingly cheap tickets. I've only had it on my phone for about 20 minutes & I've already recommended it to others!,,,
2013,5,I use this app everytime I plan a trip. Consistently provides the best prices along with a number of tools for customizing your travels.,,,
2013,5,Wonderfull app and great site in general!! It is so easy to have a good overview of ALL options available on the market!! If you don't have it installed this is a sure MUST!!,,,
2013,5,Amazingly fast. I don't know how they do it but it works. Well worth 5 stars,,,
2013,4,Can get 5 star if open-jaw search option is included.,,,
2012,4,Could use an updated UI and a more accurate fare predictor (calendar view) to spot deals.,,,
2013,5,I like it much better than other travel sites they do t do mobile well. Picked it up I Norway from my best friend best.,,,
2013,2,Good app but I cannot find any.of the cheapest priced flights when going into the detail. Frustrating.,,,
2013,5,"Helpful but you won't really see all budgeted promos from all airlines. Nonetheless, I get most of my cheap flights from skyscanner.",,,

2013,5,"I love this app. I'd previously used the website on the pc, but the app is even quicker to use. Just remember the price quoted by Ryanair doesnt include their extortionate baggage charge, crazy!!!!",,,
2013,5,I never thought that this app is a real deal!.. 5 star isnt enough.. I wil give dis app 10 stars..great job!,,,
2013,4,Only so that allows unspecified dates and will return prices over a timeline. This allows you to plan trips around prices much easier.,,,
2013,4,I like my last minute deals and like most am too lazy to seach it myself so this is great app and quite even when working on mobile network i give it handy 4 out of 5,,,
2013,1,"Kept telling me no results. I tried a few different dates and airports, but no go. The site looks great, though!",,,
2013,5,I really adore this app! It provides me with all the possible flights for any destination with no-fuss booking. This will definitely come in handy for a long time!,,,

2013,5,Awesome app. Easy to use. Finds the best deals. Used it many times to find great deals on flights.,,,
2013,4,Nice. ..except for Branson (BKG) that's in Missouri. My parents live there. Skyscanner has it listed as Hollister California...but really that airport is in Hollister Missouri!,,,

2013,5,Everything I want out of skyscanner at my fingertips!!!,,,
2012,4,"Great app to find really great deals.  I could help my mom meet my wife's family for the first time because of this app.  It's not perfect, but I have very minor reasons.  Overall, worth downloading if you need affordable plane tickets.",,,
2012,5,Awesome app! Really efficient for finding good and cheap flights! Loving it!,,,
2012,4,Works great but would be nice if billing country changes automatically to current location. Now it's on US until changed manually and I had to find this out by accident. Also make the setting more prominent instead of hiding it so deep in the settings as it can have a huge effect on search results. Almost 5 stars.,,,
2012,5,"I owe this app big time. Had to schedule a flight to STL within a month, and this app got me the best price overall. By over a hundred dollars. Even after I researched all of the bargain sites and this was still the best deal. Extra points for the UI. I am so grateful for this app. It was a Godsend. Thanks guys!",,,
2012,4,"The app is really outstanding. It does what is supposed to do easily and fast. However, I give it only 4 stars since it doesn't have the option to save your search in order to be advised for different fares. Then it would be 5 stars...",,,
2012,1,"Why do you need to read my phone log ? I dont understand how app to compare flight needs access to some of the areas you ask. I think you best remain with having internet access and GPS location, rest is none of your business.  Uninstalled.",,,
2013,5,"Best app to search for your flight ever. Just type in the airport from which you wish to depart from and land, the options are many and you can select a specific day, week or just look through the whole month or year. U can also select only the country and it will tell u the best farr and what city according to the price and so on. Amazing!",,,
2012,5,"Excellent work. Your android dev team is worth its weight in gold. I woul like to suggest the following - loose the iPhone style rollers in the date picker. There are loads of android themed widgets. I know your designers are apple geeks, dont listen to them :)   Keep up the excellent work",,,
2013,4,Excellent app! Saves your searches so you can come back & check frequently for price changes. I found cheap tickets to Hawaii bc of this app. Only reason I give it 4 stars is bc my AVG alerted me this app has malware embedded in it.,,,
2012,2,Beware when the app gives you a different airline for your return journey. Especially for Barclelona return flights. It gave me Ryanair only to find out that Ryanair don t use Barcelona International but an airpirt 100 miles away. This meant booking my return flight elsewhere and i had to cut short my break.,,,
2012,5,"Only booked one flight through this app so far but will use again frequently! after much comparison and searching elsewhere, a friend told me about this app. It came up with the same flight that i had pinned down as the best deal, except instead of taking hours it took seconds! Came on to look up another flight and decided to rate it so others can share in my joy",,,
2012,2,"Very complete with one problem. They have to be charging a fee on the back end because the fares they find are ALL more expensive than ALL of the other popular travel apps ie: Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity, etc. Very good app otherwise. Just don't know why I would pay over $50 more for same flights.",,,
2012,3,Nice idea but the prices are always higher than showing when I try to book. When I tried to book the airfare Almost never had the same fare as it scaned. Price jumps about 20%. Can't search one way fare either.,,,
2012,3,The app doesn't offer the same flight search enzgine capacity as the online one. As well as the special deals and offers are missing from the app.  It is only useful for preliminary search if flights for users.,,,
2012,4,"Excellent comparison tool, it's fast and easy to analyze the information returned. However, you should not book through the app, the lowest priced results may be even lower through the actual airline's webpage.",,,
2012,4,"Good app, there could be some more improvements for updates. If the developers ever read these comments, add the option for a multi-stop flight. Also, it'd be great if the selection of airlines could be improved.",,,
2012,2,My first try at finding a flight and it's saying no results and that it could be a number of reasons (how vague). I know it's not connectivity since I have mobile and wifi signal. The flight is fine as I checked on Ryanair's website. Hmmm,,,
2012,4,"This really is one of the best applications I have even used for travel purposes. Interface is great, it's very convenient and lightweight. Room for improvement exist but good as is.",,,
2012,4,"Very good app., would give five stars if fares become more current  and up to date. Compared to other web based options could use some tweaking in getting fare information.",,,
2012,3,It is quite easy to use. Good for a fast ref. Then I start to realise not all airlines are in there. I am talking abt full fledged big airlines missing in the selections. If can improve it will be an even better app!!,,,
2012,5,"Top app. So much better than having to search website. Can just click an option to change flights, tines, dates, destinations whatever. Very helpful, especially when your dates are flexible.",,,
2012,3,Following points if incorporated will be good. 1. Saved results deletion option which updates the widget 2. Notification if there is a change in price on the saved query 3. Refresh the results with latest price if clicked on the refresh button on the widget,,,
2012,5,"Seriously impressive travel app, does exactly what you want and appears to find the best prices saving loads to time and frustration. Love the explore feature which us esp useful if you thinking of where to go.",,,
2012,5,"Haven't booked with it yet, though just from searches...it is quick, easy to use, I've already saved some favorite trips, it finds the best deals, better than my search engine on the computer! What more can I say....thanks for a great app.",,,
2012,5,Successfully found flights on indirect routes that were suitable for both time and price. Has made life so much easier at avoiding the likes of Byanair & Lazyjet. Thank you.,,,
2012,5,"This apps is prefect. in fact, very awesome. lot easier than going through each flight website to have a look. congrat to dev team. but i got one MINOR prob. the banner ads sometimes blocking the top buttons whenever im in landscape mode (nexus 7).how do you remove the ads? im willingly to pay for a pro versiom just to get rid of the ads banner. or dev team could just fix it. any way,, awesomee apps!",,,
2012,3,Well I noticed right away that's not all airlines are included in this app. even though in the title it says all flights. I would say this is misleading. so I gave it a 3 star,,,
2012,5,"I love this app! It just works so smoothly, finding the best price seamlessly. Easier than using the website I find. Kudos dev team",,,
2012,4,"There isn't much wrong with this app - the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because as yet I've not figured out how to search for date ranges. For specific dates and by month: yes, but for a shorter range like a week: no.",,,
2012,5,Exactly what i was looking for and i love the option of adding searches to favourites. Its smooth fast and shows me what i want. Im happy :),,,
2012,5,"I am travelling very much and absolutely prefer this App! Easy handling and best deals, since I still did cross-checks, but now I just rely on it.",,,
2012,5,The best app I have ever used! Thanks for allowing me to make my dreams come true in such an easy fashion! Fours years on the road (or should I say in the air?) and counting!,,,
2012,5,"Convenient, easy to use, attractive and helpful. This app is absolutely great. My husband and I do a lot of international travel and I am able to check on this app on a daily basis. A few times it hasn't had the lowest prices available but they always eventually show them. I Recommend this app to anyone who frequently flies.",,,
2012,5,Perfect. I have used sky scanner for years now and this mobile app is just as good as the desktop. Thanks guys! Keep up the great work.,,,
2012,5,Love the widget so much :-)  The new calendar works better too. Ty4 such a great update.,,,
2012,5,I have been able to use  the calendar function to get the best prices for China.  Can't do this with the PC version.  This application gave the best price and was easy to use.,,,
2012,5,Works well. The widget is fun too...would actually be useful if u could filter out results from Ryan Air!,,,
2012,4,"There are so many apps, when you get one that works first up, it is refreshing. Any time saver is a money maker...",,,
2012,4,prices seem to be a few dollars more than the average Orbitz or whatever... but comparable and not bad. I definitely like the app.,,,
2012,4,Good app! Best if you can include SGD currency too. Look forward to an update! Thanks,,,
2012,5,this is an amazing app. I tried a number of apps before it including Kayak and Expedia and none of them found flights for the low cost airline closest to me. this app found me so much more flights...cheaper flights...than those other apps. not to mention its just beautiful and simple to use. 5 stars without hesitation.,,,
2012,5,"ABSOLUTELY the VERY BEST application for finding flights with quick sorts for price, direct or one stop flights, duration of flight, take off times & return times. Start off with setting ideal dates. Then, with a simple click, one can switch scenes to a visual colorful bar chart to easily see cheapest available price as well as day to day price differences if you want to consider available savings on alternate dates. Only negative change is that app used to also show discounted airlines, but not recently.",,,
2012,1,"Used to work pretty good before, but now it does not find anywhere close to all available flights. The web version is way superior.",,,
2012,5,Fast n EZ to find good prices... Please don't add anything else to slow it down. Thank you.,,,
2012,3,"Good but prices for certain dates are not displayed so that is a bit annoying. If that is fixed, then can easily get 5 stars. Good app otherwise.",,,
2012,5,One of the greatest apps around. Used it on a three month vacation in Europe traveling to 8 countries and 13 cities. Saved me hundreds of Dollars. Hint: changing the billing country in settings may actually search certain web sites in that country and give you better or worse prices. Worth trying.,,,
2012,5,"Find it very useful as a hint to expected flight cost, but still would use airline's official site on pc for booking. Thanks for a handy tool!",,,
2012,4,"Certainly the features were satisfying. However, there are flights that can be filter in the website is not shown in the app. Improvement can be made.",,,
2012,4,thanks for adding scoot airlines in ur search! helps a lot more in price comparison across all cheaper airlines! appreciate that!!,,,
2012,5,The service and the accuracy in fares is excellent..i travel a lot so I have to keep checking the flight details regularly and this app made it very easy & comfortable for me..moreover its UI is also simple yet attractive n very user friendly.,,,
2012,5,"I don't usually review apps, life's too short, but this app is simply astounding. It gets prices for flights from all airlines and is especially useful for finding the hidden bargains on Ryanair and Easy jet. It will also give you prices for the whole year. I can't find any faults with it and I would even pay for this app and I never pay for apps.",,,
2012,5,"Great app... It works, 1st time I used it, saved more than double the cost of my usual tickets.  Good job!!!",,,
2012,4,"Clean UI, nice widget and seems quick, all in all very good app, would be 5 but as yet not sure if the widget is updating automatically before I click it",,,
2012,5,superb. I like the way this app works. makes searching lot more easier.  5stars for me.  worth downloading..,,,
2012,5,"Instalei o app e em menos de 5min eu ja tinha comprado minha passagem internacional por 50% a menos do preco que eu vinha acompanhando ha semanas. Um achado! Got an international flight ticket  for literally half of the normal price using this app, in less than 5min after the download. Simply awesome!!!",,,
2012,5,"I mean it just does what you'd expect it to do... which is unusual in an app, so hats off to them. Makes choosing flights a doddle. Shame you have to then use the ailine websites which are confused to say the least.",,,
2012,1,I book the tickets on this program and had problem with dates just cas its keep jumping between oct 2012 to dec 2012. Then the travel agent i book with is Chinese agent cant speak english . My suggestion is check the price and date and call the agent before you pay,,,
2012,4,"In my girlfriend's Android 2.2 there is an amazing widget, but in my android 4.1.2 it doesn't exist! Where is the widget for Jelly Beans OS? If you fix it I would give u 5 stars!",,,
2012,5,Very good app. Saves time and hassle of browsing the web. Good way to quickly compare options.,,,
2012,3,It doesn't give one the option of departing from one airport and returning to another(multi-airport). Please fix!,,,
2012,4,It's good but then checked for more than 01 pax the price shown and later when you confirm it says not available I think this should have shown on first page only. Overall excellent app,,,
2013,4,Four stars for its usefulness. There are some airlines that are not included in the search. Ill give five stars if the software updated to include them.,,,
2012,5,I'm not one for doing business on a smart phone but I must say this is probably the best app amongst others and so easy to negotiate!  THANK YOU!,,,

2012,3,Pretty good app which loads quickly and remembers your last search so you don't have to enter again if you are keeping an eye on prices. The prices quoted are cheap but not the cheapest when looking at another site.,,,

2012,4,Apenas poderia haver op√ß√£o para classes executiva e business.,,,
2012,5,It amazingly as useful as the original fabulous site!,,,
2012,5,"Save me so much time , wish to have more eastern Europe companies in the  database !!!",,,
2012,4,Since I have this app don't wanna change to anything,,,
2012,5,–û—á–µ–Ω—å –ø–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–µ –∏ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–º–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ! –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä—é –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤!,,,
2013,3,"Not a bad app, but it could be so much better. Prices are not updated often enough, so when I select a fare it's often not available. That means I have to load each day separately which defeats the purpose of the app, which is to save me time. It also means it's not a reliable tool to monitor flights over a period of time unless you have hours to spend on it. And still no open jaws? Other sites have had that feature for years! Check fares more often and add open jaws for more stars. Until then you leave yourselves open to someone else coming up with a better app.",,,
2012,4,"Skyscanner does it job accurately- it has consistently been my travel search companion for 2 years and the app has always provided me precise results, with crisper results than local travel agents. However, there is scope for improvement- A missed feature is ""Flexible date search"", where the app should list cheap fares in a range of dates. Probably app writers should take inspiration from website such as KLM, where return fares are provided on a 2D chart, plotting us the most economic fare in a different color for ease. If this option were there, it would make searches easier and I'd rate it 5-star :-D",,,
2012,4,"I don't like the way it says one price, then you click it and its higher, then click again to book and its higher still. I think airlines try to game or strongarm the system, probably not sky scanner itself.   A very useful tool, not least just for seeing the destinations quickly for each airport and drafting ideas.  Routing is sometimes wrong, missing or just plain led. Again, not sure if airlines are withholding info to try to game it. Must be difficult trying to get these companies to compete fairly.",,,
2013,1,"I'm sure this will get buried but here goes.  The graphics and interface are OK. accuracy and customer service ( what a joke)  are nonexistent (waited over a day for email response on time sensitive pricing)  Prices that say"" LIVE"" were hundreds of $$ different. Most just routed you to the Airline and in a couple cases the price was ove $500 different than the "" so called"" LIVE PRICE.",,,
2012,2,"I sort my flight by non stop, and it never shows anything unless I look at all flights.  You have options to tailor your search,  but u never actually get to use this feature bc it just won't let u see anything but all the flights.  Ugh. Doesnt show all airlines either..",,,
2012,3,"Concept is nice and I like how the interface shows you the lowest prices for days at a glance.  But when the glance price can vary as much as $100 or more from the actual search price on a typically $400 ticket, it ultimately becomes useless and a waste of time.  Kayak is safe for now.",,,
2012,1,"On Galaxy Tab with Gingerbread i get ""the page fault cannot be set. . ."" error. So cannot install on SD card! On several other attempts to launch app after eventual successful installation, it consistently crash! This is an appalling app. Uninstalling. . . Never to reinstall! ;(",,,
2012,4,"It is one of the better flight apps out there.  Most the time you don't have set dates, but this app tells you all the possible flights so you can find the cheapest flight.  I believe you have to go and order the flights by the airlines and some flights might not exist, but at least they give you all the options to find your flight",,,
2012,4,"I love this app!  This is extremely easy to use and is always updating flight fees so you have the most current information.  You can book your flight right from your phone.  It also does not hog your phone memory like the kayak app does.  this app does not give hotel or car rental information, otherwise I would have given it a prefect rating.",,,
2012,5,"Love this app - makes price comparisons for flight ticket prices so easy while on the go. The chart comparison UI is great to quickly explore different price options. Would be great if the functionality can support searching for packages, e.g. flights+car, flights+hotel, flights+car+hotel.",,,
2012,1,"Could be great little app, if didn't forget to include world's largest airline Delta	Their claim that you can compare all flights everywhere would be nice, BUT they forgot to include Delta Airlines, arguably the world's largest airline.  What's worse is that they don't tell you of their omission and I had to figure it out for myself. What a waste of time.",,,
2012,4,More user-friendly than similar apps. Doesn't always provide the cheapest options at times. Please compare with budget airlines websites that service the same route when selecting a flight.,,,
2012,4,The layout of product is perfect! Before using this app I had several travel search apps; I can now get rid of them.,,,
2012,5,"If your looking for the cheapest flight tickets you can find, you NEED to have this app!  Tried using KAYAK but its very slow and cumbersome on my phone, unlike this app- very FAST and SMOOTH app ***LOVE the graph comparison view!*** thank you for this AWESOME APP!!",,,
2012,5,As a long term user of the website this app is just as convenient for flight price comparison. Does what it says on the tin. Nothing annoying about it at all. Easy to use. Well done.,,,
2012,5,"I never leave reviews but had to for this app. Absolutely no problems, very user friendly. Loved the website, now love the app, perfect for checking flights on the go. Very happy. HTC One X.",,,
2012,4,"Still lacks the ability to input multiple airports at once - you only have the option to select ""nearby airports"" but not enter them manually as in the web version ... other than that great app and great flight search engine!",,,
2012,5,This is a quite useful app with fast results. It has my country and our national airways in the list - something hard to find in other apps. One feature I would love to have - ability to filter by airways company,,,
2012,2,"As with many other flight search apps, it's just good for single trip search and returns with no longer than a month from departure date. Useless for any return trip searches beyond that. Better results from Kayak app.",,,
2012,4,If you can give the prices in local currency and give use to choose currency it will be user friendly. Very interesting application. Gives details of all the flights on the move.,,,
2012,5,"The layout is great, it's easy to use, and I love the abundance of features (e.g. ability to pick ""everywhere"" as destination, or ""anytime""). Easier ordering from the app would be great, atm it just sends you to the airline's homepage, which is often not designed for phones.",,,
2012,5,"This app works beautifully and smoothly. Its easy to use, fast and accurate. Its so easy to use that I no longer find it necessary to look for air ticket prices on a computer anymore.",,,
2012,4,"I find this app. to be very useful. It gives you an overall review of prices, times and lenght of flights. I would change the way in which you input dates though, it seems a bit complicated. Other than that I use it quite a bit.",,,
2012,5,This app is perfect. Nice and polished and works well. Beats Tripadvisor hands down. Finds flights that are cheaper and have shorter stop over times! Very happy :),,,
2012,5,"Can I suggest a feature? Multiple destinations.. I've two airport in my area and everytime I've to look them separately, it would be great to see them together and choose to go in one and come back from the other.",,,
2012,3,Would rate 5 stars if the price displayed was the price I paid but its miles off.. Says my flight to germany will be 45 quid return but when booking they want 225!! Big difference,,,
2012,1,I am in the USA and I thought this app was great till today I bought a ticket I thought was $387. Then when I  buy it it say ¬£366. In my email. I look at my Bank statement today  turns out I paid $593. dollars. I am mad as hell. I feel lied to.,,,
2012,4,I've not actually booked anything through this app yet but it's been really good and easy in terms of searches and always comes up with the cheapest options it seems.,,,
2012,4,"This is a great app but just be warned before buying that you check the full website as well. We bought flights through the website that never showed up on the app, even when doing the identical searches. We saved ourselves 100¬£ per person that we wouldn't have via the app.",,,
2012,5,Great app. Almost the same functionality as in web version. The only thing that is nice to have is changing the depature/arrival day without returning back on the main screen,,,
2012,5,This app is perfect as it works as it should. I'm yet to purchase a flight through it but it seems to do the job of searching various flight costs just from my Samsung galaxy s3,,,
2012,4,This app is prefect for a busy traveler.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do. Scans the options and helps you book flights quickly and easily across many carriers.,,,
2012,5,"all i could have asked for.. very easy to use from the phone. saves previous/starred searches. various currencies. chooses my location as ""from"" field by default",,,
2012,4,Great app but needs a urrency interface as prices only display in pounds...not usefull in Africa or US where my last 2 flights were!,,,
2012,5,Can pick where your flying from and dates. App will show you flights to everywhere that are available. Perfect if your looking for a cheap city break. Love this app.,,,
2012,5,"I hope im not jumping the gun sending out 5 Stars now but I have other apps for this purpose and this is the first (so far) to deliver what it's promised. Easy app to work and transitions pretty smooth. So far, I am very happy.",,,
2012,5,Fantastic app. Very easy to use and very helpful in finding great savings on flights. Updates price changes very frequently.  :-D,,,
2012,1,"Software will not start in android, stating that i do not have enough memory internal or external when that's clearly not the case. I liked it before!",,,
2012,4,"Easy to use, tells me the cheapest flight to other countries and the flight timings.  Would be better if it included the new scoot airline.",,,
2012,5,"I love this app, it helps me find gd deals,since I fly a lot, it come very handy... truly recommend it. ;-) Enjoy",,,
2012,4,"It's perfect app and very fast. Except one thing, when I select any day for dparture or arrival says internet connection required, even that I have good connection. Fix please.",,,
2012,5,I've never reviewed an app before but was moved to do so by skyscanner. It's so user friendly. It far surpassed my expectations.,,,
2012,5,Really good in terms of flight searching. Best travel app I have used so far. Works fine on my phone too.,,,
2012,5,"Top app for frequent flyers or holidaymakers. Search all flights in an instant without the hassle of looking on all the different airline websites. Better still, search for indirect flights or use the anywhere function to sneak a cheeky stop-over into the itinery.",,,
2012,5,"...exactly what it's supposed to, great app. simple, intuitive UI and no unnecessary b.s. all that earned it 4 stars, the 5th came because it consistently finds cheaper flight options than any of the major travel sites (Priceline, Kayak, Expedia, etc)",,,
2012,4,"I've used this app only for short haul, but found it easy to work with, an excellent tool for the traveller. I use the main web site always.",,,
2012,3,The date selection should have been easier. Could be great if they used the monthly calendar view.,,,
2012,5,"Vey easy to use and extremely fast on GalaxayS2. The best detail is that you do not have to select the outbound or inbound dates. The scrolling calander is nice, showing you pricing per day. If your flexible this can save much money.",,,
2012,3,Had some cool features as in the search anywhere. But missing things like search day before or after. And no multi city.,,,
2012,5,"I tied so may flight finders but this one beats all the rest hands down. Easy to use, comprehensive and accurate. Kudos to the designers, developers.",,,
2012,5,Omg the best app... so easy and intuitive and great for browsing for the lowest price air travel anywhere. Choice of currencies and location info. It's a must for any air travel!,,,
2012,5,Brilliant to use and better than Web version.  Saved me both time and money...  Fab,,,
2012,5,Absolutely brilliant. Love the feature to see the costs for days prior and after your original date do you can tweak your holiday to get the cheapest flight!,,,
2012,5,Great app! Everything works as it should and I love how it lists all airlines... U get to pick the rate fasterr,,,
2012,4,"I really like this app, it allies me to very quickly obtain accurate and useful travel information showing all of the options available.",,,
2012,5,I just love it! It's so great to have an app where you can compare the whole year prices and you dont jave to search by exact.dates! Altho sometimes it doesn't show some dates' price don't know why but i still love it!,,,
2012,4,Yeh very decent  app!!!!! would be nice too see hotels combined then its a all in 1 travel companion..... Thanks,,,
2012,5,Great app  especially because you can search country to country to find cheapest routes or hubs. Would be good if they could also list prices for flights with one stop. Love this app.,,,
2012,5,"I love this website, and the app makes it really easy to use right from phone. I just wish it was easier to order straight from search.",,,
2012,4,"Look and feel are great, good to see the price graph feature is included as well. Saves your last searches which is handy.",,,
2012,5,Love this app!  Great for flight updates when traveling or meeting someone at the airport.  No surprises on delayed flights.,,,
2012,2,Results never match actual prices when you search. Feels like bait and switch.,,,
2012,5,Booked two holidays off of it so far an amazing app that works every time. Couldn't recommend it more after it was recommended to me,,,
2012,1,"Gives you a price once you click on it, price dramatically changes except on major routes which anyone can find directly. Contacted Skyscanner for explanation and they refuse to comment",,,
2012,5,Sky Scanner is reliable Ave bit just limited to destinations in the US like other travel sites. The GUI is smooth responsive and fast.!,,,
2012,5,I'm planning an 8 month term around SE Asia and this app is the most useful flight finding app out there.   It gives quick results.,,,
2012,4,Gives you more choices than other apps and allows one to select more destinations in case your destination and or source is in close proximity to multiple airports...awesome app. Can now book an affordable flight on the fly.,,,
2012,4,Great app for finding budget aurline flights with the added ability to search for flights to the whole country and not have to specify a specific airport! Not the most ideal for long haul flights however.,,,
2012,4,Great app. Displays the info you want to see when comparing flights. Any chance of adding in flights via a destination or loop trips?,,,
2012,5,Can't fault this app. Makes finding the cheap flights really easy and is very visual and clear.,,,
2012,5,I don't even fly that much but this is a great app and fun to just imagine going to some great places. Thank you for making a great travel app.,,,
2012,5,"I love skyscanner. Very recently searched and booked flights from Manila, Philippines to Bali, Indonesia thru here and I did it with no trouble whatsoever! Good job u guys!",,,
2012,4,the price is uptodate. but there are some price in the grafic that are not available.  Should fix it. showing the price not directly book. Must have apps for ppl who travel a lot.,,,
2012,5,Works brilliant. Really helped with booking my next holiday... Keep it up,,,
2012,5,I think this a fantastic app. Always used the web site for several years prior to the app as my first choice for flight search engines. Recommend it to all my friends.,,,
2012,4,"Great for both last minute trips and planning a vacation. I docked a star, though, because sometimes it will show a low price that doubles or triples when you go to book, but this might be airlines, not the app",,,
2012,5,What a great app. Have been looking for a site to finf me flights from any airport in the UK to my favorite destinations and skyscanner does just that. Saved about 40-50%! Their website as also brilliant!!!,,,
2012,5,"Checks all the cheap airlines as well as the normal ones. Looks at combinations of airlines and gives a chart that shows the costs on various days around your chosen dates, again for all airlines. Makes looking for flights very easy. Great App",,,
2012,5,Instead of dreaming to go to destinations  I can see whats affordable when! Love the app but dont think  I can keep it my little secret for much longer =),,,
2012,5,"This app is fantastic, goes through all the major airlines and other booking websites to get really good deals. Perfect for the frequent flyer",,,
2012,5,"Easy to use, does what it says on the tin. Date picker could be easier to use, but hey it works well as is.",,,
2012,5,finds the bessst deals just about every single time n I use it almost weekly!  Great app for finding flights! :),,,
2012,2,"It doesn't give you the option to choose the travel class e.g. economy, business, or first class. All other options are excellent, I have given 2 stars because I am a business first frequent traveller",,,
2012,4,Work well and usefull but note enough low cost companies and prices are often not accurate,,,
2012,5,"This app is extremely slick to use. My first port of call for all flight searches from now on. Being able to pick a destination, then ask it to search all UK airports is a real time saver.",,,
2012,5,I just bought a ticket before I got that app. And day later I've found 200$ cheaper ticket. Though it was for me it might be good time and chance for you.,,,
2012,5,Awesome app! I hardly ever rate apps. But I spent a ton of time shopping around online trying to find the best price. And after my first attempt at using this app I found the best price!,,,
2012,5,Works v.well. Only a small number of airlines dont work properly.,,,
2012,3,If only u can let us change the currencies to our liking it will be great!! Other than that...this app is brilliant,,,
2012,5,Great app! Compares several different flight options and lets you choose the most suitable depending on your requirements.,,,
2012,5,So far doing a great job. Especially love the price chart. I think it would be better to allow flexible search and also go send out alert when price is lower than certain value. Thx.,,,
2013,5,"An excellent app to compare the prices, really neat UI, would definitely recommend to others. Cheers to the devs..!!",,,
2012,5,"Love the comparison chart, let's you look at prices so easily. Love the fact you can choose ""everywhere"" for your destination and it'll come up with a variety of cities and prices. Nicely designed.",,,
2012,5,"If you are open to being flexible to where you vacation to this app is for you.  Just pick a deporting airport(s) and ""everywhere"" for arriving airports and it doesn't hurt to be a little flexible with you dates too.  And you'll save tons of money.",,,
2012,5,a good start for searching flights... but sometimes it's cheaper to search thru the airline websites... but like I said... this app will give you the clue which airline to start,,,
2012,5,I wasn't able to buy the ticket but it is the best flight search I've seen. After finding the flight I guess I'd have to go to the airline page and book. But I just need average prices por Weeks and got it.,,,
2012,5,Conveniently helps reduce my ticket price with non-direct flight feature! This apps deserve to be reserved in my phone forever!,,,
2012,5,This is a great little app! Its really useful for comparing flights over different days to find the lowest fares.,,,
2012,5,But this simplifies the bazillion options of booking a holiday. 5 stars very well earned...,,,
2012,5,"This is a very good app. Works great,  gives different flights &  cost on different airlines.  Love it.",,,
2012,5,"Serves it's purpose very well. Convenient interface, good functionality, no problems",,,
2012,4,Just what I've been looking for.  Searches all major airlines and combines them to find best price and least amount of flight time.,,,
2012,5,"Great app Simple to use, user friendly  and very fast with a big choice of flights. Top notch.",,,
2012,5,Works great on the S2. An option to check for multi city bookings would make it perfect.,,,
2012,4,A very good tool for small national airlines as some other flight finders only deal with multi-nationals,,,
2012,1,Money grubbers.  I would simply like to track flights sometimes too.  You know.,,,
2012,5,This app works well. I use it to find cheap flights and check it often to narrow down on the best value flight.,,,
2012,5,Everything is running smoothly. A lot of search options. Helpful tool,,,
2012,4,I have used the skyscanner main website before so was pleased to see an app. Not gone all the way though booking yet but is good for price comparison.,,,
2012,5,Works great!! Hot app if u travel a lot and need to find the best connectio.s tickets etc,,,
2012,1,You are better off searching the internet it comes up with prices like ¬£162 per person and when you click on price it goes up to nearly ¬£500 for two people. Do the maths!!!!,,,
2012,5,Wish I would have known about this sooner. Great find for anyone looking to find great deals on air fare!,,,
2012,1,"If the app is to be supported all the price relevant regular airlines must be included. Sorry, no go!",,,
2012,3,"Not many options, doesn't show up many flights but can find some good deals",,,
2012,4,"Great flight search app. Would be improved if the any time search had less out-of-date results, and multi-city search was available.",,,
2012,5,One of the best apps I have seen so far. Works great and the UI is perfect!,,,
2012,4,"If like travelling, you'd better have this app, since you'll know the best fares right away. That's it!",,,
2012,3,"Generally it is a good app, but I end up checking the skyscanner website anyway,  because last time not all the prices were shown in the app, there was 25% cheaper flight on the site",,,
2012,5,This is wow.. I have been using this for ages.. I managed to get cheap flight easily through this application. Keep the good work!!,,,
2012,3,Haven't booked a flight with the app but the pricing that it found was pretty good.  Only down side is that it doesn't support multicity searches.,,,
2012,2,Good setup for all flights but the prices they have on there is way under what it is by the time you go to the online site...it would be great to book on here with those prices but you cant so there is no point to it,,,
2012,4,Like it. Makes it abit easier. Alot of flights & accommodation r in one place eventho sometimes the price r a bit wavering :/ but good.,,,
2012,5,This is a great app!! It is fast and I can  Check all airports In the area. Thanks,,,
2012,5,Its my go to app for finding airfares at the best price. Very functional with lots of info to make travel decisions.,,,
2012,5,"Could use a few UI and user friendly updates, but other then that? Perfect little app.",,,
2012,2,Only searches a small selection of airlines. (E.g. Southwest not included.) Definitely not all inclusive.,,,
2012,1,"No good. Can only be istalled for one day, then app says I have insufficient internal memory. Un-installing",,,
2012,5,Great app. Well written. very clear and intuitive interface,,,
2012,4,Not bad. But there cheaper deals you can find in other web sits,,,

2012,5,Really appreciates for who design this application. It helps me save plenty time to look for cheap air ticket.,,,
2012,5,"Wouldn't pay for flights off the app, but by doing the search it can put itself ahead of the competition by showing everything the site does. Great app easy to use.",,,
2012,4,I always use this App first before using anything else. Easy to use. Fast and reliable with no annoying ads.,,,
2012,4,pls add the feature of +/- 3 days in search options for flights and also multi round trip options,,,
2012,4,Makes Kayak etc look like a bunch of amateurs. Only improvement would be to be able to search prices for unaccompanied children,,,
2012,5,Lots of features and easy to find flights. Great app.,,,
2012,4,Makes checking for flight timings and prices really easy ... and it remebers your most frequent searches so no need to enter it over and over again !!!,,,

2012,5,Five star app. Works better than every other flight search engine.,,,
2012,5,"I love the website and use it all the time so having Skycanner as an ap makes it even better. Still really easy to use and give a good idea of routes, times and dates available.",,,
2012,5,"This Skyscanner Ap has been invaluable while planning a 3-month USA & Canada trip. I find it easy to use, fast & love the graphics too",,,
2012,5,"Will find flights to anywhere in the world with prices, flights times, flight duration and how many stops. Great for regular travellers.",,,
2012,1,Says that includes low cost and budget airlines! NOT TRUE! It includes only typical common airlines...,,,
2012,5,I just love this app. User friendly and has been a long time fave of mine.,,,
2012,5,They say sliced is great well try this out cos it makes sliced bread look old & stale. Using SKYSCANNER is using a slice of good luck,,,
2012,4,Could give 5 stars if it included more airlines too.  But great app overall.,,,
2012,4,Overall very good. Gets confused when using any day departure in a given month. Well worth having though .,,,

2012,5,Fast and all the functions of the full website. Works better than normal site on a mobile,,,
2012,5,"The ability to brie a day, price graph makes using this app significantly better than searching on their site. Very good.",,,
2012,3,It tells you one price and then bumps it up by about ¬£200 once you try to book. it is a bit misleading.,,,
2012,5,Correct about 90% of the time though it can miss out one or two airlines depending on destination. Still a must have for travel apps collection.,,,
2012,4,"Very quick and well put together but doesn't have multiple destination option, therefore it is useless to me.",,,
2012,4,Easy to use.like the recent searches feature. Good download.,,,

2012,3,"I'll give you five stars if you can make currency other than sterling as the currency is poundsterling, because I live in Indonesia",,,
2012,3,From other apps plus this one is a bit clumsy. Too many touches required to do a simple search,,,

2012,1,loved it was my favorite apparently now I freaking HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,
2012,5,Really easy to use. The filters are helpful and user friendly. Managed to check a serious number of flights for two people travelling from two different parts of the world. Job done in no time and didn't have a headache by the end of it :-),,,
2012,5,Found deals i couldn't find online! amazing functionality. Now its the only airline ticket app I'll probably use.,,,
2012,4,Would give 5 star if this would really search all airlines. By coincidence I found out that Silkair is actually missing and they happened to offer the best connection on my route. Now wondering which other airlines it leaves out and why!,,,
2012,5,"One of the best apps I've seen. Fast, user friendly and ver efficient. Works great for Europe and low cost flights.",,,
2012,5,"Excellent App. to check flights and flight times. Have not booked yet but may do in future. If youre planning your next trip then this is a ""must have"" app.",,,
2012,5,"This is the easiest, quickest app to use to find the best fares.  Shows rate changes faster than the actual airline websites so you get an early jump on the lowest prices! Won't use another app again for flight prices!",,,
2012,5,Superb app.. Have never rated any before but this is fantastic .so simple to use and gives option to book direct,,,
2012,5,It is very easy to use. Detailed info provided. Many options are available. Great app. Thank you.,,,
2012,4,"Great app but can't purchase directly, still have to go to airline website and input information all over again. Good app if you just want to compare prices.",,,
2012,5,Returns the cheapest prices of one way or round flights. Multi city option is not available though.,,,
2012,5,All travel websites should take a cue from this app. Awesome interface to find the right flights.,,,
2012,5,Very easy to manipulate. Very versatile. Comes up with a lot of options.,,,
2012,5,Great app so easy to use and usually spot on with the best deals! I use it weekly and wouldn't be without it!,,,

2012,4,Really useful app. Especially when needing flights for flights back to the UK in a rush.	Brilliant,,,
2012,5,Great job. This app is flawless on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus,,,
2012,5,Searching for flights with different airlines used to be a pain until I found skyscanner. It even copies with Ryanair changes to try and stop 3rd party site searches,,,
2012,2,There is no way to do a one way search. Bad mistake.,,,
2012,4,Good but month long search doesn't seem to work real well when researching international destinations.,,,
2012,5,I regulary fly down to Norwich from Manchester. This app shows me the best prices and times to fly. Fantastic app!,,,
2012,5,I use it frequently for checking the best options for travel.,,,
2012,5,User friendly and with awesomely goos search. A must have for every traveler.,,,
2012,3,"Great app., but if you want a one-way flight, well, you're out of luck",,,
2012,5,Very useful application. There's nothing can be compared to it..,,,
2012,5,I used scanner to book a flight then went on to the hotel part a nd found a cheap hotel. One of the best apps have seen,,,
2012,5,Easy to use. Reliable. Accurate. Great to check prices on the go.,,,
2012,4,Fast and good results. Only thing missing is multiple cities...,,,
2012,3,great app but cheap flights never come up when you click on them Like they used too,,,
2012,5,Used this loads for work. I travel a lot and for finding routes to odd destinations from even more bizarre points of departure its invaluable,,,
2012,4,I have used this app a number of times and compared it with internet prices and found this to be very competitive and useful.,,,
2012,4,good looking and ergonomic use...love to install this apps on my cellphone,,,
2012,4,But it would be much more convenient if the calendar had grid view.,,,
2012,5,"I live in indonesia, almost all of the local Airlines Can be search from this apps also.. Very usefull",,,
2012,5,"Very useful, easy to access and will save you time and money. Strongly recommend.",,,
2012,5,Excellent app. Well thought out and brilliantly customisable,,,

2012,5,"Really simple, fast &effective. Saved me hundreds on flights",,,
2012,5,I really don't know what I'd do without skyscanner...,,,
2012,5,Excellent app. Better than implementation on big kit.,,,
2012,5,I will use this app first when searching for flights...,,,
2012,4,"Buat cari jadwal pesawat., walau belum semua maskapai. Tapi bolehlah..",,,
2012,5,Absolutely great ... No more tedious ways of looking things up 1day at a time ...,,,
2012,5,Very nice UI. gives accurate info.well thought of..,,,
2012,5,Its great but i hope that they can add seat classes,,,
2012,5,Perfect app! Even easier in use than on the computer,,,
2012,3,"Need to add two things in the setting option. 1) ability to choose military time or standard time. 2) change the calendar view. Those are the only items that prevent the app from being perfect. I will check back for updates...if there is none, I'll have to uninstall. Thanks",,,
2012,1,My searches display results with stops having long layovers even though my filters are properly set.   Seems this app wants to sell flights with the worst connections.  In all instances I went on an airline's website and found nonstop flights FOR LESS than results on this app.  Wonder if the app designers make their $$$ off of selling flights for airlines that no one would typically purchase.  Safe travels everyone.,,,
2012,4,Great starting point to give you an idea of what's available and basic price to be expected. It is a pity that there is no way to discriminate the lower end cheap travel agents that always come up best on cheap flights! After careful checking of a company.I almost booked with I found out so many people had had huge problems with them! That isn't the fault of the program though and I don't know how it would work out the cowboys from the decent reputable travel agents unless there was a rating system?,,,
2012,3,"Not sure how to make this work. The pictures in Market/Play show the app displaying prices for all dates in the calendar. Mine won't display more than three days. I find the ITA app and the Kayak app fairly easy, but this one isn't very intuitive.",,,
2012,1,"But the price results shown are not available on the next step. And this happens every time I look for a flight. The price calendar works, shows prices, but on the next step after select the travel date that price has gone, no available.",,,
2012,1,"Only allowed me to see monthly chart data. No pricing, no dates times or enter button Easier to just use the site Waste of my time and works so well on my phone. Pity.",,,
2012,5,This app is simply the best - makes you wonder why no one else has done it before - instantly see every country your nearest airports fly to within your dates. Absolutely brilliant - this is the future.,,,
2012,4,"Cool app, lets you view schedules and determine dates for travel based on graphing vs. tabled or other style listed booking rates.  But not much good if you have hard dates for travelling...",,,
2012,3,"Looks like a good app, but having difficulty with the selected date going into the  departure field. It always reverts back to the default date (current), or only the options that are already in the screen.",,,
2012,1,"App is brill, apart from having to re-install every few weeks as get the 'force close' error upon opening. Pls fix. HTC Desire HD",,,
2012,1,"They do have the cheapest flights and if you are going to buy a ticket and you know you're not going to have any delays then go for it...as for me I was on the way to the airport and the bus that was taking me got into a accident, I lost my flight and this agency wasn't able to help me out, in fact it was no body to talk to and the only person that was able to make any changes on my ticket was a lady from California and the only way she can get in touch with me is via e-mail...it was horrible.",,,
2012,5,So simple and easy to use. Finds the cheapest flights. Particularly enjoy the option of being able to choose your destination as 'everywhere'.,,,
2012,4,The only missing feature is multidestination. Other than that no problems. I would also suggest flight lookup from everywhere to specific destination.,,,
2012,2,"Didn't work via 3G, only via wifi connection. And research by day disconcerting as you have to tap Any Day to see a month view rather than being able to enter a precise date you wanted.",,,
2012,4,You can search for a specific flight or scan months to see the cheapest days to fly.  Prices are always updated.  Pretty great app for those wanting to a buck or two hundred!,,,
2012,4,"Great app, so useful. Only negative is sometimes it tells me the price for one (when it is higher for more than one ticket when you look on the airline's website!)",,,
2012,5,"Better than searching for flights than most travel sites. Easy interface for checking flight prices, for all airlines, before and after your expected travel date.",,,
2012,2,"In the first search the prices showned are ones and then when we touch to see more details of the prices, the prices are 100 or 200 euros higher!!! Also, when trying to book a flight, the outside links normally don't work",,,
2012,5,"This is the most comprehensive, easy to use air fare app I've come across.  It found me a roundtrip flight from Newark to Fort Lauderdale for $175. You can't beat that!",,,
2012,3,"I prefer the mobile website because although sky scanner is fantastic due to it's open ended searching the app way of accessing it is a bit basic - requests location permission but doesn't use it, 8mb seems bloated",,,
2012,5,i love this app! makes me want to travel more :D i can plan my tours ahead of time or change my mind to the last minute! very helpful:-),,,
2012,5,"Great app! I use it every time I need to fly somewhere and compare the prices. Been a long fan of the desktop website, but this is much better",,,
2012,1,"Every serach I put in it says no results found!! Waste of my time, help me or fix problem!!",,,
2012,4,What a great application. Cos it's all country flight schedule was in here. Thanks.,,,
2012,5,I am always looking for airfare deals and skyskanner lets me search quickly and efficiently while on the go!,,,
2012,2,"Can only select any day,then have to scroll all the way through to find exact dates required.",,,
2012,1,The date wheel doesn't do anything. Can't choose dates so the app is useless. DROID bionic,,,
2012,3,Only good for a rough idea. I find cheaper and less time consuming deals online or with my travel agent,,,
2012,5,"Very easy to use, fast loading, doesn't freeze. All information current and easy to understand. Lets you play about with dates easily",,,
2012,5,"Beautiful app, so easy to use. Developers should be proud!",,,
2012,1,"This app managed to find me a ticket for around 1500$ cheapest, and at the local agency, they found me one which costed 500‚Ç¨.",,,
2012,4,"Nice app. Needs a better help/tutorial, but once you get into using it it's really usefull.",,,
2012,5,Very usefull apps.i love the 'everywhere' and 'any day' option very much. :),,,
2012,4,Works perfect. I would however like to see hotels and holidays search as well.,,,
2012,5,Great quick way to check flight prices. One easy click to check other dates too. Glad I got this app!,,,
2013,5,It really does what it says. Highly recommended if want to track a lot of flight's. To know prices and departures times.,,,
2012,1,Filters don't work & no option for multiple flights. Uninstalled,,,
2012,3,Not showing cheapest prices. Whats the point. For example Expedia has been cheaper,,,
2012,5,Love it! Always a quick sure fire way to see flight prices!,,,
2012,5,This is the best app ever! Will never book a flight without checking here first! Definite money saver!,,,
2012,5,Very convenient to purchase from the app and very cheap tickets. Tickets go quick so keep checking back. Best flight app ever,,,
2012,5,Never looked anywhere else to find and book flights. Simply the best travel app I've used. Wicked!!!,,,
2012,5,Before I book any flight I start with this application...,,,
2012,1,I bought a ticket on through this and to my destination but what I was to return home they said the flight has been cancelled  and only one way was Paid for when the money wad taken out of my account,,,
2012,5,"Fast, efficient and awesome.  Forget all other travel sites.  Just use this!",,,
2012,2,I haven't been able to find one real ticket that marchese the process shown here.,,,
2012,5,Excellent. No problems or complaints at all. Recommended.,,,
2012,1,Good app but when I check the website I am getting cheaper prices. Thought they would both be the same,,,
2012,4,its very handy but i do miss the function for being flexible and finding a cheaper alternative.,,,
2012,5,"Saves me time and money! I ALWAYS use this app, I don't have to go to multiple websites and this has promos and budget airlines included!",,,
2012,4,Brilliant app!!  Very easy to use and quick to find flights availability,,,
2012,4,useful app.. but it needs to clarify some airways logo,,,
2012,5,Great app if you're planning a trip. I saved over $100 using this app and buying at the right time.,,,
2012,4,Really like the lay out but it could stand to be a little more user friendly,,,
2012,1,Does not allow you to enter custom dates on HTC one x.,,,
2012,5,Quick And easy. As advertised. Searches everything.,,,
2012,2,Internet search found lower fares then the app -- why,,,
2012,5,Usually finds the cheapest flights. Checks an incredible rage of sites.,,,
2012,4,Great app but greatly in need of the use of AM and PM,,,
2012,5,"So good, so nicely done. Way better than Web Jet in Australia.",,,
2012,4,"It works great, although I was a little confused about how to use it at first",,,
2012,4,Will it could also handle multiple location flights.,,,
2012,5,"fantastic app, the best I've used. makes searching flights extremely easy",,,
2012,1,try to pick a departure date other than today  --- good luck,,,
2012,5,Helpful program.. You can search and book flight on shorg time!,,,

2012,5,"Can't fault it once you get used to hittin back instead of ok, great app",,,
2012,5,This app is so easy to use and is a great way to find cheap flights.,,,
2012,5,Skyscanner is excellent. A brilliant app to complement the website whilst you're out and about..,,,
2012,1,"No tickets for the number of passengers selected. It says this every flight I press, there is only 1 traveller",,,
2012,2,"Dates don't work other than ""today"" or ""next day""....useless really.",,,
2012,5,Definitely found me the cheapest fare in comparison to other sites online. Thanx!,,,
2012,4,This app is great helped me out a lot with my airline tickets.,,,
2012,5,Best app ever. Saves me many hours with price comparation,,,
2012,5,This  is a great App. It helps finding the best flights for where you are going.  :-),,,
2012,4,"I travel a lot standby, so great for last minute changes",,,
2012,5,"Best flight search engine by far. Don't waste your time on KAYAK or Hipmunk, this is THE search engine.",,,
2012,1,The Search function doesn't work on the Transformer Prime!,,,
2012,5,Great app for finding the cheapest fairs and the chart option makes finding the cheapest day easy currency rates not perfect but not a real issue,,,
2012,5,"Easy to use app., super helpful! I use it to look up trips for myself, family & friends.",,,

2012,5,Works wonderfully have experienced very few problems,,,
2012,5,Excellent app gives you the right information you need for any flight.,,,

2012,5,"I have yet to buy a ticket from them, but it works fast and has a simple and on the go environment",,,
2012,5,"This app is quite awesome, a must for the regular traveller.",,,
2012,5,Handy daily checking of desired flights with one click as saves search :),,,

2012,5,Good app with quick results best part is choosing filters,,,
2012,5,It helps me book flight like anywhere everywhere...,,,
2012,5,This app is a life saver for aby seasoned traveller,,,
2012,5,"Does what you want, when you want it. Can't really ask for more.",,,
2012,4,"Very useful app for searching cheapest flights worldwide. Allows searching all flights with not only a flexible date but also a flexible destination. Adding a map, route planner and route lengths in km would make it ultimately perfect for me.",,,
2012,3,So here is the thing... why make an app for a website if it doesn't offer the same features. Big issue here is you can't break the flight by departure and arrival in separate pricing and times.,,,
2012,5,"Very user friendly. Accurate. The different search options (such as all flights in a certain month, or flights to any airport in a particular country) are very useful. I highly recommend this app. Works great on galaxy s2",,,
2012,2,Only lets you choose travel for upcoming week. Calendar lets you scroll to dates way in the future but you can't select them.  You are limited to next six days.,,,
2012,4,This is a very good app with an excellent layout. Perfect for quickly checking fares.  Wonder why multi city search option is not provided.,,,
2012,1,Stuck on February. Can't change month/date. Tried reloading. No difference.  Time to uninstall.  Maybe later.,,,
2012,1,"It gives you bad rates, I got a much cheaper deal by just looking at the Internet. It also keeps running in memory despite on being killed.",,,
2012,5,"I've found it best to find your flight, then go to the airline's website to check if you can get a better price - very often you'll save something. Beware that cheapest is not necessarily the best (in terms of quality of the trip - I personally hate spending 2 days on a trip, sleeping on the floor of transfer lounges, hidden expenses, etc. To try and save a few $.",,,
2012,5,Custom filters that allow you to keep your search quite broad initially to find lowest price flight and then refine search. Can't fault it.,,,
2012,4,"Searching for ""Any"" day in a month doesn't respect the airline filters I have set. If not for that would give it 5 stars.",,,
2012,3,Was working fine until the most recent update...froze the calendar...pick your own date option is no longet working..,,,
2012,2,Downloaded because I want to plan the summer? Nice layout but only let's you select ates in the upcoming week...,,,
2012,5,If they could add multiple stops in travel trip for ppl who want to travel different places or from one trip to another in different time.. such as- pdx to London for 2 weeks then London to Russia after 2 weeks then back from Russia to pdx.. my point is going from point A to B for sometime the point B to point C for sometimes then from point C back to A. Like a round trip but from different place of entry..,,,
2012,1,Useless on.android. Cant edit dates. Pretty basic requirement for travel planning not functioning,,,
2012,5,"I can put in a point of origin and ""Everywhere"" as the destination AND search an entire month.  This gives me the opportunity to book a fare when I don't really care where I'm going.  Awesome!",,,
2012,5,"I am truly amazed at the quality of this application. Found flight s not listed by the Big air search engines, saving me literally hundreds! A+",,,
2012,2,Never shows the right price anymore ....... Used to be the best flight planner site..... Please fix...... Back to cheap tickets site for now ...... When working its a 5 star app,,,
2012,5,Great app! Things become easier and more efficient! Thanks!,,,
2012,3,"Good application,need little improvement to be perfect. It is very difficult to set days",,,
2012,5,I recently missed a flight and was told my inflexible ticket meant I needed to pay ¬£400 for the next flight. This app saved me ¬£250 in 2 minutes flat!,,,
2012,5,Fare is shown in all currencies including Indian Rupees.I have just seen it and modified to Indian Rupees.Very very useful and user friendly.ThanQ for giving this great application for free.,,,
2012,3,Good app - once you figure out that you need to use back to select the date you've scrolled to. Not intuitive,,,
2012,5,"the most flexible air travel search system, lets you specify geographic areas (countries, continents, etc) rather than just cities",,,
2012,5,Really good app.Did show all the options for my search!,,,

2011,4,Simple to use. Great app. Only one small suggestion. A date range feature could make this even better.,,,
2011,3,"I like that they now have the Everywhere option, but search is painfully slow. Doesn't make sense that phone search is slower than web.",,,
2011,3,"Ok app, can't look up airport codes so you need to know them, haven't actually purchased a flight thru it yet. Prices almost seem to good to be right",,,
2011,5,Easy to use. Has a smooth interface. very complete app. It also includes low cost airlines.,,,

2011,5,"Awesome! Very impressed... easy to use, find flights in under 1 minute, love it!",,,
2011,5,Perfectly easy to use. This software not only lets you find the next flight but also allows booking it right away.,,,
2011,4,"Hi, I have been waiting for this app for so long on Android, it was amazing on iTouch, and this is exactly the same. Just why take so long?",,,
2011,1,Good app but VERY crappy UI for date selection! Where do you select the date? Should be obviously painless,,,
2011,5,This app has helped save me hundreds of dollars! It works great for Canada as it checks all sites.,,,
2011,5,One of the best app i used.. So simple to use.. So feature rich.. Skyscanner probably the best.,,,

2011,5,Top app This is awesome. Gets u flight details & rates for anywhere in seconds. Great job.,,,
2011,4,Would give 5 if it provided different classes. Overall very good.,,,
2011,3,Nice app but doesn't show smaller airlines like Aligiant Air:(,,,
2011,1,Latest version seems to max out storage in seconds for no apparent reason,,,
2011,4,"Good for on the go checking of flights, happy with the upgrade saving phone memory.",,,
2011,4,Some pages are non intuitive but apart from it everything ig great.,,,

2011,5,Fantastic and saves me hours looking for business flights and connections,,,
2011,5,"Amazingly easy to use, yet extremely helpful and practical.",,,
2011,1,"This is well written app, importunately flight search result costs are ridiculous. I-d say x2-x4 times higher then you'd get with a google search.  I got about -1000$ difference on Cheapoair. This app doesn't have all the deals in, they seem to have contracted with most expensive flights. not worth my 7mb of space.  /uninstall",,,
2011,2,"I expected more after all the great ratings.  There are a number of airlines not included in the search results, and I could find better ticket prices doing a search online.  I suppose if you are in a jam and all you have is your phone, this would be great.  If you are a savvy shopper, there are better deals to be found outside this app.  ~Samsung Infuse 4G",,,
2011,5,"I gave this 5 stars based on the superb UI, even though it lacks one feature I would like to have included, that is an open-jaw round trip search (fly to one city and return from another). That is a minor quibble.  The app is a joy to use, with very intuitive and easy to make selections.  The designers deserve kudos, especially since it is a free app. It also nicely accommodates tablets, in landscape or portrait modes.",,,
2011,4,"I've found it really useful, and I really like how it lets you select any UK airport to help find the cheapest flight. You could however update the date select screen as its a bit clumsy to have to select and then hit back. Also, works well on Honeycomb",,,
2011,5,Very fluid UI and it is easy to use. Displays a very detailed overview on flight details and costs for a long period or a very specific time frame. Above all else the ease of use tops the rating chart in my opinion.,,,
2011,5,This makes loooking for cheap tickets incredibly easy. There's a calendar chart where you can see what days are cheapest to fly are. A must have app!,,,
2011,2,"Potential, but atm useless, as craige said earlier...  Can't check future depart times.  I'll keep it installed and await updates.",,,
2011,2,App is great. Too bad you can book a darn thing. Links with getaway air thats only open m-f. Thanks but no thanks. Uninstalled.,,,
2011,2,"Cannot plan more than 2 months into the future. Although direct routes is not selected, it cannot show different options to complete a full route.",,,
2011,4,Its good but it dosen't give business class option. If dose how I don't know. But any way it's very helpful.,,,
2011,4,Extremely well designed interface. Very simple to use. Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because I'm not able to clear my 'Recent Search' list.,,,
2011,4,Looks up flights and prices nicely...quickly.   Add the option to switch different day quickly a day back or forth and you get 5 stars.,,,
2011,1,"Previous version worked fine, this one's UI is frustrating. Once I play the slot machine to.tediously select a date, I can't pull that date back!",,,
2011,3,"Skyscanner does provide an easy and accurate way to track flights from your phone, but some of the information is incomplete.  Not all flights present",,,
2011,3,App is good as android app. But the flight price is not cheap. If you run the same query on some other comparison web sites like travelsupermarket,,,
2011,5,"This is the best app on my phone! Fast and very good,very useful. No need to search individual airlines, this app does it for you in seconds.",,,
2011,5,Great app! Very smooth and intuitive interface and easy to use. Looking forward to when hotels and rental cars get added to this app...,,,
2011,5,"For my requirements, finds all flights expected plus some new options. Quick and easy, saves hours trying to find the right flight.",,,
2011,5,Love this app!! So easy to use. And some of the best rates feature. If youre a regular abroad its a must have!!,,,
2011,4,"Powerful search tool, efficient layout, easy to use. A little disappointed I was sent to a Web page to finish purchase, though. Great tool.",,,
2011,5,All the airlines and flights are there. Good ui. No ads. Great to see this now has the flexible date and flexible destination search. Very cool.,,,
2011,2,"When editing filters or search preferences there is no 'enter' or 'execute' button.Sometimes the back button works to save your selections, not always",,,
2011,4,Why don't the filters apply when looking at the chart? I want to know what the cheapest days to fly with a certain airline are! Thanks.,,,
2011,4,"Nice app, but room for improvement.. (One the reasons up have this app is so I DON'T have to call Southwest for quotes..) Get Southwest on board, well",,,
2011,4,"Samsung Tablet: works a dream. Will have to give it more of a bash before giving it a 5* rating, but so far so good.",,,
2011,1,The option to select specific dates doesn't work at all on my Asus Transformer running Honeycomb 3.,,,
2011,5,Functionality is great but it's the comprehensive search engine that makes this app gold.  It's has saved me countess hours of trawling the net,,,
2011,5,It is like a one stop for searching my desired flights! The UI is great and the sorting and filtering are awesome! Great job!,,,
2011,2,"It's neat, but needs more airlines... Everything is pretty high within the ones it has loaded... Travelocity and orbitz plus others has better rates",,,
2011,5,Really well designed and intuitive. Have been looking around for a good flight app. Great on HTC Desire,,,
2011,5,"Brilliant stuff. Very clear, to the point. Fabulous filters, very user friendly n easy to operate. Full marks :)",,,
2011,2,"But will have to uninstall it as, it doesn't compare with any cheap air lines, can get a flight to Kuala Lumpur for half the price on another airline.",,,
2011,5,"Incredible, always finds the best offers. Could have some kind of notification to let me know when airlines have deals on my preferred routes.",,,
2011,2,In turkey there 6 airlines at least as far as i know. However it can only find the flights of two airlines. Prices don't seem to be realistic.,,,
2011,5,and please add it with indonesian language further..,,,
2011,3,Good UI. Better than Google's ITA software. Could improve in some countries like India.,,,
2011,2,I could not choose departure and return date at all. Prefer the previous version,,,
2011,5,Great app.....this is a nice app. For checking out prices and times of flights from any airport...._ right from your phone.,,,
2011,5,"VERY nice app, I love the ""chart"" feature! Helps you see the best dates for the cheapest flights",,,
2011,4,Great app but billing country option does not seem to work. Booking is still over UK even if I am not,,,
2012,3,"Very good but would be nice to see prices for more than one airline on each selected day, not just the cheapest on the monthly view.",,,
2011,4,"Quick and accurate - much faster than a pc, but does not show extra charges like like credit card fees and carry-on baggage charges. Ilove it.",,,
2011,5,very useful. hope in the future we can search flights for a certain period to find the lowest fair. keep up the good work,,,
2011,4,"Great start, better than most others but not like a web app. Need to be able to bracket travel days to view alternate fairs",,,
2011,5,Too good an app if you are a frequent traveller... Must download... Galaxy tab P1000..,,,
2011,4,I fly two to three times per year and this app gives very close prices as advertised online. It's nice that Skyscanner compares multiple Web sites.,,,
2011,5,Very helpful in finding best deals on flights instantly. Works great in Samsung galaxy S2 and galaxy tab 10.1,,,
2011,5,"A really great app. Complete, friendly, smooth, all you want is where you expect it to be. Thanks!",,,
2011,4,"It's a lil slow, but other then that the results are impressive and I'm flying out to NY in 2 weeks and I'll use this app to buy my tickets",,,
2011,4,I'd give it the 5th star if it offered alternative airports where no flights exist. (e.g. London has 5 different carriers use different airports),,,
2011,4,"It does the job, no crashes yet... A search of travel agency prices would be nice as they sometimes are cheaper than the airlines.",,,
2011,4,Great app and idea. Love the open destination. Would get 5 stars if I could do the same for the dates.,,,
2011,5,Perfect application. Provides travel options. Keep it up!,,,
2011,2,Does not scan all flights.  If it did Southwest Airlines would be listed.  Description from developer is misleading.,,,
2011,5,Great app.. Wish it had the multiple destination option.. Though it still deserves 5 stars,,,
2012,4,"Very user friendly, without annoying ads. Highly recommended !",,,
2011,4,"Great app. I found two great fares for a very low price. Also, the ability to share the link for the fare is very helpful.",,,

2011,5,The most useful android app to user who usually travel for vacation or work. Two thumps up!!,,,

2011,5,"Great app! Simple to use, and great results! If you like the website (which is awesome!), then deciding to install this is a no-brainer. Although it's obviously aimed at phones it works well on my Asus Transformer, although I really hope to see a tablet-optimized version some time soon! The iPhone app has been out for a while, so it's really good to see it on Android.",,,
2011,5,"works on galaxy tab 7"". Ticket prices may not be very accurate, at least the flights database is impressive. Needs real time flight tracking on map.",,,
2011,4,The app found cheap flights easily. Too bad you cannot purchase the flight from within the app. It send you to their web site which is clumsy on phone,,,
2011,4,"Good app, quite quick findings. Would be useful if sort by airlines be an option. I'm using it time to time for quick comparison :)",,,
2011,4,Easy to use and nice interface. just needs to have a flexible date search to find cheaper flights. Apart from that it's great.,,,
2011,1,Clearly connected to the internet to be able to install and submit feedback but search says I'm not connected. Seriously? Great app? Hardly think so,,,
2011,4,This app is simple to use and seems to be connected to almost all commercial airlines. This makes this tool very useful to have. GREAT APP!,,,
2011,5,Awesome n super user friendly!!! Jst Wat I needed.. tells u flights so u cb make informed travel decisions..,,,

2011,4,Very good app. But hey i'm missing something or the Pound is the only currency available?! Please fix.,,,
2011,3,Would be 5* if it allowed you to search a month or year like the website as I don't always know my exact dates.,,,
2011,2,Definitely not the lowest airfares!!! Averages $300 over cost if I called the airline directly! Uninstall,,,
2011,5,Fantastic app! Used it to book flights with no problem.,,,
2011,5,Simple to use. Much easier than using the web page on your phone.,,,
2011,5,Next step would be to add customisable stopover points (by departure dates) to avoid having to go back & make multiple searches.,,,
2011,4,but the andriod version should have the chart just like in the iOS. 5 star if its better to the other version,,,
2011,5,Wow. Really good. Seems a bit big for what it does but great usability. Very simple and efficient design.,,,

2011,5,"Excellent Application. Very easy to use, very well thought out shortcuts and very fast.",,,
2011,5,I'm just an aviation enthusiast but I love this app. It does what I want.,,,

2011,4,"Simple and effective, hope they add some more features from the website into future android versions",,,

2011,4,Great. Thanks for the android version. The latest iPhone updates are great so hoping and looking forward to them being incorporated,,,
2011,1,"OK, but with less functionality than through a browser, since whilst you can search for the cheapest for a given date, you can't do whole months/years",,,
2011,1,"Can't get any airports, countries at all. No results...please help!! Android",,,
2011,5,Fantastic app! Works like a charm and lists every airport and destination I can possibly think to search for.,,,

2011,5,Great! Sort by landing time + recently search features,,,
2011,5,Must have app for those who love to be spontaneous n travel last min,,,
2016,1,"Its way to over ""pretty"" now. No graphs showing future prices anymore. Difficult to get the information you want. Keep it simple, keep it clean. New version a big fail in my opinion. Shame, was one of the most useful apps I had. In fact the 729 Airlines  app has it nailed. Plus it finds cheaper flights and the price remains the same when you go to book it instead of teasing you with a price and then inflating when you go to book it like this app does. Roll it back guys, newer is not always better.",,,
2016,1,"This used to be my go-to app for searching and booking flights. I loved the calendar view and all the options it came with. Since the latest major update and facelift, I find it extremely frustrating and not user-friendly at all. So much so, that I have stopped using it and am considering uninstalling it. It's a shame really...",,,
2017,4,"It is a nice useful app, but it needs refinements. I used it to look for flight for more than a month and booked through it. It would have made a great difference for me to be able to have an alert on price for flexible dates around those I chose. Instead, I had to recheck every possibility each time. The principal problem is regarding cost of flight. First, flight prices kept changing because of currency. Second, it assumes every airlines as being equal and rate them on price, while a few of them don't offer baggages and food in their price, so you will end up paying extra with those airlines, while some of the more expensive options would have ended up to the same price, since everything is included in the shown price.",,,
2016,1,"After the recent update, new version is absolutely unusable. Instead of getting clear and concise information now you are watching pretty pictures of airplanes, vacation destinations and hotel adds. Used to be a great app. Now it's a colorful toy for teenagers. Besides, the prices stated have no relation to reality. Uninsalling.",,,
2018,1,"This app used to be great but now they allow these predatory travel sites 
to advertise FAKE RATES just to get you to their website and collect your 
info. It's EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING to keep finding ""deals"" that don't exist. 
This should NOT be allowed on your site/app! I hope you fix this soon bc 
you will definitely lose users.",,,
2016,1,This was always my favorite app for finding our next adventure. Since the update change it has become useless to me.  We would always search everywhere and anytime as our schedule was always flexible and we were excited to find our next unexpected trip location based on rates.  Now with the new updates this app is of no use to me!!...PLEASE FIX IT AND RETURN IT TO THE GREAT APP IT ONCE WAS!!!,,,
2018,1,"FRAUD.DONT FALL FOR THIS.THIS IS A SCAM. Booked a flight from happyeasygo 
which was shown by this app. They didn't book my flight and haven't 
returned my money either. What's worse is I called them 10 hours before the 
flight,and got to know that they didn't book it because they said the 
airline company's rate was higher.I was left stranded in an unknown place 
with my money blocked in their stupid transaction. Don't fall for this 
scam. It might work for some but it's not reliable. Use more authentic apps 
like Cleartrip which infact gave me a much better deal with an earlier 
time,but had to call someone for money.",,,
2016,1,"Thankyou for your reply. Firstly you can't type 'everywhere', you have to scroll down the page and then your can't choose price by country, you have to scroll through every city on earth. On the second point you are wrong. I would suggest opening skyscanner on your phone browser and app and see which is easier to find something... your mobile webpage is better and is what the app used to be...",,,
2016,3,"I used to swear by skyscanner, and still do find the website to be great, however recent updates have led me to become frustrated with the app- it's no longer possible to look for one way flights, and the ""everywhere"" search option only works sometimes. As I'm currently traveling around the world, the one way flights is a deal breaker for me-I don't buy round trip tickets. Additionally, looking across wide time spans for flights has gotten flashier but less useful, by skyscanner showing only some prices",,,
2016,1,"This is really an update that is trying to fix things that aren't broken. Now, the one thing that it needs to do, find the best flight rates, can hardly be done anymore. It's getting sooo complicated and the prices shown in the results are really never the correct prices. Keeping things simple seems very hard.",,,
2016,2,Yes the new version has pretty pictures but it's now functionally useless. Skyscanner's USP was the ability to make ONE search easily over a range of airports over a range of dates then pick the most suited. Try to do that now and you find the simple functional interface that allowed you drill down to the best date/price has been replaced by a few random search results. Multiple searches are now necessary making skyscanner the same as all the rest.,,,
2016,1,Oh no; how frustrating when my favourite and most useful app ( I'm a frequent flier) turns into a piece of cr*p. ¬£900 to fly London to Glasgow and no flights at all next year from London to Brisbane. I don't think so. You will lose a serious volume of bookings.  Oh and you most the bar charts showing nearby dates. One of the best features of the old version,,,
2013,2,This could be a good ap. Problem is can not see a price for simple search.  Like Denver to KC. Developer probably could figure it out if they input info but average joe like me found app useless. Maybe they should go to a mall and ask total stranger to try and do a search. That way they can see how it functions for 1st time user.,,,
2018,1,The feature to search for flights by the cheapest dates is not available in the app. That's literally the only reason I'd use this app over all the other similar apps. They've left out the one thing they had going for them.   Also the email address listed to contact them isn't valid.,,,
2017,1,I unistalled the app because it keeps opening itself without me clicking on it. Specially when I leave the phone for some minutes and I come back the app is opened. This must be some kind of trick for you to use it more. I turned off notifications but it will not stop. End of the story with this service.,,,
2016,1,New update includes hotels and car hire which I'm not interested in. Also when you want to search the cheapest flight from your location it now only shows you places nearby and annoyingly shows every airports price. Not just the cheap flight for that country like it used to. This app now sucks.,,,
2016,1,"Each 'update' seems to make things worse. This latest one the prices aren't accurate and they even show up cheap prices for routes not even available for your dates selected as click bait. The website is the same now, guess I'll be moving to Google flights.",,,
2015,1,"Unfortunately, you had a very intuitive app and decided to radically revise this... for marketing reasons, new UX designers, or basic need to reform. But got it wrong. Sometimes needs time for users to adapt, get over change resistance. On this occasion, that is unlikely. For eg., the price, arguably most significant data, now fades into background. How do I time box my departure or arrival time now??? Smart enough to made great app, am sure you can fix it!",,,
2015,4,Since i updated to android 5.0. This app doesnt correspond at all n just stays black screen. Nt happy pls fix this n i wil give 5 stars... recent update fixes my problem n works ok now 4 stars,,,
2013,1,Would be a great app if the prices were accurate. It lists all of the airlines and their prices in the search results but then when you click the links the actual prices are so far off it makes the app useless. You wind up having to look at each flight and airline manually one by one and take notes of the prices to figure out who has the cheapest fare when this app is supposed to do that for you to save you the time. Waste of space.,,,
2015,1,"Since the new update, I now am unable at a glance see the cheapest flights. The bar chart without the cost is crazy as you have to click on each individual bar whereas before you could see the cheapest flights around the date you wanted. What was a great app is now less user friendly, I hate it",,,
2018,2,"Deleted the app because some of the travel agencies used are suspect. I 
received daily notifications of fare changes every time from an agency call 
HOP2. After researching HOP2 found out they don't advertise live fares. So 
how are they changing daily? Also multiple complaints about fraudulent 
credit card usage after purchasing through HOP2. I was unable to filter out 
fares from HOP2.",,,
2015,2,"I've used skyscanner for all my flights for a couple of years now. It has been simple, informative usually accurate. The update is more complicated to use, provides less information in the month view and the indicative prices seem to be way off. I hope the desktop version is still useful.",,,
2016,1,"We used to love this app for finding cheap flights to anywhere. I'm not sure what this app is good for now. It's not a good flight search app, this much I know. It doesn't even show all the available flights. I can only assume the original creator sold this app and the new owner is running it into the ground.",,,
2016,5,"The app itself works fine - if i can find it?! Its never on my phone, only way i can get onto it is by going to play store, finding it and clicking open.  It seems to be unsearchable on my apps page and theres no app icon to touch.          ***edited***                   app needed an update which i wasnt able to do as when i clicked update i recieved an error message saying app was already installed. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Now have an app shortcut on my home screen too. 5 stars now",,,
2016,1,Deleted it straight away can't find a flight and hate not been able to view the deals straight away.  Yes update your app but not to the point that it's Completely changed. The old app I could find a bargain and plot when I wanted to go when it was cheap but this app it's too long winded,,,
2016,1,"I always use the website to start my flight searches, but this app is awful! It doesn't let you search for cheapest month to travel (you have to specify a date). I thought flexible flying was the whole point of this site!!!",,,
2016,2,"Oh dear, what have they done! This used to be such a slick app, in fact one of the best examples of efficient UI design. Sadly no longer... I can only imagine they've changed app developer as it's such a big change, and very much in the wrong direction :-(",,,
2014,1,"Uninstalled, it might be good for some one that needs a flight in a pinch but it does not have enough options for me. I wanted a one way ticket there was not an option for that. Then i saw a cheap price but when i tried to get the information it was not accessible. Thanks though good idea.",,,
2011,4,"Picks up most airlines and flights, including ones not on Saber.  Better than a travel agent.  Also cool if you fly to remote places, can see all direct flights to, from that airport. Some annoying interface issues, but well worth it overall.",,,
2018,1,"Lame app...had it in my phone for a long time. When I finally had to use it, it showed me no flights between two major airports. ""Check your internet connection while we check our servers"" is all it had to say. Uninstalled.",,,
2016,1,"I once used this app constantly but then I got a new phone and used the browser for a while, now I just install the new version, tried to search for flights and uninstalled it promptly. Perhaps the way Skyscanner can avoid embarrassment would be to offer the old app as Skyscanner simple or something similar then you can slowly pull support from this app which it seems nobody likes.",,,
2018,3,"Unable to filter out air asia from search. However,filtering out vietjet works. How come? I've had bad experiences with air asia, so don't particularly want to see their flights at the top on each and every search I perform. Same story for both app and web (air Asia is unfilterable!)",,,
2017,1,"You can find cheaper flights by searching manually. My advice to travellers is to search for flights through each airline website, use Turo for car rentals, and airbnb for lodging. The cheapest airline from my airport was not even listed as an option :^)",,,
2016,1,Prices shown in the app do NOT show what flights cost. Once you filled in all the details on the referring websites prices all of a sudden jump up. In my case from 400 to 2000 pounds with a message if you still want to go ahead and buy the flights.,,,
2016,5,"I LOVE Skyscanner! It's my main go-to travel site, mainly because it gives a wider range of travel dates to combine and compare for the lowest price. Plus I love the feature of getting a daily list of updates on my chosen dates...whether rdtrp or 1-way.",,,
2013,5,Just downloaded it and it found heaps of flights with so much ease. It searches for months in advance so a quick swipe moves along weeks with a great graphical user face. The price found was the exact same as on the airlines website.... I checked after. Fantastic.,,,
2015,1,"I select a flight, get redirected to some ""transgenio"" site for booking. After I give all my details the price is 200 euros higher. I cancel promptly. Next day they have the attitude to send me a mail offering a 10 euro discount! This site and app should be investigated by the consumer protection authorities for abusive practices",,,
2016,1,"You absolutely killed Skyscanner, now it is like any other app. This used to be the best app for searching for flights. The Everywhere or the from Whole Country features are gone.

2018,2,"MUCH worse than the website.I need to use the browser because the application is very limited.I can't choose the best month for a travel, or using the whole month research I can't see the prices of each day but only colored dots and I need to click on each day to know the price.If you don't need to departing in a specific day and time Skyscanner can let you save a lot of money...but the website,NOT the application...this one it's useless without the same features.",,,
2017,1,The app has wrong prices for flights and the websites that you use to book increase the price if the flight. It is not the first time use the app but today I payed 190‚Ç¨ more than the real price without noticing it. I hate and I want  refund for my flight.,,,
2017,1,"It kept giving me the wrong price for the flights.  Every time I tried to book a flight through them when it redirected me to the Web site the price was different.  It was more expensive.  When I got alerts about prices going down, it was also inaccurate.",,,
2014,1,SGS4. Running Kitkat the official Samsung OTA firmware upgrade.  Returns the above error when trying to login via FB. Have uninstalled this waste of time. Apple iOS version works soooo much better!,,,
2012,4,"This is a great start but it would be helpful if there was a filter added for layover airports.  It would also be helpful to have the layover points shown without having to check the detail.    Finally, the app I really would like to see is one where you could enter a specific itinerary on a specific airline and have the app continue to check the airfare for that itinerary and notify me when it goes down.  Some airlines will refund if the fare drops after you bought, so this would be helpful to monitor that.  Otherwise, great app.",,,
2016,5,I always use Skyscanner to book all of my flights because I'm never able to find them cheaper anywhere else. Also the app is so easy to use.. I especially like how you can choose open bookings instead of specific dates,,,
2016,1,The exact same flights we're over $20 higher with the app verses using Google flights and going directly to the airline. Obviously they say no commissions but they increase the price put it in the face and that's how they get their Commission,,,
2018,5,"I love this app! Not only for cheapest flights, but because how it's made.

Greetings to the designer, hope one day to work with team like yours :)",,,
2013,1,"This app used to include United Airlines. Now that it excludes them, you will NEVER get the best overseas flight prices. All their prices for other airlines are a minimum of $300 more. This is too bad. I used to use this app for all my trips. Now I am uninstalling.",,,
2015,2,"Poor information. For example, Singapore return Shanghai on 16 Jul to 2 Aug, App showing cheapest flight of SGD104 but actual search give Malaysia airline at SGD463.

2016,1,"I do not understand it ,when I first installed this app multi city just seemed to be standard. Now I can not find out if it is possible. Or am I doing something wrong. A real shame if you can not search multi city options. Thanks Dave H",,,
2017,1,"At the time of searching on skyscanner, it shows a price... but at the time of checkout, the main booking websites say ""The price has increased, you can book another flight or continue with the new price."" What a 3rd grade system, that's unable to show right prices !!!!",,,
2012,1,"According to this app, there are no flights from Hartford, CT to Chicago, IL on my selected date.. I know there are dozens of flights every day between these two locations, and have in fact found several on my travel date, through several other services. This app is worthless.",,,

2015,1,It used to show a complete list of flights from all different airlines and schedules as well. Now i can only see the cheapest estimation. Do I miss it somewhere? Help please,,,

2015,5,Best app for finding flights. Leave your destination open and select your closest airport for departure and Skyscanner will find the cheapest flights out there to random spots! Flew to Colombia from Ft Lauderdale for 80 bucks flew to Jamaica from ft Lauderdale for 55. Didn't plan either trip,,,
2016,4,App is big on convenience and efficiency. There are times where I find a different/better price going directly to the carrier's site.,,,

2017,2,Nowhere near as easy to use as the website. Kept wanting to use my location despite selecting 'dont ask again',,,
2013,1,Pricing is different once you go to book. Might as well have gone to the company site in the begining. Waste of time go between that gives inaccurate pricing.,,,
2013,5,"Been using SS for years now, the app works great. Thanks for all the great cheap trips!",,,
2016,2,Mobile website is better. Lacks the option to do a multi city trip and filtering more than one airline is broken.,,,
