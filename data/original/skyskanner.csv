year,rating,review
2023,5,"This app is great! But I have a suggestion. It would be great if rather than searching for flights from specific cities/airports, I have the option to search for flights all airports in a specific area. For example, I live in Philly but I am more than willing to drive to EWR, JFK, IAD etc if those airports have a better deal. Being able to search airports within 100 miles of where I am would be a game changer."
2021,3,"Upon updating the app, it appears that a lot of the previously removed functionality has been returned to the app. Estimated prices in the date window are back, although somewhat less expansive that I would hope (and fewer than appear using google flights). The bar graph view is not here though, which is disappointing. The explore feature doesn't feel streamlined and feels a little too ""curated"" for my liking. Estimated prices for suggested travel cities don't show up in the explore page."
2020,1,"The latest version as of 25DEC2020 is absolute garbage. Can't search a range of dates, can't find an option to search anything other than one way, and can no longer even get a price on the month view, just a series of colored dots with no explanation of what they represent. This is a classic case of trying to fix what isn't broken. This is a garbage update that I am proud to say will drive me to uninstalling unless it's reverted and never looking back. I've used this app since 2012/13, no more."
2020,1,"The New View is Terrible! Primarily for esthetics and functionality, please return to the previous format. Feels like an MS-DOS search. This was the best app for finding destinations. Part of the selection process involved seeing pictures of the destinations/prices and plugging in timeframes based on that. Now you dont see any of those things. Takes you straight to a calender??? The whole purpose of the app is to not HAVE to choose a date for your vacation."
2021,1,"Years ago, I found great flights on this app. I travel US to Europe. Now, all the cheapest providers that pop up are some BS companies nobody has ever heard of, with lots of negative reviews. No thank you. This app is now nothing but a waste of time. Uninstalling. Here's a tip: Every time I have flown for the last twenty years or so, Expedia has had the best deals and I booked through them. (For me, it's regular flights, no hotel or car, no last minute or standby.) Always a great experience."
2023,1,Out dated App. I used to use this as my go to flight search for booking overseas. I would promote it with my family and friends for years. Then this past year- year n half it's gone downhill. It claims I can get a flight for X amount when I click to book suddenly doubles or triples in price. Never did that before. I don't trust it anymore and honestly have just been using other mainstream apps since those work. Gave up after the mainstream ones gave better deals. Sorry Sky scanner.
2021,1,"Horrible, horrible app. App going down the drain since last few years. Can't even set ""Departing From"" other than your specific location? What happens if you're checking flights for your parents or someone's else by using a different city to depart from and not your current location? App becomes totally useless. Also, a me of the vendors listed in the the search results are bunch of scammer. Horrible, horrible app."
2021,1,"Skyscanner used to be the only place I'd even look for flights (after lot sof experience of it being the best every time I compared results) but the redesign they did, I guess in the last year is awful. All the good filtering options are gone. It's slow and confusing,l. I literally can't even figure out what currency it's showing me prices for. It's completely awful now and I don't know how this got approved to be done."
2019,1,This app is really convenient until you find out that they charge different people different prices for no reason. Any flight my girlfriend searches will have a list of flight prices and times. When I search the EXACT SAME FLIGHTS I am charged at least 200 more and at least 10 hours more of travel. I've tried to contact these people but their phone number is very well hidden. I do not know why I am being over charged for the exact same flights or why my searches do not yield the same results.
2019,1,"Could be a good app but the prices on my saved trips doesn't update & hasn't since I created them. Everytime I open the app, it shows the same price from 30 days ago. I don't see any feature to refresh it other than clicking into the trip & hitting check prices. Even after doing so, the price on the trip page still reflects 30 days ago. I thought the app would automatically refresh the prices on the saved trip page without having to click into it. Uninstalled."
2019,5,"Fantastic app. The UI is clean and the filters are unusually powerful for a mobile app. My only complaint is that I wish the desktop site showed the plane type and features the same way the app does. I like to fly larger planes if possible, so knowing if my flight legs are going to be on a 737 or a 777 matters to me, and that isn't something I can see on the desktop website."
2021,2,"Really good app idea but everytime it shows me a low flight price in the explore section and then I click on it, the actual price is much more expensive which makes it pretty much useless... Also, it would be nice if I could select flexible dates. For example, I could select the start date and end date of my spring break and then have it show me all the cheapest flights within those dates whether it be a 3 day trip, 5 day trip, or a trip for the whole week."
2021,1,the app has evolved away from what attracted me to it many years ago. I used to enjoy planning my vacations with the graph pricing feature. it made my decisions easy and affordable. the apps current interface is more limited and confusing. will probably seek other options since prices are relative and ease of discovery and purchase are my most important concerns.
2022,5,"I don't review often but I have to say after traveling to Greece, Georgia, Florida, and California using this app, I am one happy consumer. This may be the best app I've ever used for a few reasons. - Shows you a list of all flight combinations with specific parameters or within a time range. Filter is easy to use. - You can save a search and than save that specific trip. and it will actually notify you when the price changes. - Doesn't save your info to price gouge. 10/10 on the appüëç"
2019,2,"So as a person who loves to travel and always travels on a budget, there's better apps and websites out there. I mostly use Expedia because they offer packages. I always travel alone (which is always pricier) but I wanted to compare prices for a trip to Dublin,Ireland for Dec 2019. Same days, same airlines,same hotel and car rental. Skyscanner was 500 dollars more than what Expedia offered. Just do your research and happy travels! üòÅ"
2020,1,Went from the best app to use for finding cheap flights to finding the most expensive flights. 12k to fly across the country in economy. Not when I did the leg work and found the same on a different site for less than 400. Cant find out the cheapest day to fly out anymore. Some of us travel for fun.. well now you've taken out how to plan an efficient vacation and making it more leg work. I've now uninstalled this app due to the issues that have happened.
2022,5,"Unbelievable! The dev team actually implemented a feature I requested. Previously, the app didn't show the date of arrival at your destination when searching for flights. This is important when flying across different time zones. I posted a review and sent them an email and they promised to do it. I'm really thankful to them. Best travel app ever."
2020,2,I've used this app twice now and got mixed results. The 1st time was excellent. Got a round trip ticket last year no problem. This year I've tried to book and both times I get an error message. I called the airline and was told on 2 different occasions that those flights are sold out and that's why after I submit my payment that it gets kicked out. Why wouldn't Skyscanner know that flights are unavailable and why wait until you've already submitted payment? Won't use this app again.
2020,1,"Hate it!! Go back to the way it was!! I LOVED it because we could filter by cheapest month and no other site does that! Well NOW you don't either! The site went from number 1 to useless! I used it EVERY TIME I planned to travel, just went to South Korea using this! Now it is junk!! Please restore that feature! People need to stop trying to fix things that aren't broken! Give us the old one back please!!"
2022,5,very competitive rates and the app is easy to navigate. I like getting updates sent to my phone home screen when there is a price drop. I like how the details of each flight are given and it is noted if a self transfer must occur between airports. the self transfer actually saves you quite a bit of money on flights with one or more stops.
2020,3,"This used to be an essential part of my trip planning. The feature that set them apart from other aggregators was the map graph. You could see the pricing options and decide when to depart and when to return based on that. A powerful tool! It went from being the default view, to an option that you had to turn on, to now removed. They have forgotten their roots and what made them special. Now they are trying to compete with the other aggregations. There isn't any extra reason now to use it"
2022,4,"I've always enjoyed this App & prices are nearly always available that it lists. My only complaint is about the limitations of the search everywhere feature because it gives me tons of U.S. cities because obviously they are cheaper than Itnl flts. This is annoying because I want an Intl Destination. The Best & Easiest Fix is to offer search by Continent or Region like: Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, Pacific Islands, S. America & N. America, etc. This would really help save Time & Money!"
2022,1,"This is said to be the best travel search engine but the functionality is horrible. (A) half the time the SET PRICE ALERT button doesn't appear anywhere & (B) on my homescreen there's a ""4"" in a red circle on Skyscanner's app which I assume means I have 4 messages but I can't find any way to retrieve them. There's no msg button! This is frustrating when you're competition (Kayak and Hopper) always function flawlessly 100% of the time. (PLS REPLY HERE. IF U SEND A MSG IN THE APP I CAN'T OPEN). TY"
2021,1,"Why strip away all the features that made Skyscanner an excellent app? Years ago, Skyscanner was intuitive, informative, streamlined, interactive, and flexible. You could easily select ""nearby airports"" to view alternatives; ""flexible dates"" to show better fares near your search dates, or ""view entire month"" to see all known fares for each day within a month. You could set filters for flight duration, number of stops, airlines, and price. All of these features are gone. Skyscanner is dead."
2019,1,"Horrific in the US... I first learned about this app through my travels in Asia and have to say it has saved me time and money on that continent. However, in the US when I search for flights I only get the ""major"" carriers and very few if not, none of the budget carriers show up in the search. I just saved $120 on RT flights by NOT using this app"
2022,1,"This used to be a great app that lets you explore the cheapest flights across a wide range of locations and potential dates. It allowed you to plan a flight date and location around the cheapest option. Now the app has reduced functionality, only allowing you to enter predetermined dates and locations to search for tickets. Skyscanner, what happened?!?"
2021,3,"it was better before the update. The good thing its that now it will search roundtrip and give you results from different airlines, I use to search flights just one way to go and return so in that way I was able to find the best deals from differents airlines. The best thing from the old app was the scale graphic of prices per date now you just have the option to look in the calendar instead of this way"
2019,1,"I tried Skyscanner and found it not very good.  Plugged in a roundtrip from Local City to Washington Dulles.  Matched its results against Expedia.  This is where everything failed.  Came up with different prices and had to go way down the list to find my outgoing flight. Selected it and then return screen would only show me the same airline coming back.  Pricing was $150 higher then Expedia directly.  Seems with this scenario, it will only show same airline going and returning which in the real world is not always the cheapest fair and cheap price is not always cheapest to fly.  You have to take also into consideration now baggage fees and flight times"
2019,2,"This is one of those rare situations where the app is inferior to the mobile website. While it is a pain in the butt to continue going to the website each time I want to use this service, I find the app clunky and simply not as functional. The website allows you to search flights by month and see prices for each day during that month. This app only allows viewing prices by color (red for high) similar to other flight apps such as kayak. I will continue using the website and uninstall the app."
2022,2,"Prices jump if you check too many times. Edit: I realized that the issue is that the advertised price isn't consistent with the price that you're given when proceeding through the app. For instance, London to Corfu, Greece is advertised as 55 pounds. Once I click and it searches for the round trip, the price jumps to 85 pounds per person while still in the app."
2022,1,"I decided to go to a different rental car company (N√º) and different app (Expedia) because they took 1,000+ on an unauthorized charge. I decided to use Skyscanner, I found economy bookings, who uses the rent plus counter at the prague Airport. Without my consent, N√º came back to be refusing my request for the full refund with the contract I had through economybookings. I am very disappointed in Skyscanner and Expedia for being this irresponsible."
2019,5,"**Edit ** AWESOME update, devs! I was literally just wishing for the ability to find the best dates to fly back to visit family. I already love the explore anywhere feature, and Skyscanner regularly catches deals that other apps don't. I recommend this app to anyone who loves to travel, and with your newest addition I can recommended it to people who grew up elsewhere and fly home. I've had this app for years and it's awesome."
2021,1,Skyscanner was recommended to me but I couldn't figure out what the big deal was. Functioned just like any other travel app. It gave very specific dates even on the full month search (which was very hard to find btw). Instead of giving up I watched recent YouTube reviews. The positive ones only review the website. Turns out this app is lacking the main functionality of website - the month feature that shows all dates' prices in a calendar. Game changer. Not in this app at all only on site. Dumb.
2021,2,"Searching is difficult. I specifically want to search flights without set dates. I know it can be done, but it's difficult to get to. Nothing in support to help. OH, and my ""trip type"" is not even an option, it only goes up to 7 days, I want 10. Basically, the search options for what I'm trying to find don't actually exist in this app."
2021,2,I loved this app for years. Since the recent update I find that's its much harder to use and more difficult to find the cheapest flights possible. What happened to the estimate price on the calendar or the bar graph with estimate prices. The older format was a lot more functional. Bring it back.
2020,1,"What happened to the explore option? If you wanted to find a cheap flight to anywhere, you used to be able to filter by worldwide, by cheapest month, cheapest days etc. All this is gone. It's now just a simple a flight from X airport to X airport. This is terrible. I have to go to the desktop version to use the fully functional Skyscanner"
2019,5,"I love this app. However, recently, when I choose explore everywhere and select a month, it won't go forward to the search. It reverts to the explore everywhere page on my android device. This feature has worked before though, so I have no doubt this glitch will be quickly fixed. The dev team for this app seems to be top notch."
2023,1,"I've gone through most reviews made about this app and support the comments. You select dates and find good deals, once you click roundtrip only, flight search results return crazy prices for one way.What happens to the good deals showing before one makes a choice of dates? Searching flights incognito doesn't help in anyway as the app still lets cookies track and alter your preferences."
2018,4,"Not all the features of the website, but still useful and handy. Try a spontaneous trip by putting in your home airport and no destination. Go where it sounds interesting and cheap. I've seen a couple great things on a long weekend or two that way that I wouldn't have normally."
2023,3,"interactions arent as expected, features in mobile and web are different and/or missing. data pulled for save trip (before booking) isn't accurate, makes the save trips feature unusable. overall, looking for flights is easy but don't expect to save any of the trips for future research or comparison because data isn't accurate or can't pull any data"
2023,3,"The platform is quick and easy to use however where it becomes very difficult is the indicated values for ""flights from..."" shown with each date. These never exist in reality and are usually in fact way off. As cost is the method most of us want to search by it makes it very frustrating and difficult due to the vast difference between what the app shows and is then available when you view tickets for each date. This makes the benefit of the apps date overviews essentially useless"
2023,3,"I'm no longer receiving updates, defeating the purpose of my use for this app. I have had to manually check the app multiple times as I'm suddenly not receiving notifications anymore. I've checked the settings, my phone has all notifications enabled and the option is ticked inside the app. The tickets for my trip have gone up or down with no updates. Considering just deleting the app and manually checking the provider directly since it would be more reliable."
2023,3,"Earlier I would give you 10* but now you are at strong 3*. The reasons are I miss a lot the price list for almost every date in axmonth in following year (now it's available only for 3-4 in advance) and the 2nd thing is the other way of choosing dates for travel,with charts/sticks. That was helping me a lot to plan all my vacations a to travel more ... Now all the apps are the same:("
2023,1,"We booked the flight ticket through HappyFares, assuming that Skyscanner had done the due diligence. We received the tickets (PNR: YJQ8SH; SG-430) with correct passengers‚Äô details. When we reached the airport there was a mistake in my name (total 3 from my family). Due to the name difference, I did not get the boarding pass while two of my family members took the boarding pass. I was told by the agent to book the ticket and they would refund it. However, we are not even getting reply on email."
2023,4,"This app is very easy and usefull to check flights, I have used it to book 2 flights now, but recently it shows self transfer and no self transfer for same flights time to time, I have booked a batik to batik transit via KUL from CMB to HKG on Oct 10 2023, next Tuesday, FLIGHT result on this app clearly showed no self transfer when I'm booking. And I checked it with 3 separate people to verify no self tranfer, NOW after several hours of payment it shows self transfer in app, I'm so lost now ü§¶üôé"
2023,1,I have booked a round trip fr 3 pax but havent received any conformation emial or watsapp even after the payment deduction from my bank account to interglobe aviation ltd as mentioned on the UPI request. Kindly upgrade your app n contact me as your contact no is not mentioned. Hoping to get a quick reply from your end. My flight is within 2 days
2023,2,"Really wish Skyscanner realised that allowing customers to add 'direct flights only' at the *beginning* of a search would be very useful and save searchers loads of time. Who wants a 2 hour flight that takes 30 hours with 1,2,3,4 stops - just ridiculous, but as usual Skyscanner never listen to customers and the reviews given by genuine users. Would rather see the price for direct flights NOT cheap multi stop flights."
2023,2,"There is a bug when saving a multi-city flight. It is saved as a return flight, where the second city gets replaced with the first city, so the flight becomes invalid when you review it."
2023,1,Doesn't have any record of the bookings and partners. You can be cheated by any provider. I am trying to change the booking but no contact for the service provider. Really unprofessional. I booked flight tickets on Oct 02 now I wish to change my booking but Indigo is asking to do it with your booking partner. Now I have no access to my booking on Skyscanner and no mail from the booking partner. So I have no clue whom to reach.
2023,2,The new update messed up the whole experience. Earlier we were able to see multiple options of round trip of flights for a month. Now just 1 shows
2023,1,"Lots of people around me suggested this app,I thought to give it a try.I regret that decision because this app doesn't work at first place. When you search for flights you get to know where to where and it's price but when you click on particular option it doesn't show any results."
2023,2,"I hate the new version, not convenient at all. When you just download it, it works well, but changes to a new version soon, very difficult to be used."
2023,4,"Constantly throws error while searching for the complete list of flights. Needs to be fixed ASAP as this is serving no purpose Edit: this is working as expected now, thank you"
2023,1,Fraud app. Travel Date automatic change while payment..... Book carefully.. if u want video proof then ask me i will show u... Book ticket with geniune way otherwise ready for harras... There is no any contact number for this app..
2023,1,"Prices in the app are 3 times higher than on the website since about 6 months. It looks like a bug, deinstalled."
2023,1,Problem is they link to sites like edreams which are just scam sites. As long as they do they should just change the name to Skyscammer I was left stranded.
2023,1,"Skyscanner has been a really useful app until recently when they appeared to remove the feature which told you whether a checked bag was included or not in the price of each flight in your search results. Now, this does not appear. Useful data, removed for no apparent reason. I see they are very responsive to constructive criticism so I'm hoping someone sees this and reverts this terrible change! ///// Update: I will watch and hope that this feature is added back again as they suggest!"
2023,2,"the price increased by about $6 when I went to pay it, without any reason I could find. not impressed at all !!"
2023,5,My son said me for this app! I am so satifadeI'm so happy with it! I just used it and I'm so happy with the flight I found Belgrade-Chicago! I am satisfied with the price and other conditions that she offered me. I wish all the best to the Skyscanner company employees in the coming holidays and even better results! Merry Christmas from me and Happy New Year dear friends‚ù§Ô∏èüòá‚ù§Ô∏èüíï!!!
2023,2,"Basics missing. 1. There is no sync in estimated vs actual price. Shows 12k on calender but starts with 25k on actual results. Then while booking the flights, price moves to 30k. What's the point? 2. Why cant I filter our the direct flights on initial search, all aggregators give this basic option. 3. No option to filter out self transfer flights on app, such wierd & tacky flight combinations. 4. Price alert option is useless."
2023,5,"A great service delivered by a great App, plus, if you tell them about a bug, they get straight in touch, and fix it! Thanks Scott."
2023,5,Very good app in finding trip tickets at discounted rates and real time alerts when price drops. Life saver.
2023,5,"I have been happily and successfully using Skyscanners for over a decade now, simply because it is the best flight application available. Excellent. Many thanks."
2023,1,"I booked through make my trip a flight from dubai to cairo and due to emergency i was obliged to cancel my ticket and when i request a refund they inform me the my ticket is not Refundable. This total loss for me i trusted skyscanner agencies, and this really forced me to stop using skyscanner anymore."
2023,1,"Used to be the best app to find cheapest connection, now I cannot see prices in monthly view. Really bad decision to remove that function."
2023,5,A very useful platform for looking for flights tickets. Love using it because the platform has always been giving me a very good results.
2023,4,"Such a great app. But lately Skyscanner did not send me the updated price anymore through my email, which means I have to check manually. Can you please solve this problem. Thank you"
2023,5,really like this apps. easy to find the cheap tickets. every single minutes open to checking the which countries are cheap ticketüòÑ
2023,1,"WHY DOES THE WEEK START ON SUNDAY?! Why can't it be changed? So confusing, I almost booked the wrong dates because of that! I wrote about it a year ago and you told me you'd tell the development team - well, where is the change?"
2023,1,Terrible App.... Sack the development manager and team.... Plus anyone else who had anything to do with developing and testing of this useless piece of software and thought that it was fit for purpose and suitable for release.
2023,2,Has not been the same since they removed the cheapest flight search.....even with the new fly anytime search......not the same.
2023,5,"I love Skyscanner, it helps me find the best flight options, it's fast and free and finds connections Google Flights doesn't. Thank you for providing this service!"
2023,1,"You have been warrned Do not use online flight booking via Skyscanner/Travelist as they most likely double book your flight, charge you and then cancel your booking because it is double booked. It is over two months that I am trying to contact their customer service with no luck.I have sent numerous email and I keep getting automatic reply email that, they will respond within 7days but this is not true at all. I used the airline booking service directly without error, confident and informative"
2023,1,"I am giving 1 star to get some traction on feature requests. Can you please add a feature to blocklist a set of airlines, so that it doesn't show up in result? For example: I don't want to trips with China Airlines. Another feature is to have the ability to filter out flights with ""Self transfer"" requirements."
2023,1,Skyscanner works perfectly on my computer but I can't use it on my phone. Every time I want to edit the date of my return flight the app changes the first flight to the same date as the return!! It's maddening. Also my filters switch back to my previous choice so I need to adjust them again after every selection I get. I have to give 1 star to publish this otherwise it would be zero. Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro. On my Redmi Note 8 Pro every search stops near completion wth connection problems.
2023,2,"just downloaded it, and it's immediately so unhelpful. trying to explore flights from Atlanta to literally any airport in Mexico, and it says no flights available... seems to not work for trips longer than a week. renders the explore feature completely useless."
2023,1,"Used to love this app, Skyscanner was always my go to for flights. But now the site for flights is always down saying there's no Wi-Fi connection, but the rest of the app hotels ect works fine. It just won't budge and I don't understand why this happening. I will uninstall and go elsewhere if this carries on"
2023,4,There are several filter options missing. - need an option for global search (e.g UK to everywhere) along with outbound time and inbound time and same airport and direct flight option. ( all in one search - not by country ) contact me if you need more use case details
2023,1,Stopped working correctly. It will show the dates and prices but when I select those dates the prices are inaccurate and cost way more. Please fix this asap or I will delete the app and relay the problems to any friends using this app. If I choose a $41 departure flight and a $52 return flight the price shouldnt be $159. Get it together Devs!
2023,1,"My name is Priyanka, and today I booked a ticket for my friend through Happy Fares via Skyscanner. I am encountering difficulties as I have not received my ticket, and I am unable to check its status using the provided PNR number."
2023,5,Great app to use. lots of deals you jist need to look and try different locations and combinations.
2023,1,Seriously Disappointed! Rate fluctuating multiple searches causes price increase rigged system not showing the cost efficient options as pramoted! Really disappointing!
2023,5,"This application allows me to look for the cheapest places to go within a specific range of dates, this is across all airlines."
2023,2,"There are 2 service providers which make fool of people. BudgetTicket & Happyfares always shows lower prices, but when we go to book ticket suddenly price increases. Always facing same price increase issue with both service providers. Skyscanner is not taking any actions against these service providers."
2023,1,The new ui with tiles is pretty bad. The last version had the best ui with bigger pictures and bigger tiles. I wish I could dowgrade to the previous version. It was very smooth and user friendly.
2023,3,"Most partners are showing false information, while booking ,rate 90% will differ, sometimes flight as well."
2023,1,"Don't trust this app guys, my money was deducted but flight has not generate, even from the provider agency didnot responding for e-mails,calls. Plz don't choose these appüôè"
2023,2,Good app. Have found amazing deals on this app. But only reason I'm giving this a 2 star is bcs they keep working with BUDGET AIR. BA is a scam. They have scammed me and hundreds of others out of their money. Even if you buy the cancelation protection plan you will spend 5+hours on hold to be disconnected again and again. When you do talk to someone they'll tell you that they can't give you any money back even tho that's the whole point of the plan. This app would be better I'd they dropped them
2023,5,Always reliable and my first choice when it comes to searching for flights using it for years! Love the sleek and minimalistic interface. Keep it up!
2023,1,Cannot connect my earbuds. I tried everything on the manual and still cannot connect.
2023,1,when I booked the ticket through this app I was not delivered the air ticket by there partners so I would say it's worse app to use
2023,3,flights were confusing like only mention one stop / 2 stop but not telling where.. n not able to search hotel via using landmark
2023,3,Please add filter for airline loyalty programmes. I may want to see only one world flights for example.
2023,1,"Please and please, I'm urging Skyscanner to stop using Mytrip as an affiliate Travel Agency. They are fraudulent or rather scammers. They are always the first on the list to be displayed when it comes to booking because their charges are the cheapest but in reality, they are fraudsters! Please, stop displaying them as an affiliate travel agencies!"
2023,1,"WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHOW A LIVE PRICE FROM BEGINNING! The airfare prices at the beginning very rarely match the price once you get to the end. IF your method of how prices are published from start to finish are consistent all the way throughout the process you would have happy consumers. Eg. Explore (insert country name) price shows $309. Once you click to proceed price is then $338. Then click to providers, price is $362. To then use a reputable agent price is $400 plus extras."
2023,3,Needs a feature where you can filter on direct flights / number of stops at the beginning when you for example search for everywhere. Now you can only filter this when you have already a destination
2023,5,"easy and very convenience to use this application. Wherever our family fly , we use this apps."
2023,4,"Hey, nice app.. i like the option where you can choose ""everywhere"" as destination and check cheapest destinations from my country. I'd be happy if there is also an option from ""any departure"" to a certain destination. That would help me to see from which country/airport i can get cheap to my wish destination. As well it can be improved to chose several dates (not only whole month) but certain dates like from 7-15 July to a certain destination to check the prices"
2023,1,"Updated review, the app is about better now, but still loads of weaknesses in it. Looking for flights for October from Vienna to Malaga, the results shows 1 + stops, however luckily I know there are direct flights, then go in and you see the direct flights, pretty useless for anyone who wants direct flights as they may not know"
2023,4,"I suppose that it is the talre of the algorithm, but it is frustrating to have fees calculated in the currency of the country you are in when you search...but otherwise I'm very happy with Skyscanner"
2018,3,"The app would be perfect if it would be possible to have an option regarding luggages... I travel VERY often and most of time I have holded luggages with me... Now, as concurrence is big and every app is looking to show the cheapest prices, in 95% of cases, the showed price correspond to a price without credit card costs and with only a cabin luggage... Then the problem is that in many cases, it's simply impossible to add holded luggages as option. So, at the end, a waste of time and as result, a direct booking through the airline which makes, of course, Skyscanner ignore that a potential passenger used the site to find the best route, but booking it in a different way... Otherwise, finally the multiciity options is available! ...and it remains also the best app to find a flight..."
2021,1,"What's happened? I can't search anymore üòï I select ""flights"" and the last search is automatically coming up, and I get an error message when trying to enter new details (""looks like we lost you for a second - sorry seems our server dropped you off. Please try again later""). Really disappointed, this was my number 1 flight app for browsing deals, but now I can't even search for one destination üòî"
2020,2,Used to be really good until someone decided to change the layout and make something as simple as searching for a flight a nightmare! It's absolutely shocking now! I've no idea why you changed such a winning formula! Judging by all the other reivews neither does anyone else! Baffling that you thought this layout would be easier to navigate when realistically 2020 has been easier.. l will use other flight sites going forward
2018,3,"The explore features are a great idea, but don't work that well: when selecting ""Everywhere"" as destination, you cannot select ""weekends only"". And when you then click on a location and do apply the ""weekend"" filter, you still get flights departing on Fridays at 8AM. Sorry guys, but I've got a job and can't just browse off at 8AM! Would like a ""real weekend"" filter that goes from Friday evenings to Sunday evening (I also don't want to leave at 9AM on a Sunday...)."
2019,1,"This is the worst app I've used. I spent hours trying to book flights. I tried on phone and PC. One agency constantly says ""something went wrong - try new dates"" and the other agency takes me all the way to payment but payment never works. I rang one agency and they were quick to tell me I could pay over the phone but the price had gone up $400. On a previous booking I paid for seats in advance which were never provided. There is something up with all this. I have given up on Skyscanner."
2021,2,"Each iteration of Skyscanner's recent improvements across the various systems and devices makes it worse each time. It is a pain to use and I am going elsewhere, after about ten years of dedication to Skyscanner. Sorry it has become so bad. Honest, go back to the 'app' of say 2019 - then it was nice, simple, efficient, extremely helpful/useful and above all else easy to use, especially the choices of flights over a calendar month. Now that has gone. OVERALL, not even in the completion."
2021,5,"I have been using Skyscanner for a couple of years now. They have a great customer care team ready to help you if you are experiencing problems. The application is very easy to go through. You can actually get carried away when searching for flights in the app because it's so responsive to searches, which is great. Also, it works smoothly on every phone I switch to. I certainly recommend it. This is the app that every travel-enthusiast should have.. Thank you creators. Let's travel!!"
2019,4,Very good app overall to get a sense of prices and find a good deal. Filters help a lot to screen out nonsensical flights. But it would be very beneficial if one could select checked baggage and factor that into the price. Often times the prices don't match and I rarely travel with hand luggage only. Also a possibility to have a timeline graph of the changing prices would be informative.
2020,1,"Was perfect before but now unusable. I was easily able to search an entire month and see the best/direct fares for each day..now I am forced to go from one page to another per origin and destination and pick specific dates by click on in a button before waiting to see if there are any direct flights that day... very tacky. They keep replying to bad reviews saying they are constantly working to improve the app, but it's simple. Revert to the old one. A classic case of don't fix what isn't broken"
2018,2,"UX is disappointing.. I think it's trying too hard. Better focus on functionality. No matter how many times I try to search by specific dates I keep getting only random suggested dates returned for the next two weeks, one month, the months etc.. Suggestion: know your public! Most people tend to choose specific dates and don't have the liberty to search for any cross-hemisphere travel on random dates, as far as I am aware. Try putting as much effort into UX as seemingly goes into UI and that should get you a bit closer to a functional, maybe even happy use experience!! Good luck!"
2020,1,"I do love this app but the new interface is not good. Hard to understand how to select the from and where to locations, or HOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM (is it even possible still?) , hard to understand how to search for a one-way or round-trip, the dates selection is not intuitive at all... The entire month feature has been missed dearly for some times as well. I understand the will to try something new but here it's not intuitive, it frustrates and almost make no sense. Sorry but it's bad."
2021,1,"Why change something that worked so well. The New interface lacks the functionality of the past . Less options, for example Rent a car filters by pr√©f√©rences - less options. The air tickets booking is less convenient , the info presented lacks so many details that used to be on the old options. A classic example that it's so easy to destroy a well achieved accomplishment. If it works very well - don't touch , a golden rule. Bring back the old and steady app"
2021,1,"I do not like the new interface layout. All the separate bars to get into the selection of destination, date, departure, I'm missing the overview that the previous interface had. I'm also missing, the bar graph, the selection one-way vs. return, swapping arrival and departure destinations. Not connected to the new interface, but a function I'm missing since airlines started selling tickets without check-in baggage as standard, is an option to search for tickets including check-in bags."
2020,3,"Very disappointed with this update I'm afraid. I love sky scanner. I use it for half a dozen flights a year but will have to use desktop now.... Issue for me is the lack of filters on the initial search so the results come back with 200 or 300 options, most of them with multiple stopovers taking the 3 hour flight I'm looking for up to 35 hours of travel. Almost unusable in this format. Sorry guys."
2020,1,"Latest update is terrible. The possibility to choose flight or car disappear. You are forced to indicate your destination (based on the departure where you are, not always what I need), then the dates and to wait the search of the flight. Only after that, at the very bottom, you can choose to look for cars. Why?...I want to go directly to my needs on the home page!. Please, reload the previous version!. It was very very user friendly!!!"
2021,1,"Update: calendar view still doesn't work, and even worse - when you select whole month it shows the cheapest flight in that month, and flights in the next few weeks (from now). So I'm trying to book a flight in September and it only shows me one date. Where's the calendar view with prices? Also,'select month' doesn't always show. I want to see a calendar with prices for each day, irrespective of what I enter in departure and destination and dates selected. That. Was. The. Purpose. Of. This. App."
2021,1,"The app doesn't seem to work via WiFi, I had to switch to data which finally allowed me to select an airport. The prices quoted on the first screen are much cheaper than the real prices on the following screens. It offers you ridiculous multi stop flights first which make a 1 hour flight take over a day if this is a realistic option people want! The UI is hard to use now I've just given up with it. It's such a shame because this used to be a brilliant little app."
2022,1,"Installed the app after a few years of not being able to travel. I used to use it for all my flight search but I have to say I'm disappointed with the development choices made. The core reason for the app was how easy it was to use multiple inputs to help find the best flights, now I have to be way more specific (with dates and locations), which is simply not possible when trying to get to China (in my example). I need to be able to filter at the start on things (such as location of layover)"
2021,1,"What the heck did they do to this app in the last update??? It asks where I want to fly to Antalya from and will not change! I even tried resetting the app. Epic fail! I am resigned to using Google flights now. Edit: annoying that the from city box is under the white to city box. To search destination ""everywhere"" now you have to click on ""multi trip"" annoying too."
2019,1,"The new version of the app keeps wanting me to ""explore""; for example if I search flights for London (Any) to South Africa (Any) I get Capetown and Durban as trip options (No Johannesburg); you then get loads of information, reviews, hotels etc. All unnecessary when trying to book a flight home. I'm sure the old version of the app just gave a list of flights with a mix of airports - no fuss. Can't you keep it simple and have a separate section of the app for your ""explore function""?"
2022,4,"The app only displays prices in Chinese yuan and I can't find a way to change it. I'm in China it's probably detecting that, but I'm still an American and would be paying in dollars. Very annoying//edit: I added a star after finding the setting, but it's still bad design. Would have been easier to find if it was a gear icon like normal, and why is 'Your Details"" in it's own menu as it's all stuff typical of ""settings"". The UI is more cute than useful"
2020,1,The main reason i have been using your service for years is being able to check the prices for a whole month and also select options for nearby airports and now you seem to have taken these both away. Not only that but the app crashes every time i try and change the travel date. Really dissapointed to have to be writing this review. I hope these features are added again and the bugs are fixed becuase i can imagine alot of people will not be using your service anymore including me.
2020,1,"I agree with previous reviews of the latest update - It's AWFUL!! I often search flights for friends and family who aren't in the same city so I don't want it to assume I want to fly from my closest airport. I also like to plan ahead and want to type in future dates, not have to scroll through months and months of a calender. This was clearly not tested by actual travellers. I'd give it 0/5 if it was possible."
2021,1,"The old search interface is far much better than the new one. Now I can't swap between the origin and the destination easily but have to type both of them everytime I want to swap them. And now the search result are not show timetable of every airline on the top anymore. I have to read all the results and it make me very confused. I don't know why you have to change if it make the app getting worse. So, please bring back the old version."
2020,3,The new update is terrible. Can't input swop departure/arrival airports. Please put it back to how it was before this update! I have just been informed that the system has been changed. Thanks for that. I have tried a couple of different destinations/departure airports and it is easier. However it was still much simpler before the changes. I fell the customer has gained nothing.
2023,4,"Easy to use and helpful.Been using it for many years. Now it is a pain to use, just keeps revolving around previous searches with little indication to ""clear"" previous searches. Useless.latest updates have caused significant search functionality to be very time consuming with navigation just over the top. Not at all happy. Getting a big white screen with ""where to? with no further prompt to hit return ,or something else just leaves me in frustration.trying to pre-empt what one is looking for ."
2022,1,"Unhelpful and will only add to the cost of your travel. While they can hint at lower cost options, be warned that by booking via Skyscanner you are actually agreeing to them owning your booking. Should anything go wrong or change on your end, it is infact Skyscanner that will need to make the requests for change. This will lead to multiple phone calls, changing line managers that are unable to help, no two way communication on updates, and most importantly no ownership on a resolution. Be warned"
2021,1,"The re-design of the app is a total failure, not sure if anyone made any research into thia but everything in the app basically takes twice or 3 timea as many steps and you get useless loads in between. If you want to find a direct one-way flight, the best way to do it is to use any other app basically. Very dissatisfied as the app used to be so simple to use and straight to the point."
2020,1,"I have enjoyed the app for a long time until the recent interface update. It is very counter intuitive and hard to navigate. It took me a long time to find a 'multicity' option, and when I did, I can find no way to save flights and trips. I now use the Kayak app, which is clear and has more functionality."
2019,5,"Edit: Just find out I can choose a country (in my case Italy) and the app provides me all possible solutions for the airports in that country. PREVIOUS REV: Great app, but add the possibility to search from (and to) more than one airport in different cities. For example, I can choose between two or more airports in different cities nearby. At the moment I have to search manually. You already do with multiple airports in a city like new York. So, please do it also with airports in different city."
2023,4,"When going to the website of the best provider to buy the flight ticket, it is better to take it to the genuine and trusted side. Happy Fire, Qiwi, Chief Ticket.in, Budget Ticket, Flight Mojo, Akbar Travel, Goto Gate, Flight Network, it is better not to take it to the fake side. These side payments will be done but they don't send tickets. but easy my trip,goibibo,cleartrip,yatra,is genuine and trusted side"
2020,2,This app is so bad since the new look. Used to just be able to see all the flights you had an eye on and price change alerts at a glance if you clicked to receive the notification. Now you've got to search through a list of trips at the bottom that are impossible to remove to find the destination you've been looking at. Doesn't scroll to the bottom of the list of dates for each destination properly. Really poor. Don't how this create a trip thing works either. Is that going to save me?
2022,1,"It used to be a great app and service overall. I have no idea what happened, but now it's just so confusing and unhelpful. The feature to see prices on the calendar is great - except it never works and when I search, there is no flight for such price. And sometimes, it doesn't even find the flight at all. It is so confusing. I was searching for a flight on skyscanner for like 15 minutes, then I opened kiwi and within 2 minutes, I found a suitable flight. What happened, skyscanner?"
2021,2,What has happened?! Pre-COVID I used to live on this app. Was 5 stars. So easy to find the best option. As the world very slowly starts to open up again I come back to my old friend Skyscanner and everything has changed! Gone is the ability to search +/- 3 days. Feel like time has been turned back 5 years. Why change something that worked so well? :(
2023,5,I love to travel and browsing with Sky Scanner has found me incredible bargains including international flights ..
2021,3,"Omg. This is the weirdest UX solution. Yes, they have Month view which has been missed by everyone. But it's not right where you expect it to be, smth like a tumbler in the Dates section when you choose a flight. No, you must scroll down the main page, there will be Month view. By default it has return flight. If you don't need it, you might want to find how to switch to the one-way mode, and it's not that easy. I'll continue to use skyscanner with a web browser on my phone, thank you."
2023,1,"They broke ""explore everywhere"" feature. It searches only next month."
2023,3,"It's good app, but whenever i search hotels and sort by prices low to how the app stops working and exits by itself"
2019,2,"I am really disappointed with the latest iteration of the app. It used to be superb, but is now trying to be too smart and has lost a lot of the functionality. I usually am trying to find flights for me and my family, but can't see where to change the number of passengers until after flights are chosen. Also, it only tells the cheapest flight in any given month, rather than indicating cheaper and more expensive days to help inform choices. Please get this sorted as it's currently no good."
2020,1,"Can you please recommend another flight app company to use , cause with this update you have destroyed Sky Scanner. You managed to make this the most difficult to use app. It is so frustrating to use , i want to pull out my hair. No more calender view , more steps to select cities , difficult to chose only direct flights. It is just a mess. How do you come up with this , seems your development team lost touch with user and have no idea what they doing. You ruined somthing that was working well."
2022,1,You can't search for flights with a +/- a few days range which would be simple to add. The travel time toggle is utterly reduntant and unhelpful. A wider search of 'nearby' airports would help a lot too. Also the app keeps losing my 'hearted'/saved flights meaning I had to do the search all over again numerous times. When it does save and I go to view a saved flight it says 'not enough tickets' even though it clearly shows as still available on my desktop computer.
2021,1,"Pathetic usibility of the app. I being a developer myself found app to be extremely difficult to navigate, search flight change dates etc. It used to be one of the best apps on terms of usibility but now its just shambolic. I can't easily search a flight but destination etc. You don't need to make a fancy interface to make the best usable app. Please take bits out of old interface."
2023,5,i like skyscanner for uou can find here all schedule that suits your need.not to mention that tocket here is more cheaper than other apps
2019,3,"I mainly use this app to find the cheapest weekend to visit a city on my travel list. It works really well on the iPhone where you can select your destination, filter for weekends, and then browse for the best flight up to almkst a year in advance. On an android you can only browse up to 3 months in advance - at which point prices are higher. If you use it the way I do, you're better off using Google flights or a different app."
2023,5,very good search engine that does an incredibly great job at going trough most other airline app like Priceline etc to find you best deals
2021,1,"This app used to be great, why changing something very easy to use and to understand with great features for something awful and so hard to have access to find a simple flight. Very disappointed with the interface and what it is now. Took me 10min to figure out how to pick a return flight. Have to go to another company till this one is sorted and user friendly"
2019,5,"Easy to select destination and if you're not sure which dates, select the whole month and you can see prices on dates and work out the cheapest departure & return. A good selection of flights come up for the dates so you can choose what suits. I've done it before, got great flight times to make the most of my holiday at great flight prices! You can also ""star"" them, so you can go back at a later date and book if required. 5* from me!"
2023,4,Great app only issue I have is not allowing me to log in having the same issue for two weeks now.
2021,1,Unfortunately have to echo all the recent negative reviews. This new update is a disaster. I simply want to search for a flight to a defined city during a defined date. When I enter the city it tells me about just the next month which I am not interested in and it is so difficult to find the screen where I can enter dates. Skyscanners best feature of comparing prices across time also seems to be gone. Who oked this update?
2019,1,"Terrible app (doesn't compare to the website) I really hate the Sky scanner app. I have tried to use it so many times (often using the website and having a good experience) and every time I leave frustrated. It doesn't let you select the whole month to find the cheapest flight, which to me is the only thing that makes skyscanner better than other flight compare sites/apps. I also find it shows me less options, and often more expensive than the skyscanner website, which is just weird."
2020,2,"Skyscanner used to be great. Now it's very slow. Also if I search for fights with 2 adults and 2 children to somewhere that is not a listed destination, it then goes to a new screen where I have to select flights, again, and it forgets that is for 2 adults and 2 children and finds flights for a single traveler. Even if you click on a selection you can't add note passengers and redo the search."
2023,5,"An excellent app, I have ever found!! I should refer this app to everyone I like. Thanks Skyscanner."
2019,3,"The new visual update is very basic looking, logo is a smart idea but looks basic. No share button to allow you to share hotels to friends or family to view before booking. Having to take a screenshots that do not attach a link is not ideal. Also not having the option to favourite hotels to look back through at an easy glance is also not ideal."
2020,1,The original site and app were essentially the 'Google' of searching for a flight. The new updated interface essentially turns this app into something akin to Yahoo or Bing. The interface is honestly terrible. It may look clean but loses much of the functionality with made skyscanner so useful e.g. booking a flight package to multiple cities (so not just a simple return trip the the same city you landed in). Very little thought has gone into this update.
2019,3,"What was once a simple app is becoming cluttered and unituive. People that use this model want simplicity and value speed but now theres too much going on. When searching, what has happened to searching for a whole month and when using explore to search for a whole month, you don't get a calendar to choose from but a list of already selected flights. The whole reason I use skyscanner is to see that calendar view to choose specific dates and compare."
2020,5,"I loved it, now I hate it since the last update. It's unclear, unusable, difficult to navigate. The old app was awesome, the new is a disaster. It lacks all benefits of the old app. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE???? Multi city search and month price view are gone, and so are many other features a frequent flyer needs. Go back to the old app asap, your app developers got it sooo wrong for the sake of just developing !!!! I Edit 03-09. All features all back. Thank you!!!!!"
2019,2,"Why make an app that is worse than the website? I don't see prices in the calender overview, there is no option for cheapest month and whole month, I cannot find my price alerts and the worst: when I change to another app and back, the app reloads, my search is gone and not even in the history.. very annoying. I like the interface and it's nice that you can share the flight easily, for that I give a second star."
2022,1,"Used to be brilliant. The app let the user find the most suitable way to get to a destination. It doesn't do that anymore, so now it's pretty much useless. You can only filter down for direct flights after searching for specific days - then none are direct. No obvious way to search months without putting the dates in. No way to visually see the typical prices for that route at that time (the old bar chart view). Return flights vanish when you select an outbound date. Disappointing."
2019,2,"Used to really like this app, however it seems to get worse with every update, latest one being you can no longer save flights, only create price alerts. Edit: star seems to have changed to a heart, option to save comes up on some flights, but not all, especially when trying to select flight times for an airline that does multiple flights per day to a destination."
2023,2,"Makes things harder than they need to be. Will tell you a price for a date, but that price will fail to be there when you click on it. On first screen the flight might be ¬£330 one stop, the second ¬£290 one stop, before finally ¬£500 2 stops. Lets you select a date but most screen space is showing other useless dates. Very frustrating. You're looking at a flight in April? If you left next week it would be ¬£250 cheaper! Brilliant, why didn't I think of having my Easter holiday next week, cheers"
2022,1,"Used to a very good app but now slow and inconsistent. Tracks your searches and raises the price when searching the same flight a few days later. The worst feature is that in the last 3 years, I have NEVER got the flight for the initially advertised price. It's ALWAYS more expensive, and in many cases significantly more expensive"
2020,1,"The website and app are not great I'm afraid. All I want to find out is the cheapest day to fly Zante. After pulling my hair out I finally found a month view to get some daft traffic light system which doesn't even show the price until you search. You also need to search one airport at a time! Surely it didnt used to be this bad, otherwise would have never booked through you. Uninstalled and now looking for other price comparison websites. üôÑ"
2023,2,"It used to be great, but now the searching options are not functional at all...I can't select destination ""everywhere"" with direct flights Only. You need to set up the dates and choose the destination first, and only Then you can filter by direct flights only...Complete waste of time tbh! Plus the fact it always remembers my first destnation and date search, which is annoying."
2019,1,"Always changes prices, tracks your searches and makes it more expensive every search. Can use other websites to search and confirm prices. One search a return flight was estimated from 150 dollars once clicked it when up to a minimum of 10k dollars. New app design makes it more difficult to navigate. Will use something like kayak from now on. Don't waste your time searching and researching with this app."
2021,1,"If there is a ""O"" option to select along with the stars.. I would have given that. Why..what happened to the UI. One of the worst ever UI seen in travel industries. If there is chance to revert to old UI.. I suggest you to do that ASAP before the users uninstall this. Luckly there is no travelling thus this App is still installed on many phones..!"
2022,4,"Thanks for providing this awesome service. 2 massive improvements that I think could be made to improve the experience are: 1 - When using the explore feature and selecting the whole month, to be able to select one month for departure and another month for return and not only be limited to one month for both; 2 - Create a map for the explore feature (similar to Ryanair's discovery feature)."
2019,1,"I would use the website even from my phone. I don't like the way the flight options are displayed in this app anymore. Visually, it is more difficult for me to catch all of the information I need to make a decision. The website is better, it has the skyscanner style on the way the list of flights are presented, the app now is looking a lot like last minute flights app which I don't use exactly because of the way the list of flights is presented, ugly and plain."
2020,4,"So i have a new phone... When you first install the app, you don't get that screen on first use. You are offered the opportunity to set up an account (which i skipped) then you get a ""where do you want to go"" screen with no option to tap search, then flights. Only by closing the app and reopening does dialog as you describe it get presented. Maybe you need to rethink the after install use cases?"
2023,1,"ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ ÿ≥ÿ¶ Ÿàÿßÿ∫ŸÑÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÑŸä ŸÅŸäŸá ÿπÿ±Ÿàÿ∂ ŸÉÿßÿ∞ÿ®ÿ©. ÿ™ÿØÿÆŸÑ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸä ÿπÿ±ÿ∂ ÿ≥ÿπÿ± ŸàŸäÿ™ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÑÿßÿπÿ® ŸÅŸäŸÉ. how does the app give access to these poor travel agencies? just showing offers from partners, then you go there to partner page to have minapolated fake offers. how I rate the travel partners in the app after experience."
2019,3,"The app seems to have updated, it takes a lot more steps to get to the list of flights now. I start with 2 passengers and by the time I get to the list of flights its only saying the price for 1 passenger. I have to manually change back to two when I select a flight. The new update made things more complicated than they used to be and a little bit frustrating."
2021,2,"The app works just fine, but 1 star deducted for each of below: 1) searching by country, the prices shown at the 'city' level vs actual prices are vastly different 2) no option to search by ranges (many other app does support it) which makes it very tiresome to search the best options 3) for some cities with more than 1 airport (e.g. Warsaw) you cannot search by city, but only a specific airport even though they are both within 40min drive from the city centre... Takes 2x more time to search"
2023,1,"I used to love this app for many years. Now when I search for the flights it shows wrong prices & when I open the flights theyre always more expensive and more often than not with a transfer. Why is it possible to apply 'only direct flights, filter only after I click on specific dates. For me, ditect flights comes before everything else. For me personally it has become genuinely unusable, combined with prices being always way off, its time to delete this app."
2021,3,Could be better if the 'Explore everywhere' option allowed you to show/filter for direct flights so i can see what places i can get to in shortest possible journey times from my local airport. Currently only when you select one of the presented destinations do you discover that it can only be reached via multiple stops so would be good to filter those out.
2023,5,Adding a section of travel planner with locations and their destinations will be phenomenal.
2023,5,Exceptional App But day wise the rate of flight is not appearing in the calendar for some of the months
2023,1,Date search has become really bad. ONLY overpriced flights. Now under CHINESE ownership - reason to uninstall this SPYWARE!!!
2019,1,"I don't use this app frequently, maybe two-three times per year, so I was shocked how it was changed. For me it is confusing and sometimes annoying and not functional anymore. Please bring back the old visualization where the timeline was horizontal and ticket prices were vertical, so I could really optimize price and date at the same time. Now I have to select where to go and when, and application will send me a price alert if cheaper price will be available. It doesn't help a lot."
2023,1,"U guys must learn from make my trip, where will I get my ticket pdf if I wanted it again. In plan ur trip , u can easily add tickets booked, and so on......"
2019,1,This has been my go to app for many many years. However this latest update is just incredibly and unnecessarily difficult to navigate. I'm going to try the website and hope for better but it's a shame as I've uninstalled the app. What annoyed me most was the fact you're forced to click buttons and cannot use app in sections like it used to. Change for the worse and I hope it gets an update soon as I have a lot of faith in the Skyscanner brand that wont be shaken by one awful update.
2022,1,"I hate to have to leave a bad review. Used to be a 5 star app. I used to use this app monthly and it was great. Now it seems as though it can never find flights. Direct flights apparently dont exist. Yet if you search the exact same criteria direct with the airline, they come up straight away. Not sure what's happened to the app since the pandemic hit, but covid can't be an excuse. It just doesn't find the info it used to."
2023,5,the best best app for travel. only flight to dubai are missing ex mumbai some bug
2023,5,The best place to book tickets! Easy to use and trustful üíúüíúüíú
2023,5,"excellent site for flight options, highly recommend for frequent flyers"
2023,1,Fraud from skyscanner and cleartrip. Payment done but no tickets received They are scamstars
2020,1,"Booked a flight, paid, few hours later received a email with notice of my cancellation witch I did not do. Do not use this app or any company associated with it I'm out couple of thousand for nothing and all they tell me is, my money will be refunded back to me in the next couple of days but I need to fly before that. Very very bad service from their side!!!!!!!!! Outrageous!!!!!!"
2021,1,"This new look is sooo confusing! Plus, who came up with the idea with the automatic search, the worst new implementation i have ever seen! No, let your customer think and decide, click around, not search automatically for flights, makes your customers not want to use your app:( Your Product Manager is not connected very well with your customers. I never post negative reviews, but your app beated all other screws up buy a long mile, so disappointing"
2019,3,"The app is OK but please add the option for fly out and back from the same airport on the android app. Being in London it's a pain having to do the searches by each individual London airport to get only the results out and back from same airport, which drives me to just search on the airlines websites instead. That function is already there on the website so no idea why it isn't on the app."
2023,5,very helpful and quick to navigate.
2020,1,"Really enjoyed using this app. But now its awful . Its trying to be to much, app was perfect to navigate and was just about flights, now its got hotels, car hire. Removing the graph for looking at flights is poor. Now i have to search each date individually. I have read reviews about its because of covid-19, don't believe it as covid-19 has been happening since January and only recently removed the graph. Will this review and all the 1 star reviews change this app for the better. We will see."
2021,2,I used Skyscanner's own agency to book as the airline agent wouldn't. The pros are the app experience and prompt customer support replies. The bad points apply to pretty much all online travel agents. The upfront fare in my case was slightly less but there's an extra $85 change and cancellation fee per request on top of everything the airline might charge. Even my hefty credit card fee wasn't refunded. Do not use this service during an uncertain period like this pandemic that's for sure.
2018,1,"I was using this app for flight booking as if there were no other apps. I never used any other app for the flight search or booking. Now, I know there exists apps like farefirst which helps book a flight work in a much better way, I switched from skyscanner to farefirst. Also Skyscanner is filled with ads whereas here as the other app is ad free, provides only relevant information via notification. Both the apps are used to search, compare, book flights. Farefirst does this is a most ideal way I guess. They list purely based on price. There are no tricks involved."
2022,4,Skyscanner can be a very useful tool for one who is doing some well needed research for their next airfare. Not all airlines are represented so one must be sure to look at the missing options. Both listed and unlisted options must be checked against the actual carriers own website to be sure. Great platform to get a guide on pricing.
2023,1,"Decent app but some companies Skyscanner chooses to recommend to you are just criminals. For example, Etraveli Group (mytrip) kept 30% of a refund they were given by LOT Polish airlines when my flight was cancelled and claimed it was their ""administration fee"". EU law requires a refund of ""the full cost of the ticket at the price at which it was bought"" but Etraveli don't care about that and Skyscanner are happy to keep recommending Etraveli. Now I just book direct with airlines."
2021,1,"Horrible new interface!! Wow, this used to be the perfect app and so easy to use just a few weeks ago. Whoever decided on this new interface should be fired immediately. Much harder to use, they literally made it harder to use and less important information offered and offered nothing good in return. I'm deleting it immediately and switching to momondo."
2021,1,"Really started to suck. Since h√¥tel and car have been added, flights interface became messy and mobile app a real pain to use. Moving to a new app. Fix what you did best, flights. 2021, still no change and we were talking about that with friends today again. How come the UX is still so complicated now for flights Changing departure city and destination couldn't be more inefficient"
2023,5,sky scanner gives the best prices available at lowest possible rates
2022,5,Best flight app I've used. I love how the whole app works and is designed its super user friendly and clear. Best feature for me is if im unsure but I know I want to get away in the next few months it's so easy to find a holiday anywhere within that time frame with costs etc. I browse it regularly just to see what they recommend as well as some flights are cheaper than a tank of petrol. Excellent stuff!
2023,5,awesome app. book the cheapest airline tickets here.
2023,5,All time best app for flight searching. I wish I could rate more than 5üåü.
2023,1,Amount deducted from the account but ticket not delivered and there is no help line number for further assistance
2023,1,On the date the price is less as I click the dates the price goes 3 times up not fair
2023,4,Great app. Honestly it provide you best deals. Never disappoints.
2023,2,"The app is so limited and cumbersome compared to the website, it's really not worth using."
2023,5,Best app of all time it's saves lots of time and money
2023,2,the timings and cost in Skyscanner app is not matching with actual sites.
2023,1,"some booking sites they shows like ""budgetticket booking""is totally scam. Deducted my money and provided wrong false PNR. dont trust this siteThis is the ticket they have send me. But at the official site of Spicejet there is no record of the PNR booking not even our name is showing. I called spicejet representative and they told PNR and booking no is false and invalid.Being a good reputaion of your company you should  verify the authenticity of ""Budgetticket"" website. This is disgusting and wil"
2023,4,"very convenient and easily accessible, also user friendly"
2023,5,"it's a very good app, very helpful to find multiple options"
2023,1,A simple search doesn't work. Use Google flight
2023,5,Very informative and helpful up dates.
2022,1,"Unable to choose and airport and the ""everywhere"" option without also selecting ""direct only"" which is completely useless as technically I can get literally anywhere if I'm prepared to fly for 97 hours and take 7 different planes. Prices under the heading ""everywhere"" are wildly inaccurate also. Finally this app would be far more useful in Europe if I could exclude the UK from searches due to visa issues."
2023,1,"Piece of garbage. I'm deleting it immediately. Sends me price alerts that are twice the cost, and then when I try to adjust the settings, it doesn't even show they exist. Cant put a price alert for a range of dates, and if you can, doesn't explain how"
2023,1,I needed a flight from Asheville NC to Springfield I'll. I changed my departure and arrival times 6 times. All for January 2024. Confirm....NO flights! Give me a break folks no flight anywhere in the month of Janary? With me changing times dates. Rd trip or with stops. I looked at what flight were available a few days ago without any aps. and found flights. But not with sky scanner. My son told me try sky scanner that's exactly what i did. No flights for the entire month of January.
2021,1,Not good. Terrible would be a better way to describe it. Even the website which I've always preferred for simple flight searches has turned into a nightmare to use. Hence trying this awful app again. Best to just stick with the actual tour operators individually from now on. A lot less confusing
2022,1,"I switched phones and I'm unable to log into my account in new phone. When I click log in and add my email address, the app asks me to go to login as the email address is registeredüôÑ. I tried logging into the website directly and it gives the error something went wrong. I emailed their support about it with screen recording of the error along with screenshots and they just kept asking me to log in. After explaining 3-4 times over email I gave up. I liked the app a lot before the error."
2019,2,"Not bad per se, but unlike the website I can't seem to find the option to fly out & back using the same airport. I'm not sure why this isn't the default option anyway, with the option instead being to select using different airports for out & back - would've thought that was more useful to most people? Without that it made the app quite useless for me, so I've uninstalled."
2020,3,"I would've given 5 stars previously, but with the new update I cannot see the bar graph with price for different days which was really useful for me to pick the best price. Please bring that back! Otherwise I booked my whole Europe trip here which was fantastic and also booked Korea which was refunded with no issues when COVID hit."
2023,5,One of the best Apps with remarkable recommendations of affordable and classy itinerary
2023,2,"Great app overall, but I was almost about to book a flight and didn't realise I had a one hour stopover and had to change to another terminal at the airport in the said time. Wouldn't have found out at all until I booked the ticket. It would be a great feature if the developers decided to add which terminal the flight is from and which terminal the flight lands to. Cheers."
2023,5,Hotels rates shown is not d same after clicking.....
2022,1,"This app is awful. Filters reset everytime you go back a screen. Selected direct flights only? Tough it resets to all. Trying to use explore to get all the flights listed for a month, it will only show the cheapest match, then the next week, the next month etc . I want the whole month of flights I selected, why is it showing me this useless info? Really desperately needs a feature review"
2022,2,"Kind of pointless. I like Skyscanner, especially because I can search 'nearby' airports. This feature isn't available in the App, as far as I can see. However, the mobile optimised (responsive) website is nicely presented and has all the features. It really makes the App redundant in my experience."
2020,2,"It is a great App but I am missing a great feature: I cannot block some destination to avoid the app looking for trips with stops in countries where I need a visa. For example, now with the quarantine restrictions, several countries does not allow flying stops. So I think it would be great to have this option available."
2021,2,"What have you done to the app? The flight search functionality is awful and very unintuitive. It used to be so simple. Changing from single/return flights, removing Direct only etc seems impossible. I have always used this app but it's taken a turn for the worse and will look at alternatives."
2020,1,Utterly unusable. You cannot enter your starting location if it is different from your actual location. The old app was so easy. With this one it took me 10 minutes to try to book a flight from London to Cambodia when I am already in Cambodia. I was looking at prices for a friend in the UK. I gave up before finding a price. Never going to use skyscanner again. Utter rubbish app. Uninstalled.
2019,3,"Decent app but doesn't have the full searching capabilities of the mobile website. Please also add (to the app and/or the full website) the functionality of selecting ""everywhere"" as the departure location not just the destination location - would be so useful as you could then combine cheap flights to create an even cheaper fare."
2023,2,found a great price with Cebu Pacific but can't load the payment page regardless of how many attempts I made
2023,5,"Can't think of another app, except maybe one, that's as efficient, easy and effective as Skyscanner. Looking fwd to seeing more new functions."
2023,1,"skyscanner and travelis agent: unresponsible , non informative , full of error in reservation system.. My husband and I reserved two tickets from skyscanner and travelis agent at 26/7 they issued ticket for my husband and not for me inspite of paying .Their online support give reply to questions 7 days later and they will not response to call for half of day ,we had to take 2 tickets from turkish airline agent again without any problem. They haven't accepted their fault or refund our money yet."
2023,1,"Lies upon lies. The price is never like the show it, it changes within minutes, the day by day approximations are different, or the price becomes more when actually buying, and the currency exchange is always off. I can't trust it at all."
2023,1,"I can't booking for domestic because Agoda agency is required passport no., but actually if directly booking with Agoda app isn't required. I would like to know why they need."
2023,1,"While searching for flights, it showed 3 and options for another 41 flights were there. On clicking that futher options, the server isn't responding at all."
2023,1,"Has to set filter for every date, then why there is filters! 20 date 20 times set filter, stupid app. It should be 1 time filter, then go for every page."
2023,2,"cons: price change during search, lack of option to display flights on requested day from airport ( timetable) very different experience between pc and android. pros: It is doing its job"
2023,1,They aggregate fares from a 3rd party called Flights Channel which is a bait and switch website. Google it. They essentially show low cost airfares that don't exist and when you book you end up paying a lot more. Seriously a scam and please google it. Skyscanner should cut ties with Flights Channel as it illegitimate.
2023,1,After recent update all the websites are showing same price to book..earlier skyscanner was the best. Looking for alternatives now when the prices are same everywhere why to book from here
2021,1,"For example, I would choose Berlin as departure point the app would then show that I have to fly from Berlin to Vienna and then change to the plane that takes me to my destination. When I choose the Vienna airport mentioned however as departure point, it doesn't show any flights I have seen when I had chosen Berlin. Something is terribly wrong with the app."
2022,1,"I do like Skyscanner and find it helpful most of the time, however, there is a frustrating bug I have reported previously but is still occuring. When on ""Explore Everywhere"" and selecting a specific airport (LGW in my case), then picking a country, then airport, then flight/price, the majority are from other airports, as somehow the system resents to ""(all) London airports"" I hope the developers can resolve this promptly."
2023,1,"Its an awful site, once you start looking for your flight the next half an hour the price will increase drastically. Another greedy awful site that loves to scam everyone it can."
2022,1,"Gives you an acceptable price, and then when you go to check out and enter all info, you get prompted with a ""the price has increased"" message. Tried 3 different flights and it happened every single time as soon as the cc info was entered. Yes prices change but an increase within minutes (3-4 mins) that it takes to fill in the form. And not for 1 but 3 of 3 attempts...and ofcourse its never a decrease - only an increase - no thanks"
2023,1,App doesn't work. Crashes at the point of inputting departure location and doesn't recognize internet connection or location.
2023,5,Best Apps it's very cheap and Best flights show
2023,2,App doesn't send you the details And later you should speak with airlines and find out. It should be so simple to get instructors.
2020,1,Not to be trusted. Following a very bad experience from making a booking on Skyscanner I have deleted the app. I don't trust Skyscanner or the cowboy travel agents vying for business. They have my hard earned money for a long saved for family holiday...and are so leisurely in their responses... Even obtrusive. Never again. I will happily pay more next time to get better customer service.
2023,3,"It's a nice and useful app, but it's totally not cool that they started to spam me like crazy with emails after the signup."
2018,3,Only users that have used sky scanner for a few years know what a let down this app now is. I install & uninstall almost immediately at regular intervals hoping in vain they may change it back to the simple to use fantastic flight search engine it used to be. I search for flights almost everyday & it really pains me that I have to use the less appealing desktop version ..
2022,1,"This used to be such a good app. Ive been using Skyscanner since 2003, well before apps were a thing. Now that travel is back open I started using it again. Where is the amazing explore section with a choice of weekend breaks and fantastic destination deals?!! Why is it so clumsy and obtuse to use. So sad. Its basically just another disappointing app. AND it's so ugly to use view now!"
2021,2,"Not as good as the website. UI certainly looks nice but that's useless if the UX suffers. It's too minimalist, can't find what I need to. That is, the whole month search (which specifically shows you which days are cheapest to fly) which sky scanner is actually useful for."
2023,5,"Excellent app for finding, very cheap and good flights. Skyscanner is name to be trusted beyond any doubt."
2022,1,"Its fiddly, and its not simple to just select direct flights only. I want a view of all the direct flights over the course of an entire month but for some reason I don't have those options when searching using the app. I dont want to have to guess some dates either and then apply filters because it's a waste of time. Its just better to go to the website."
2021,1,"Trying to rent a car I read all the details and all the provided documents. It resulted this intermediary withdraws (or MAY withdraw but it's not clear to me what prevents them from doing it) a $1500 security deposit no matter what the terms and conditions of your final renting company will say. This sum will not include the rental cost or any insurance fees you will pay to the actual rental company. Are you sure you still wanna rent a car through this app? Be careful, the terms and conditions are available via a link on the very last ""page"", after you provide your personal details and almost confirm you agree with everything... :)"
2020,1,"The Skyscanner website was my bible, I was a frequent user and undoubtedly the main reason was the search feature. The ability to be able to search for flights anywhere from a certain airport and select any month and show the cheapest month was brilliant. The fact you are preventing me from using the mobile website and trying to force me onto an app, which doesn't allow to search by months hurts my soul. Please fix the app and make it better but also allow us to use the mobile website again."
2021,1,"This update is a complete disaster. Gone is type of aircraft used on selected route. Only top flight option opens. As often as not, price choice will not open. If you want to keep me and probably thousands of others, if you do need to update your app, at least keep the key elements of flight selection."
2020,1,"Terrible app on a mobile phone, text overlapping and filtering is hard to navigate, especially when trying to look at monthly flights. Overall very poor in comparison to the actual website. The whole app GUI needs completely overhauled. Uninstalled & now using the website. Also, judging by other reviews, Skyscanner aren't listening to customers."
2023,2,"With the latest updates this app is not like before. I used it for years but in the last time, many flights are missing, it became difficult to look for flexible days for flights. Now it works more on ""recommendations. Use website without app, it works better. But I have better alternative apps so I'm out."
2023,1,"They have a tie up with such websites like happy fares, who provides wrong information to customers and charge a wrong cancellation fee to customers and skyscannner takes no action, so i strongly suggest kindly avoid skyscanner and happy fares for any of your bookings."
2023,1,"The app is good to find lowest price to desired destination. But search API gets exhausted very quickly. If we search 2-3 nearby airports, search result is just ""Oops, something went wrong"". Seems app is not properly tested for performance, out-of-box scenarios. Otherwise, this app could have potential to take place everyone's devices."
2019,1,The app is all about deceivingly cheap offers that don't exist. Only $139 to Cambodia! But when you dive in the cheapest return flight is $1000 more! It never happened that the real price equalled to the highlighted offer on the front page. It's all about tempting and bluffing with Circe-like songs. Once Skyscanner was THE place for finding cheapest flights but this is no more so. Today the best offers are once again on airline own sites.
2022,1,"Contacted support team as was suggested here. Unfortunately it didn't solve anything, the support team stopped answering after the first answer. Original review: It used to be a great app but starting from some day it's been just constantly showing me ""No flights found for this route"" despite the fact that there're plenty of options on the airlines websites and on the apps of the competitors (e.g. Aviasales)."
2019,3,"Great comparison use for flights and gaging estimate cost with minimal luggage. But i rarely book on the app. There needs to be a luggage filter (baggage allowance - e.g airlines providing 2 bags at 23kg on long haul!) I just use the site initially to discover the two airlines to book on their sites independently. It is annoying, especially because i use it for long haul so there's always 2 airlines - a stopover for connecting. A faff. Please make a baggage allowance filter on next app update!"
2023,1,could not pay for flights error message occurred
2023,2,"The app used to work fine till 1st week of April 2023, but since two weeks the destination and origin (where to and where from) is unable to select, doesn't matter how many times I re-install the app, it didn't work for the mobile app. Even in support section this is the only solution mentioned to fix any problem related to mobile skyscanner app. Hence uninstalling it"
2019,2,"Great app at what it does but with some serious bugs too. I tried logging in. Eventhough the method was unusual, where you are redirected to a browser to login afresh instead of going through the Google accounts registered in the phone, the app here lagging right after that. Also, I can't create alert notification for flight prices. It shows a toast saying unable to create the price alert. After this, I'm automatically logged out. Tried it multiple times with no luck."
2020,1,"I've used skyscanner for years but won't be using it again since their latest update has taken away the only aspects which made it worthwhile. Explore function and search by cheapest month were the only things putting skyscanner ahead of its competitors, I have no idea what would possess them to get rid of these features. Terrible decision."
2019,1,"Skyscanner used to be my one stop solution for all flight booking needs (and I'm a frequent traveler). But has become appallingly bad in the last few months. Different fares on Skyscanner and booking site, flights no longer available after having me fill in all personal and payment info. I'll be uninstalling the app and moving to another platform."
2022,1,Shyscanner or Skyscammer? My flight bookings were cancelled and I didn't get the money back in full. I paid with a European Visa card. Money was transferred back the next day but there was a discrepancy of 18 Euros. Out of courtesy I would have expected to get at least a voucher because I had nothing to do with the cancellation. On top of that I had to set up an account with XCover to get the money back for the insurance I booked. Altogether it took me a month and many hours of emailing....
2018,3,"Not happy, I love Skyscanner website it's always my go to website for cheap flight tickets and thus finally I downloaded the app for mobile but it was disappointing as I couldn't search for multi journey flights in the app which you can do on website. Not sure which other features/functions are missing, but would really appreciate that these basic features which are already available on website to be replicated in the app. Thanks."
2021,5,"Love the live map of the travel restrictions and criterias!!! Makes it so convenient to see what's happening. Didnt know in some countries, quarantine is not necessary anymore! Anyway been using this app for yearssss pre-COVID19 and its amazing. Always getting really good flight deals with such an eady interface. Can't wait for some normalcy to return."
2019,2,"This app used to be excellent but has taken backward leaps with each update it seems. The graphing function was fantastic & would show you the cheapest & most expensive Flights if you had this luxury of choice, but now it just shows magnifying glass/search icon, which is quite annoying & time consuming! Please bring back this function instead of it saying 'no data available'"
2020,1,"Used to be fantastic, now useless! I have been using this app to book my flights for years, never seems to find the cheap flights anymore... just proved it, found a ¬£44 flight, was brousing Sky Scanner for a better flight/deal, same day/same flight and it was showing at ¬£143...I realise that once I started to book, the proper price would have been charged, but how can you find a bargain if the app is ¬£99 wrong on the price!"
2023,1,"Why can you not make this more like the web version. Let me select direct flights from the start. Let me see prices on individual dates. Let me select a range of dates. Let me select more than one airport to compare. Make the selection of dates less buggy, it keeps defaulting or just not work. This app would be better if it was just a link to the website. What's the point"
2019,1,Wake up and smell the Chromebook. Its not new technology anymore. Why can I not browse flights from my Chromebook? its fine until the point you have to put in your destinations... then nothing? After your reply it still sucks... why would you reply something like that anyway. I update my apps regularly. Why not just admit your app is not for Chrome OS. There are other apps for flights you know.
2023,1,not getting deal price shown and when click its higher
2019,3,"Always used Skyscanner for years and 90% of my travel. However taking a couple of stars off. The more added vendors, the more I'm facing a situation where prices quoted are later not available once you go to the 2nd stage of booking. Annoying and never used to happen before in this volume. Hopefully more control over practices that are evidently click baits from some companies. Otherwise a stable app and generally good rates in normal use."
2019,3,"Like the app but find it difficult that I have to search THEN filter. Would be so much better and less time consuming to filter first. So if I want to find flights to anywhere but only direct ones lasting under 4 hours, I'd like to be able to search using those advanced terms. At the moment I search but flights that last over 30 hours with 3 stops come up. Most of the flights advertised as in budget take 2 days to get to destination. Please could you introduce more search parameters?"
2023,3,"Love this app, but sometimes u get broken links, prices that don't exist, or the monthly planner shows one price than the total price is much More than the sum of it. The worse part is the explore everywhere button which is a brilliant idea, not always work. U press, and nothing. That's why they get 3 stars. They also do what flights websites do, once u searched several times, u won't get lower than that, just higher. But if u search on someone else's phone or online from another device, u will."
2023,5,Great platform for your travel needs.
2019,1,"I love Sky Scanner, it usually serves me well but lately, it is useless. Why tell me there is a direct flight from ¬£28 then when I click through there are no direct flights and the cheapest if over ¬£200? How is that helpful? Practically renders the app useless, I am going to have to find my flights somewhere else now till you fix this issue. Then I may come back. Also like someone else mentioned, bring back the 'cheapest', 'quickest', '2nd cheapest', etc, you used to have. Much better with that."
2020,1,"Bravo! Just learn from Skyscanner on how to turn one of the best flight ticket aggregators into a heaping pile of manure. The new update on the app has done away with the multi-city flight search option, which was THE best and most convenient feature. The lack of the multi-city search option renders this app useless. I really fail to understand the reason for this 'downgrade' just for the sake of rolling out new versions. The development team should just be fired for this phenomenal blunder."
2021,1,The new layout is really poor. Got to go through multiple screens for the simplest search. Where is the 'everywhere' option? Where is the multi-city search? Very unintuitive and can't really see anything that's improved. If it ain't broken....
2019,1,"It used to be awesome but now it sucks balls. Cluttered with a bunch of useless information I don't care about. I used skyscanner to check on cheap flights, nothing more. Now not only is it troublesome to do so quickly, even finding the app has become a chore because some moron decided they had to change the logo to something diametrically different. Final drop, I'm going to use another flight finder."
2020,1,Awful. The new app has completely trashed skyscanner. No longer the expert's choice of travel app its loss of functionality has downgraded it to just another cheap fares app. Many others do that better. Can't imagine what they were thinking of. Goodbye skyscanner genuinely sorry to see you smashed up like this.
2021,1,Unfortunately I've decided to uninstall and switch to another app. Been using this app since about 2014 and it's been completely ruined with the new update. Other apps have brought in the calendar search (specific days not these unspecified dots that actually make the whole function redundant. Change it back before you lose more customers. Someone who doesn't understand marketing has been hired to the wrong position. Upload the old version while you work on whatever it is next.
2023,2,"i did not want to give a bad review , but what have you done with the last updated is beyond understanding, please go back to the earlier layout. Why fix something which isn't broke."
2023,1,Why don't they make finding settings easy? Why hide the settings?
2019,1,"Rated 1 star because skyscanner listed BestJet, which had lost AFTA accreditation, with a 5 stars rating beside it. This had indirectly caused thousands of users, including me, who chosed to believe skyscanner, purchased their flight ticket through BestJet and thus lost up to tens of thousands of hard earned dollars. Skyscanner could have done better, that is, to remove every dodgy agents from their recommendations to better protect their users."
2023,1,"Terrible layout!! I need to use sky scanner to find some return flights. From the possible fights found, I would like to be able to pick the best outbound flight and then pick the best return flight. However, unless I've missed something (definitely possible) all i can see are hundreds of outbound and return PAIRS of flights that i now have to sift through. This is next to useless - actually worse than useless as it's a huge waste of my time."
2020,1,"Again a change of interface that makes it harder to simply search for flights... They tried this already a year ago, now the same again. Why make it so difficult to get to the interface everyone needs - flight search? I don't need a covid regulations map and some additional search window where I must first add a generic destination. I am not sure whether you really know your core users / customers..."
2019,1,"Since when Sunday is the first day of the week? Edit: regional settings in the app are set correctly (to my country, where week start on Monday). So my best guess is that it's a very irritating bug. Edit #2: you seriously can't fix a locale bug over two months..? The problem is that calendar checks locale from the set language of the app and NOT region you set your app. If you have trouble reproducing the bug, contact me and I will help you."
2022,1,"Used to be excellent. Usability now absolutely dreadful. It's almost impossible to search by month (hit and miss when it gives you the option to select a month) and whenever you want to change airport it takes you back to the home screen. I sincerely find it difficult to navigate, never used to be the case."
2022,1,"I booked my ticket for my December trip through this app in September. The app said that my booking is confirmed and my ticket will be issued shortly so I've waited for a ticket. However, it hasn't issued by a month before the trip so I contacted Skyscanner. Then, they said that they need the statement from the bank for refund. I didn't ask for a refund. I just needed my ticket. I'm so disappointed. I end up paying more than double for my new ticket. They should consider this problem seriously."
2022,1,"The app was working just fine until a week ago and I loved using it and purchasing tickets in it. However, after updating it, flights no longer load. It says ""Oops, something went wrong"". I can't use the app anymore. It could be my Android phone getting too old? I have no idea what the problem is but all my other apps still work great."
2023,1,It lists flights in a random currency and trust to get you to sign up to fix that problem. Yes sign up so it can overcharge
2020,1,"I won't be using the app anymore since the removal of the price graph. There is no way to search for the best prices anymore. As someone who used Skyscanner to book nearly every flight in the past, I'm taking my preferences elsewhere to a more upfront, more user friendly, and less greedy app that works for its users and not against."
2019,4,"great app but needs to be more transparent with its pricing as I noticed different price correlations between regions like for example it was more expensive to buy the exact same flight going the same way for the region of Thailand, then if I bought a flight in Europe which I found strange. but overall a good app to use if you want cheap flights."
2022,1,"Shows 3rd party booking agencies who issue boarding passes that are not accepted by the airline, so when you get to the airport you have to pay twice! There was no warning of this at any point of the searching or booking process. Also there are so many times that you find a good price shown then when you select it the prices skyrocket which makes finding an actual affordable flight very hard."
2019,1,"Things appear to have gone down hill since the recent change. Used to be a solid 4/5 stars but no longer easy to use/navigate. The option for a multi-city flights trip used to be very easy and obvious. Not even sure you can do that now?! If it is I can't see it. If not, it ceases to be useful. Shame."
2021,1,"It was always 5 start until the last update. Please bring back the usual 'from', 'to' and 'date' fields. This new set up makes it confusing to choose departure and destination. It's a really bad user experience. Sick to what works. From-Date To-Date."
2021,2,For some reason pushed me to edreams with no other options. Look at thier feedback! Rubbish. So now concerned of hassle for next 5 months waiting on departure time. On 5th email from edreams already. Why? Not only that cost 50% more than booking by jet2 direct. We are talking hundreds! Not impressed. Was going to delete Skyscanner app but will use but avoid thier suggestions for now. May eventually delete.
2023,3,"The app is useful, although the prices are not 100% accurate as the final price to be paid. And I am curious why Skyscanner would include those providers with only 1 star. And the part that I dislike is that although I am on price alert, I get no email,, until I personally go into the app again and check for latest prices.. the following day, I will get an email of prices that I was forced to check on my own because the price alert was not working."
2021,1,We were told we would have a flight credit at no extra charge for any flight because we had to stay in a different country in quarantine. But then they kept trying to guess more fees and more on the price difference apparently. I hate this company and I hate this app and I will never use them again no recommend them to anybody else.
2022,1,"Booked a complete ticket (2 checked bag and 1 cabin bag) based on the info displayed in the app. Turned out that it was a plus ticket (1 checked bag and 1 cabin bag). I paid the amount for the complete ticket and now I have to pay additional amount for an extra check-in baggage. Had I booked this same ticket directly from the airlines website, it would have been cheaper contrary to what the app was showing. Horrible experience !!"
2021,1,"I miss that part I could see the price bars, comparing between dates, it was the best part of the app. There I could plan which date could be the best option for me to travel, by analysing the price. The new interface brings three colours, but those colours don't tell me anything."
2019,1,"humans are worse the RATS and skyscanner is no exemption. they know I travel a lot and the algorithm is always trying to get high prices. I did exactly the same search lodged in, different browser and the one that goes incognito TOR gives the lowest price for exactly the same fight and dates and time. plus when click to next screen that shows all possible fights and prices, its price is increased above 9% from the calendar plus when go to book the ticked its even more expensive. RATS"
2023,5,I have used this app and to my surprise it is very reliable at guiding one on the best option for flights. Thank you very much.
2023,1,The app used to be amazing with the bar charts showing pricing. Could plan ahead. Fiddle about with dates/returns etc. Its now really complicated. Dont know why there is no direct filter on every screen. I dont want a result that shows 3 stop overs on a 2 hour flight to spain! Shouldnt even really be an option no matter how cheap it is.
2023,1,"Used to use this app all the time buy with it changing the price every time you click on a date, and the slow searches not going to be using it anymore."
2022,3,"Filter closes every second as flights keep updating Filters all reset on every search...very irritating when you're looking for the same filters to be applied........ [UPDATE]..... reinstalled app. Same issue. 1. Add locations and dates, search. 2. Filter departure times 3. Change dates, search ... All filter settings are removed and have to be entered again"
2023,3,There should be option to add checked bag in the search results. Edit: Thanks for your response. I installed the app again and waiting for the update.
2022,2,"Explore everywhere option is gone permanently from homepage, price shows less in beginning but when you go to book ticket, price suddenly increases dramatically to too high more than 3 times. This App have become like any other apps available in the market. This App seems useless now, for me atleast. Gave 2 star because earlier it was good, not anymore."
2021,1,"Couple of years ago this was the best app and experience you could get regarding flights. Now feels like the UI/UX has downgraded 90%. Reverting to the old if possible, would be the best option, it had all the features needed."
2022,1,Turned to be the worst app! I always used this app for my flight booking but now whenever I try to book a flight the rates shown in the list drastically differes and shows much higher rates. The fare gets increase by 2k to 4k per ticket. Will stop using and recommendations for Skyscanner. Very disappointed with the service n feels like I'm being cheated. Please stop fooling people
2018,1,"This app does not translate out well into a computer at all! You cannot see the flights you have saved on the app, when you open the sky scanner page on your laptop. This makes it quite pointless when you are trying to share multiple flights information with a group of people or share links on an email."
2021,1,The new app version is so bad I actually took the time to come to play store and give it a 1 star rating. I can't even begin to describe how frustrating it is that they replaced a very smooth UX/UI with an unnecessarily complicated and horrendous one. It's so bad I'd rather use the mobile web version anyday. Please rollback to previous version. The new version is severely damaging to your brand.
2022,2,"Used to be much better when they started. Now complicating things, too many ads and infos for each search. I wanted to build a trip but it's too much hassle: instead of asking when u want to go, from where, where you want to stay, for how long, you need almost to book the flights in order to go to next step"
2020,3,"In the flight results, half of the application is covered by ""about our search flight"" and it is impossibile to delete it. Moreover some features are not clear, the web version is not replaceable currently. I guess some UX is missing. I tried to reinstall the application, and the problem is not solved. I use a Oppo phone."
2018,1,"This is warning of Sky Scanner. I booked a flight last month on Premira airlines from New York to Hurghada, Egypt through Sky Scanner. When I went to the airport, I found out that the flight was cancelled because the airlines went bankrupt. The airlines didn't send me any notification before! I stuck in the airport for hours without any help. I didn't have enough money to buy another ticket. Without a help from a friend of mine, I could not have been returned to my destination! I tried to reach out Premira airlines but it was not possible, they shut down all their offices. When I emailed sky scanner, asking them to compensate me of the extra cost I paid, they simply said, this is not our problem, we are just search engine! I told them, that I understand that they are a search engine in normal cases but in such case when the airlines simply disappear without just notifying their customers, they have a responsibility if they want to keep reputation of being safe engine. It's serious matter that sky scanner didn't take notice that one of the airlines, it market for has cancelled all its flights three weeks before. I'm sure hundreds of people have gone through same agony and sky scanner didn't even bother to reach out with any notifications to at least inform them in advance so they could avoid the hassle and the cost of going to the airport!"
2023,1,They reduce the fare of flights because they put you on group bookings. Till last moment I haven't recieve boarding pass. Neither any confirmation from airlines
2020,1,"Congratulations on ruining what was a brilliant and useful app. The UI is so counter intuitive now it's basically unusable. The whole month function disappeared which means I need to use another site to find which days my flight runs. Absolutely awful, idiotic decision. I have already downloaded a different app and will be uninstalling Skyscanner as soon as I've posted this review."
2020,1,"Sky scanner is turning into sky scammer?? I have just found an itinerary, quoted and paid for that itinerary from the app with the only recommended partner Sky-Tours. 20 minutes later SkyTours is contacting me privately through email, changing the complete itinerary without any discussion or options This is on a multistop international trip. What a disaster. None of these transactions are visible in the app. Meanwhile my money is taken. [Updated with correct vendor name] [Full details sent to Skyscanner support showing 22% increase in pricing requested after paying the offered price, why take my money if you can't sell the ticket]"
2022,2,"When you're flexible with when you can fly, and are looking for the cheapest dates, the prices shown on the days rarely match what you find when you select that day and then search for flights for that day. For example, it says ¬£190 for a flight to New York, but then when you select that date, the cheapest flight that shows up is ¬£330. It makes the app pointless for me now as Google flight search now has the same functionality but with accurate prices"
2023,5,really easy and probably the most convenient search app. could have more cash back organised
2023,1,Experience was good until last night's update. After updating to latest update it looks like my device is listed as a robot device and I'm unable to perform any operation on the app. I tried uninstalling and installing again. Cleared cache couple of time. Not sure what's going on with the app and development.
2022,1,"I don't know what happened but this app has degraded badly. No matter what I try to search it shows me ""Oops something went wrong, there was an error loading hoot flight, please check your Internet connection while we check our servers"" This is on the android and has been effecting my expedience since a month, please fix it or I will be moving away from your app"
2023,1,"Still as poor as ever. Price difference from estimated to actual complete polar opposites. Doesn't like you selecting a whole month for travel flexibly wants actual dates. Why can't *direct flights only* be selected at the *initial search* instead of at the results page when they show 1/2/3/4 changeovers it's ludicrous why look into a 2 hour flight only to see its 16 hours long because of airport changes!? Benefit of the doubt I have in spades - this app, however... Never fails to disappoint."
2023,2,"Not as good as the website Edit: constantly shows no flights available, unable to just search flexible dates for full months like on the website. I look at entire 2-3 month periods on the website to see when the cheapest time to travel is, I can't do this on the app"
2023,1,"Thinking about your next adventure? Then don't use this app. Shows flights that don't exist, and the ones that do are through sites that don't clearly state that you aren't allowed luggage for example. No reputable providers in the price offerings. Don't waste your time. Used to be great."
2019,1,"The app was great once upon a time. It had a lot of useful functions, EG.: price widget, price comparison in a chart view. But the development team removed these features. In the current version it just knows what any other flight search knows. Nothing special. Sad thing. A lot of work to ruin a great app :-(."
2019,2,It's useful to use the price tracker to find the best time to buy... if it's accurate. When booking a recent trip I found the actual price of the flights almost double what the price alerts had been telling me. Not ideal for cost saving.
2020,2,"I am begging you guys to bring back the feature called ""calendar view"", which is a graph that shows the cheapest and most expensive flights depending on the day. This was single handedly the sole reason I used you guys for 100% of my flights and now the feature is gone. Now we just have to blindly guess which days are the cheapest and it takes hours. I promise I will change this to a five-star review if you guys can get this feature back. Please please please please. We are begging! Thanks!"
2020,1,"Due to the coronavirus pandemic, my flights home were cancelled. Attempted to call to arrange new flights, no answer. Called 3 times with wait times up to 90 minutes to try to arrange a refund which I was not able to get. My friend booked the same flight and was able to get a full refund but skyscanner was so slow that the airline's policy had changed and I was not able to get any refund. Flight status never updated on app, still says ""confirmed"". Will NEVER book through skyscanner again."
2019,5,"i loved this app, it was my 'go to app' when I needed to locate flights and used it frequently to source ones suitable for me. However in the last few weeks it's stopped working on my phone Blackberry android phone . Despite several re-installations it won't even open. I can only assume it's a software update. Am now left very very frustrated and struggling to source flights......Update. after using the link to update the Skyscanner Team about problem. They listened and resolved them !"
2019,2,For me the whole point of using flight aggregators is to search complex multi-city flight possibilites. There used to be clear cut the From airport and To airport. Now the From airport is hidden with a small font on top. In dialect we have a saying... Just be Smart dont Act Smart. Not evrybody is planning a trip from GPS phone location.
2022,5,I love Skyscanner! They make it easy to get on the app put in your destination and you can just click on the calender and see the prices for each day of the month. That way you can see the cheapest prices for wherever your wanting to go and grab your ticket right then and there. Plus some of the days on the calendar are unbelievably cheap and that is great!
2023,1,I will never buy through this app. I recommend not use this app because if there are any problems you cannot contact to anybody who can help you. Don't use this app
2020,5,"Great option for greener choices and more intelligent than just looking at the aircraft type. I find the app easy to use and is overall very good. A suggestion, as well as Best, Cheapest, Fastest. Could you add Greenest? Also consider actively prioritising the lowest carbon flights in searches could be useful."
2021,3,"Either the app is losing functionality (intentionally removing features) or recent versions are less intuitive to search/navigate (design flaw). Either way, I've switched to the mobile web version, which has an easier (&more familiar) interface."
2023,1,"Useless app. Browser version is faster, better, and user friendly. Why keep fixing things until they're broken?"
2022,1,"It's ALWAYS safer to book directly with an airline but if you're just researching prices, it's very annoying to be unable to search for business or first class fares on skyscanner by month only by a specific day. Why?! Economy fares can be searched for by the cheapest month, why not higher-end fares also?! Uninstalled in less than 2 minutes üëã"
2019,4,"Consistently the best out there. Yes, I still compare prices, via a couple of other top ranking apps. Prices may be +/- afew ¬£. But, I tend to come back to Skyscanner, due to their sponsorship of reliable ticketing agents. And, from experience, importantly, Skyscanner's very professional customer service. 1 unfortunate negative - too much space given up to roll up ads."
2023,2,"I grade down. I found an issue last a year with low cost flights prices. This is not a single event. The issue is all the cheapest flights , which are low-cost companies , are actually fake. After you fill out all details and even card number for booking , you receive a prompt like the airline company just rised up the price and you are required to pay more or cancel and leave. But this is fake, because by a new search you see again the same low prices."
2019,4,"The application offers lot of choices to choose from but, sometimes, the sites don't have the advertised price. Therefore, only 4*... However, you can have a good idea about the prices and the best month to fly. I use Skyscanner every time I need some tickets, for me or my friends."
2019,2,Poor searching criteria - you cannot search direct flights when selecting a country to country option - you have to go into each city presented with the first round of results and filter direct flights at that stage.. wastes time. You can do this on the desktop so will use that instead of the app.
2023,4,"Easy to use with lots of options offered. Although it is possible to filter out airlines, it would be useful to also exclude airports or geographic areas. Looking for flights to New Zealand from Europe, I keep being shown flights transitting through the United States. I have no wish to travel via North America, due to higher insurance costs and need to suffer US immigration controls."
2023,5,Very good app for cheapest flight search .
2020,1,"What the heck have you done. Was such a good app before it all got updated. Trying to get a direct flight and compare it over a month was what people use you for, now it's an absolute nightmare to use. Either change or you will lose your users very quickly because your developers have done the classic thing of wanting to keep going."
2021,1,"How is this new search interface better then the latest one? Its not newbie-friendly, it doesn't help you search for particular things you need and it takes you MORE steps to come to the same results. I now have to click all the way through all the steps not even paying attention, then come to an old search and only after that i start working on my search. But of course no one will struggle for no reason like that. So after mb 5 years of using skyscanner i change it for something else, sorry"
2021,4,Latest update has brought back the search UI like it was before the update that made it unusable. Thank you for that. I do miss a filter in the results for flights to avoid change of airports in the results. That would be very helpful. I believe thr web version has it.
2021,5,"The new interface is probably the worst, un-user friendly, interfaces I've seen for any service, ever, online or offline. How did anyone thought it's a good idea? Seriously guys, did you even test it with anyone other than the developers before releasing it? Edit: After the update the app is usable again, thanks! Changed to 5 stars"
2020,2,"Would prev have given this 5 stars but the option for the graph/slider bar seems to have disappeared with latest update. I instead have to go through clicking random calendar dates an searching endlessly for a good price. Way less user friendly and convenient, will be looking for an alternative app."
2023,4,Good site to look at airfares and flight times before purchase
2019,3,"I love this app and have been using it for the last 5 years. However, some sites are really hard to use or just completely useless like Modetour, Hanatour and Interpark. Why are they even an option if there is no English available on those sites? You also can't pay on those sites unless you are a member of some sorts somewhere, so again those sites are completely useless to give as options, it makes me happy to see good prices and times just to go onto their websites and be frustrated! Not happy"
2022,1,Highly recommend going directly through the airlines and skip skyscanner. Yes initially I saved money but that was before the fees kept piling up. Then came the fun when I realized I screwed up and needed to change the date. I emailed support thinking I'd probably get hit with a fee but worth it to go to my nieces baptism. Fee was an understatement the initial tickets for my daughter and I were just over a 1000 dollars the fee to change was 1670.00 no baptism. Also southwest had the same prices.
2023,1,I searched for domestic flights. It displayed the lowest value flight but when i have selected the lowest price flight from the list then it asked to select the provider. But non of the provider listed was displaying the same value that Skyscanner had displayed at first page. There was minimum difference of Rs.700. The app is not worth. Team has to work more on algorithm side.
2023,1,Prices on calander and booking prices don't match and all are higher than Kiwi app. Also too cluttered and harder overall to use than Kiwi. Uninstall. (Update: Skyscanner response is evasive mumbo-jumbo. People just want AVAILABE flights displayed at TOTAL current cost. Period. This app borders on scam. Kiwi is still much better ... and totally above board.)
2020,1,"Immediate uninstall. It's not letting me see multiple airports and compare flexible dates. I got 0 results and 700(!) were 'hidden' by filters, but these filters were very general whereas the filters I could have altered (see above) could not be changed. It quoted me ¬£3000 for a simple return to Germany... Complete joke."
2021,1,Still useless. Don't fix what ain't broke. You used to have a super easy user friendly app. It's impossible to even search for a destination. Too clunky. Just go back to your old version it was already perfect. This isn't a case of users being accustomed to the new UI. You now have a dreadful product and are ignoring every single identical review as to why you should fix/revert it. Given up for good now. I won't be using your app again. Fire your developer and business manager.
2022,1,"The app doesn't warn the users about the transit visa requirement for connecting fights in US. It also floods the search with these US connecting flights as they are cheap hence it can give wrong estimate about the market price. It also doesn't any filter for these US connecting flights which is really irritating. This app wasted my money, time and put me through a lot of hastle because of these issues."
2023,1,Now it doesn't search with a message that says there's been an error. I uninstalled and installed again but now I can't login to the account.
2021,2,"Please change it back to the way it was please üôèüôèüôè, 2 stars because this app was amazing and best of its kind, but not anymore, new version have 2 modes explore and search, the filters are limited to both sections and very confusing to use, previous version was simple and so easy to use, you guys can do poll on this and ask all users and see what everyone says about new version and maybe that will help to create better UI. after all this app is for our use only :) so why not ask us ?"
2023,2,"Buggy. On selecting which site/company to buy the flights from, a new screen appears asking for feedback on the site, even though you haven't even gotten that far yet. Can't skip. Even if you give feedback just to get past that stage, you just go back to the ""Select"" page. So, can't complete process using this mobile app."
2019,3,"The last update is so disappointing. Logo looks like weather app. Start up flight searching separated pages (dates, where to, from where) are inconvenient. Please, revert to previous searching modes as before using convenient search from 1 page all-in-one: date, to, from, quantity of passengers etc."
2020,1,"Used to good. Simple to use. Not any more. Can't use contact us button on website. Doesn't work. The ""improvements"" have made this app clunky and awkward to use. All I want to do is search then delete history. Disappointed. Seems I'm not alone regarding these updates. Why change something that worked really well. Will be looking elsewhere now. Its actually easier to search with Google."
2023,1,"Will immediately start sending you spam emails. Even if you opt out of marketing news. Just, annoying."
2023,5,"Thanks to the incredibly user-friendly and comprehensive Skyscanner app, my recent travels have been a breeze, with the app's efficient search algorithm and price comparison features allowing me to easily find the best flight deals and travel options available, ultimately saving me both time and money and providing a stress-free experience that I highly recommend to any fellow adventurers."
2021,1,This used to be the best app I swore by it but they removed the explore option and filled it with just articles it's lacking what made it so special now I can't plan spontaneous trips with spontaneous dates I have to have all that info. The other options made it fun to plan a trip when it's cheaper.
2023,1,"Raises my prices of A LOT on this phone, after having booked many flight. Another phone with VPN I find MUCH lower prices."
2022,1,"Only app I've ever used that was worse than the mobile web page. Provides no additional search options and I couldn't even find the one for ""direct flights only"". When I went back to chrome mobile, I couldn't even use the site to view flights because chrome insisted I use the app instead. How useful."
2023,4,Skyscanner app helped me in finding my next flight. It is a nice app and will get you better deals then other booking websites. Note to the developer - the issue I was facing earlier where I was not able to book the flight tickets has been resolved. I am redirected to the website from where I want to book the flight. Thank you for fixing the issue.
2023,4,Where's the explore where functionality? It doesn't load the locations anymore for the next 3 weeks and 3 months etc
2020,1,"I used to love this app. However, they removed the android widget. This was the best part of the app. Very frustrating. Widget used to show dates and prices of 10 cheapest flights for a given route. Useful for people with open schedules. Now you can only get ONE (The cheapest across all dates). So stupid! They need to fire the bozo who did this change! I won't increase my ras ting until they restore the widget."
2023,1,There is no special fares same as available on other sites no competition in staring there is a fare war you get cheaper tickets but know they are at same price now the sky scanner is useless
2022,1,"Useless, freezes constantly. I'm using the car rental option. On some options when I click to go through to the provider it freezes once open. I have to close the app. This is particularly true of Discover Cars. Also, clicking on a vehicle option never takes me to that vehicle, which is utterly pointless. Oneplus 7t, latest android build."
2022,1,"This is to inform that there was an increased of amount at the last phase of processing my booking from 365 to 391 AUD real quick in booking my flight. They gave the option to proceed or not but for a customer in desperation to get the spot, I had to take it but it was too much of a jump that was uncalled for so I had to rate the site 1 star. Hope this won't happen to others if the site would be genuine enough with their original tactics of gaining loyal customers in future."
2019,2,"So so so non intuitive UI, older versions were much better, easier to understand and faster too. Not liking it, user experience sacrificed for looks. Edit: Thank you for coming back to me, good to know you don't take these things personally, keep making us happy :)"
2023,5,Brilliant app. Very accurate will rates and quick to notify you of deals.
2021,1,"It used to work fine. The latest update (end of 2020) has led to a useless app. Now you can't choose the cheapest month or day, the UX is super confusing. You don't have the typical ""from / to"" date calendar, etc. It's horrible. Uninstalling right now..."
2022,1,"no use of filter in the initial search screen is a big miss. you get to results page and are presented with great flight options, only to learn you have an 18 hour stop over. greater the filters exist in the results but it's a no brainer to predetermine your search, like with Google flights"
2022,2,The app isn't great. Can't search nearby airports and also is glitchy with dates. I don't know if the search includes everything I'm looking for and have to use others Momondo etc. Very disappointing. The Skyscanner website version is excellent and would be good if the app had more features like this.
2023,1,They price on this app is nothing like on Web. I check fly from Luton to Poland was ¬£492 wen I was redirected to Wizzair I end up with ¬£789.
2021,2,They removed the best functionality of the old version of the app which was the calendar and it told you when prices are going to be higher or lower in the near future (predictive analytics) and the alerts worked on that. Now I have alerts that don't do anything and I'm not liking the interface or features. Google flights is better. Why use Skyscanner now with all the best features removed???
2023,5,"Amazing app - Beautiful user interface, smooth UX and great prices. Absolutely recommend, this is the best flights/hotels booking app one can find. Their customer support is also world class. Love it."
2019,3,"App works pretty well. One day an alert popped up on my phone that said Skyscanner has just attempted to use the camera, or something to that effect. As a flight search app has zero need of the cameras, it felt like a direct violation of my privacy so I immediately removed it."
2019,2,"Decent app but I never get the price suggested by the options given. Filter options on app should be a they are on the website. Like no airport change, no airline combination etc. One more filter should be type of aircraft 777, 787, 380 etc this would enhance my flight booking experience But still price suggested should be exact rarely it matches. We end up paying more."
2023,4,"It works, but not effortlessly. When I check on a flight I saved, I have to change the number of people even though the flight saved is for that specific amount of people. Also it would be nice if I didn't have to manually check saved flights because they update on their own instead of staying the same price it was when I saved it forever."
2019,1,"Bought ticket & credit card charged. Able to see under upcoming trips but when i click, it says ""sorry, something went wrong"". Uninstall and reinstalled. Clicked again, able to view. Then refreshed, and back to being ""sorry, something went wrong"" Not sure if my ticket has really been confirmed or not... @_@"
2020,3,It's a good app but the problem is that the search results on web page and app are not similar. The results we get on web page doesn't shows on app for the same filters and parameters. Please do something about that. Sync the data properly.
2022,1,"This application is worthless, ad i booked the flight, my amount has been deducted but i dont see any booking in the app, didnt received the text or email for the same. They are cheater, they just took money of innocent people without booking their flights. I will suggest not to book flight from this app. This is not trusted app. Also i tried reaching out to customer care no. but still no progess, their nom is temporary out of service. I think strict actions needs to be taken."
2022,1,"App used to be soooo gooood. But now, some important features have been removed. The graph feature on the Explore search is gone, so you really can't see price comparison anymore. The prices aren't up-to-date. Also, you can't set your local airport as favourite."
2021,1,"I've never reviewed an app before, but I feel like it warrants it this time. The latest upgrade has made the interface so much less user friendly. What happened to quickly swapping the locations over? And switching between one way / return. Please don't fix what's not broken"
2020,1,"I really hope you add back the ability to search without a specific date, because now it's completely unusable. Before I could just book a flight within minutes and now it could take me hours. The user experience is not even there right now. Once you add it back I will change my rating."
2021,1,"The app just gets worse and worse. No filter for direct flights, the prices shown are not even real, no explore option, useless attempt to make it a travel blog, hard to navigate. What a pity, I used to love the app! Fire the UX developer! NB. If it needs explaination is not user friendly."
2020,1,"After the app has been updated it became impossible to use. Not sure who designed the new version, but nothing works as one would expect. Recommendation: Roll back to the previous version and run proper user testing of the new design. As it is currebtly, it's absolutely counter intuitive."
2021,1,This new skyscanner interface is terrible. The older was was streamlined and so easy to navigate. I loved it. Whoever designed and or approved the new interface messed up. Bring back the easy to use format I loved so much.
2019,3,The app worked fabulously and i used it to travel to vatious locations across globe. Recently i am froced to use other apps as skyscanner is not giving complete result and misses many airlines. Whereas if skycanner is opened on web it gives complete results. Please look into it. I will rate the app again if the glitches are removed.
2023,5,Brilliant app! Made it so easy to compare prices and found cheaper flights through this particular app.. recommended by me!
2018,1,"I booked with them only to get an email saying it wasn't available and they tried to upsell me more expensive tickets. It is stressful enough booking flights, this app just makes it worse by making you think you had your flight booked. Skyscammer is more like it."
2022,4,"When setting up my profile, I was forced to add at least one person that I travel with. I don't have a specific person that I travel with. When I do travel with friends, I don't make travel arrangements for them. So I listed the 1st name as No and the last name as One and picked a random birth date. I felt like this was another example of the world not recognizing how many single people there are. In my opinion, this is a silly and insulting requirement."
2020,1,"I am not sure why you dissappear options like select a month, or the graphics to compare the prices every day, even to look now is weird because i can't select the airport from I am departing or a date before to look for the destination, and then change those things after that, just this last version is totally ruined."
2019,3,"You can't sear h all the flights. It just tells you the cheapest deals. Way better on browser because you can actually be specific or vague about your flight dates, whereas the app seems to just choose a date for you? It doesn't just show the cost of the flights on the calendar. So difficult to use"
2023,4,great deals excellent customer service
2023,3,upfront rates are not realistic w.r.t provider fee
2023,1,i wasted a lot time on ur seach going to japan .. link to cheapticket.co.th it gave fake price and the real price is far more expensive... stop doing this to ur customers
2023,1,"Error always. Almost everytime I use this app to search for the best price flight, the error wording 'Oops, somethings went wrong...There was an error loading your flight...' always appears. I tried re-installing and re-login for many times, but it doesn't fix the problem."
2021,1,SO BAD NOW! The update has less features and is much harder to control. You can't even put in direct flight or not. Every time they upgrade this site it is half as good. Who are your programmers answering to? Fire them and quickly get back to 2 version version ago before you lose anymore customers. I am going to any other site than this one. Good luck.
2023,5,Great app for booking and searching for the best flights. used many times over the years
2023,5,so far its been giving out quite competitive results in terms of pricing and selections. enjoying it.
2023,1,You have to run the flight and get all results before filtering which is to say the least illogical. Is this so you can get money for preferring airlines that are useless to the enquirer? The quickest filter seems not to work where there are stopovers or if more than one day. One flight listed as quickest at 16hrs in fact was a 2 hr flight followed by 14hr stopover followed by 16hr flight making it the longest of any of those listed. What was once king of the market can no longer be relied
2023,2,poor search outcomes.... specifixc suggestions: the option are not optimized especially if searching for a multiple city trips....it did not show as much opetions as momondo for example
2023,3,"Excuse me , your app Why : No have Flight Istanbul To Moscow ? But other app have this flight , I want use your app not other app"
2023,5,skyscanner is the best app
2023,5,"This app is very goood and provide the latest and cheapest flight tickets, I really love this app, they even reply to our issues if they are bugs, I appreciate everyone who is working for the skyscanner app."
2019,1,"Be aware, app tracks your searches and removes cheapest flight tickets, I found out about it recently looking for a flight to asia, use kayak or go incognito through Google website Edit: after dev. Reply, I can provide you with missing flights yet available in incognito mode from your website, didn't mean that someone removes flight but somehow they are missing as it happens to be the cheapest once as well, any ideas how it's possible?"
2023,1,"Find the most expensive flights only, and also most not direct flights. Better off using known holiday booking sites."
2019,1,"I don't see the benefit of having this app. I just looked for a fare RdTp EWR to SXM(Saint Maarten) on this app, $370 non-stop there but with a 16hr return on another airline. When I tried to change the first leg to a Rd tp with the first airline it jumped to $631. Wow, that's a shaving not a saving. Went straight to United RdTp non-stop $360. Why would I want to use this app again? Am I missing something here?"
2021,1,"Simple Skyscanner will steal your money, they never care about customers after you pay. I booked 2 way ticket, they sent email that airlines changed the return time, I accepted, they didn't send me the return ticket at all! In more than 30 days, they never followed up, I followed up with them many times, response was (airlines didn't issue the ticket yet) Bought new ticket as I couldn't travel, they sent my partial refund after 30 emails of refusing, i paid 155 extra euro for their mistake."
2023,1,Skyscanner works with probably world's the most greedy brokers. They charge nearly half of the ticket price for a flight cancellation done by the airline company. It's something not up to me and I lost my ticket and half the money I paid. I will not use this app again and buy all my tickets from direct airline companies. At least they offer another ticket on another flight when cancellation happens.
2021,2,"I don't know how this app is with regard to flights as i didn't even bother after seeing how much of a fail it was towards hotels. Comparing this app to Kayak is a huge difference in pricing same hotels same dates the pricing was almost twice as expensive as Kayak. Deleted the app and am sticking to Kayak instead. Kayak prices you their prices and even their competitor prices, i tipically will chose a kayak purchase in leu of my appreciation for their honestly. This app just ain't it."
2021,2,"Skyscanner please look on review sites before signing with travel agents like mytrip . They are using your site for scamming even when you get insurance . They need a full investigation as they book your flights through your app , say the flights cancelled (I honestly think they don't actually book it ) and then refuse to refund . Since you have no contact unfortunately I have to do it here"
2023,1,Better apps out there. I cannot even find a way to select the same airport to return to. I don't want to return to a different airport if my car is going to be parked at another! Prices also change from the one that you see. I also cannot save a price alert with my chosen filters. Pointless.
2022,2,"Please make it possible to filter on 'direct flights only' BEFORE the results page, for example when searching for flights to any destination. I don't want the app to tempt me with places like Seville or Brindisi or Stockholm only to find I can't get a direct flight there. You can literally get from any airport to any other airport if you're prepared to take multiple flights!"
2019,4,"Changing your options to search for different flights is difficult. You cant just click on the section you want to change , you have to back compmetely out of the search amd start a new one basically. But there are alot of cheap flights available."
2021,1,Surface of use become too complicated. It use to be very simple use and to the point. Please dont try to outsmart or be like facebook that makes annoying and useless changes. Stay simple and true to who you are - life is simple no need to complicate things.
2021,1,"Hi, Installed latest update of app. I want to see prices on each day on calendar. It used to show on old versions of this app. Bring it back otherwise app will be useless. Thanks. Hi, Your reply is beating the bush around. Don't tell me how to search for a date or access calender. You exactly know what I am asking. Calender does not tells anymore which day has cheap flights!"
2019,1,"This app would actually have made me pay more because I was on Delta site and found a good flight before taking a look at this app. I looked and noticed that first they didn't have lower prices then the ones I found. Also, they lied because on one of the cheaper supposed days to fly as they said it was more expensive then the day I flew which according to them had moderate prices."
2019,1,"Last update destroyed it. Previously it was easy - you out itinerary, you out your dates and here you go. Now it it asking for dates first, then it wouldn't allow me to chose ""London all airports"" Guys - if it is not broken it doesn't need fixing. Good app it was... Have to uninstall it now and use just their website The idiot who did the last update needs to be fired"
2023,1,"Awful recent updates. No idea what has gone on, you can no longer see the calendar of flight options, it's too busy giving you odd data recommendations. Don't usually write reviews, but the current version of the app is unusable"
2018,4,I think is the best flight search engine. The only reason that i give 4 stars is that its very hard to find cheap dates now. I was using the 4.9 version of the app untill 3 days ago but now it has stopped working. That is the version that i recommend as best and easiest ever to find cheap date flights.
2022,1,I booked my flight and they took sent me an email after couple of hours with explanation that my request failed and I will get money back in 5-10 days. I tried to book another flight through the app and that flight wasn't on official site of the airline company! It was the first time that I used this app and never again. Very bad experience!
2022,3,"Hey Skyscanner - put a feedback button inside your app so I can send you suggestions privately - where has the ""direct flights only"" button gone when I am picking my date? This is a massive oversight, prices on dates are useless if you can't show those dates with direct flight only prices. Its available on desktop still. - There are some changes which have meant to streamline the app but have made it worse by removing the amout of customization for a search."
2020,2,"I have been using this application for years now but today I was disappointed because your algorithm thinks is smarter than your customers, so I was searching for a specific flight and when I got to your provided calendar it was showing so many green marked dates or cheap flight,when I decided to change my destination and later went back to the same destination all of a sudden your algorithm decides that no more green marks on the calendar for the same search from few minutes ago so that's üò°"
2023,2,"During, booking my tickets it is showing booking for only 1 passanger, I am not able to select more than 1 passanger. As I have added 3 passangers but the app is asking that, you can select only 1 person at a time. If family has 3 members than how can we book individual for everyone, it should be in one. #skyscanner Kindly go through it. Awaiting for the answer."
2021,1,"Every Travel app as soonest you install and open it you get today's date or the day you're using.... I looked for a plane ticket for today never change month, day, and much less will I change year. Well I bought a ticket for today and paid. When I get the confirmation was today's date except for the year!!! I call to the airline and no they didn't have nothing to do with it, so I am looking to contact Skyscanner and there's no way to find a customer service phone number.. now??"
2022,1,"Awful. You select your dates and select everywhere to see the available options to decide where your going, only to find you have to go into the destination city before you can select direct flight only then there are no flights. If only you could select direct flights from the search instead of sifting through every city and selecting direct only!!"
2020,1,"It constantly shows the following: ""There is an error loading your flights. Please check your internet connection while we check our servers."" I mean I'm rating the app with my internet and that seems to be working fine. So far the application has been disappointing."
2022,1,"They have the HIGHEST prices of all the search sites and have to most invasive sign up to get the deals including I.D. numbers and exp dates ect..so in order to get the deals you will need to give them enough information to completely still your identity or you won't get the ""real deals"" NO way to contact them. On the surface they only show you the most expensive prices and even make getting alerts a total long process and Hassel. This app is dangerous and frustration!! I'm reporting them."
2023,1,Got a booking done through skyscanner. It redirected me to other websites. I have completed the booking with Flight Network and it created automated email address for all airlines. Now i cannot manage my bookings and flight network and airlines does not want to help. Skyscanner allowed flight network to hamdle these bookings and it is equally responsible
2021,1,"The recent updates are a disgrace, ruined all of this. I agree with all the other recent reviews that are angry that you've removed the new features. I can only think that Skyscanner is deliberately making it harder to find cheap dates to fly so that customers end up paying more and they somehow get higher commission from the airlines. Why else would they remove their best feature? Skyscanner you are pathetic, bring back the old features or you will lose so many loyal customers."
2019,5,"Dear Member or members of this app develop team, I am a very fan of your this app. I am using this app for a long time on both iOS (iPhone) and Android and PC... It helped me a lot... but after last update in android, I think I lost your ""Chart"" option for the price of Air Ticket and also another very useful option ""Multi-city""... :-( PLEASE.... PLEASE...... add thoes options again.... we are in need of those options a lot... Thanks a lot for clear me up... :-). (on your reply)"
2021,4,"App works well, customizable notifications and you can set multiple ""trips"" if you want to play with dates. Deleted it because we want to fly Southwest and they don't include them. Other airlines have hidden fee for checking bags."
2018,1,PLEASE DO NOT BOOK TICKETS VIA THIS APP. Booked tickets via Sky scanner . Money got deducted for airlines called budget air but didn't receive the tickets. When contacted sky scanner they mentioned that they can't do anything and contact budget air. They didn't provide any customer support with their email Id or number. Budget air asked for proof stating the payment was deducted. Sent the bank statement . Post that they stopped responding. MONEY LOST AND NO TICKETS
2022,1,I was searching to skyscanner for the best deals for a trip to see friends in usa and wanted to get the revalant and best information and flights because of the covid 19 pandemic .....I hav since now been blocked from accessing the site as I think that the scanner bots think i was misusing the site Its been very frustrating and I was about to purchase a ticket after workn out the best deal for me and I was booted I do not hav access the server now I'm very disappointed
2020,1,What on earth were you thinking? Where is the multi-city function. I want to fly from London to Quito then from Lima back to Manchester. The app and website look cleaner but have lost their functionality. Back to Expedia unfortunately.
2021,1,"This app is not effective at providing accurate cheapest flight details. If you search flights via different hubs, individual searches on different legs of a journey provides price differences of around 40% less for the same journey from start to final destination compared to the pricing provided for flight searches from the journey start position to the end destination as a single search. Also, when searching Agoda website, flight prices are cheaper than on Skyscanner."
2018,5,"Easy to use, no ads, and you really do find some of the cheapest flights around. Love the ""Fly Everywhere"" search option. My only complaint is the amount of difficulty it takes to search by whole entire months instead of a specific date."
2019,4,"so far so good for one way and round trips but when you put in Multi City the results are so confusing I can't make it out. I am looking for a long haul Int'l flight with multi cities and I am totally lost. Other than this, its a good app."
2019,1,"I used this app for many years, time to uninstall and find an alternative flight finding app.You have ruined it. Used to be great but now the new app is terrible. You used to be able to find the cheapest day to fly but not any more, now it's the same as every other app. Such a shame. Why didn't you leave it alone. You have lost this customer of many years."
2019,4,"Very handy and quick. In sort and filter, it would be useful to add further options such as sort by cheapest, fastest, most popular, etc. And also to show results based on specific departure / arrival time interval instead of one sided interval."
2022,2,"It's a decent search tool but there's no option to save a search to the ""Trips"" page. And it will not remember any searches performed directly from the ""My Trips"" page. Even when I turn on notifications for a search. This app is embarrassingly broken"
2019,5,"Amazing app! I'm so pleased with the deals this was able to find for me. I had four similar apps to search for flights and rentals, and none of them even got close to finding the deals that Skyscanner found. Very grateful that I found Skyscanner. I will be using for years to come!"
2022,3,"There is a serious problem. When you find a better rate and go to that particular site for booking, rates change or there are service fees that make it a bad choice. Search results should show final prices including all hidden costs and charges. If this issue isn't fixed, it's really useless."
2021,5,Thank you for reaching out. I'm not sure what the issue was. I even restarted my phone several times. But it seems to he working again. Back up to the well deserved 5 star rating. I found out about your app from some traveling youtube content creators. Very impressive and competitive pricing search. Difficult to find any lower prices.
2021,1,"Very bad new interface, very clumsy, almost useless. It used to be the best flight search app. I already changed for another app. If you change it back to the previous interface, let me know, I might swap back."
2023,1,"Ok it's been a while since I've used this app but it used to be good. Now it looks terrible, it's unclear, what happened to departure and destination? Now there's departure and some weird symbol like I'm going to mark a spot on a map. Doesn't display nearly as many flights, no flights from Jetstar? Do they have to pay to be included? Shows 1 flight from the monthly view, yet if you pick a blank day, what's up with that? There is nothing nice to say about this app. Bring back the old one."
2019,5,"I love this app. It's fast and responsive, filled with deals you wouldn't find elsewhere like Expedia or Travelocity. i found a last minute flight that was almost $200 cheaper than any other website. Definitely one of my go-to apps!"
2020,5,Update: They have now updated the app and it now shows prices in order like before. If you're looking for an app that provides spontaneous travel this app is for you. Earlier this year I went to America for 3 months after finding super cheap flights to Boston. Can't recommend enough.
2019,2,"The app itself is good, clean, easy to use and offers the same as the web browser version...the reason that I've marked it down is my phone kept detecting it using the camera in the background, despite me switching off the permission to do so."
2020,2,"Seriously a once great travel booking app that has been degraded to a confusing non linear mess with limited results, this app does not work like it used to and regrettably I have to find a better 'workable' solution. Needless to say uninstalled and won't be back to this once exceptional now trash application."
2020,2,The new layout is terrible for what I use the app for...to find good flight deals. Instead it has moved away from its original purpose and instead dumps me in a page full of reviews and ads. The app itself keeps restarting while navigating around this mess. Disappointed.
2023,1,"So many ads on tv for this app but 2 months of using this app... it hasn't given me a single price change update for the tracked destinations. Everyday it gives me alert that price hasn't changed. On other end, I confirmed that prices has changed on the tickets for the destinations I was tracking."
2021,1,"A scam like the others. It only tells you up or down prices from the last price, not from the original watch price. You can easily think you are getting a deal when in actuality the price may be several hundred dollars higher than your original watch price. The whole reason to watch a price is in hopes it goes down from what you first saw.....that is when I set the watch, duh!"
2019,3,It's quite an intruding little app for a ‚ÄòNotepad' It gives itself permition to access you accounts and contacts. Don't think of it as a simple text editor. It's not !! I definitely wouldn't use it to store any sensitive information on my phone.
2022,1,"Prior to the recent update, I was able to view the equipment, i.e. the plane type in use for the selected journey. This isn't available anymore. So one more option os choosing a comfortable cabin has been taken away. Probably it isn't worth using this app anymore. Direct booking with airlines would be better.üëé"
2020,1,"Used to love this app. This last update is absolutely awful. They took away the ability to search as destination ""anywhere"" and dumbed down the interface way more than necessary considering it was already simple enough before. Please revert back to the old interface!"
2021,1,"New updated app is awful. Really poor and limitted build. Awkward to use and navigate between destinations. No switch departure/destination fuction. Just a pain to use. Not user friendly. Wont use anymore, better, quicker, more user friendly options available."
2023,3,Not really the fault of Skyscanner but some of the airlines advertise the lowest fare which only allows for a handbag. Once you add in a carry on bag or luggage in the hold that cheap ticket jumps up. Trying to compare prices then is really difficult. The actual fares can only be determined by going to each individual provider.
2019,4,"It really does look at airliners, that dont show up, on bigger search engines. plus I have seen them, to be cheaper that expedia. One thing I wish they would do. Is to not show sold out tickets on searches. It just confuses people. Other than that good app."
2020,1,"WORSE. EVERY. skyscanner cannot help me to get in touch with the travel agency which is ""TRAVELGENIO"". Changes were made to my flight through the airlines and i cannot do anything for refund or rescheduling unless Travelgenio does that from their end. And travelgenio does not pickup the calls or reply to the email and my flight is in 3 days. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO IN THIS SITUATION. Skyscanner should work with agencies who are legimate but IT'S ALL FAKE & SCAM! VERY DISAPPOINTED. 0%"
2020,1,"First time I had booked my flights for 3 adults, but unfortunately there was a issue with the covid-19 the whole world. So was trying to get in touch with travel up on which I had booked my flights for more than a week. Not a single customer care representative is replying emails nor answering calls. This is the worst customer service I ever experienced in my life. Don't no whom to deal with my query."
2023,5,Had to book multiple flights within a span of 10 days. If I would stick with one particular OTA I would have spent way more than what I did using Skyscanner. Loved the fact that I could use different service providers for different dates. Very useful app.
2021,2,This app use to be amazing and straight forward but after a UI update/change it is impossible to actually search for a flight from one location to a destination. Not sure why you changed the user interface when it was perfectly functional.. quite disappointed
2023,1,"Latest update has made it really annoying to use, it was previously so simple to quickly look for specific dates and adjust. Now the explore feature just gets in the way, isn't helpful and means I have to start again to do minor adjustments to my search. So annoying!"
2020,1,"Privacy problems. No matter what I do, turn off all location settings and this app can override and figure out the country I'm in. While this is a privacy concern, the third party search results remain in the wrong currency and language despite setting them in the Skyscanner app's preferences. Uninstalled."
2019,5,"This is the best travel app. Period! They are honest, reliable and and with a usee friendly interface. Thank you, Guys. You guys are doing a great job. I think other travel app should learn from 'Skyscanner' how to make it easy and useful to the consumers."
2019,2,"Found less expensive flights on Expedia. Also, when I tried to book a flight on my phone, it kept saying that I had to ""choose how to proceed"" which didn't give me any indication on how to proceed. All of the programs that came up as options didn't actually allow me to book a flight. Seems like their app wasn't compatible with my phone."
2019,3,"I cannot set the parameters for my plan, I can only set the number of travellers for a flight (which completely changed prices for me) and for accomodation separately. So I cannot ""get inspired"" for two adults at all. Probably I won't use this service for accomodation that way."
2019,4,It's doing the job! Found where I'm going with ease and set notifications. My only gripe is i had to set notifications for each different day as my departure date is flexible and I'm just looking for the cheapest flight.
2019,5,"Absolutely fantastic app and the only place you can search up hotels and flights and it gives you great options, it has the best prices for you even while you're in the app its consistently trying to give you the most up-to-date pricing! Totally recommend this app. You won't be disappointed.üòÅ"
2019,5,"its OK, but not as functional as an app as the web site is. Can't do an 'open' search or search by month etc. The app would be better if it had the full functionality. UPDATE. after speedy info from customer support have tried as suggested and it works. It was just my inability to use the app properly. Have upgraded from 3 to 5 stars."
2019,5,"Getting really good results from this app. Nicely designed and results load very fast. Shows best, cheapest, and fastest flights - 3 categories - at the top of results so you won't waste time scrolling a lot to find the right flight. I booked my Greece trip flight through Skyscanner and it worked out quite well. Much better than scanning a lot of individual booking websites."
2023,5,"It is a pretty good app. You would get great deals on it most of the time. I have booked flights to Munich twice on Skyscanner and was able to get the best deals. In fact the people who I booked it for was quite surprised by the deal I was able to find, when it was a lot expensive when they checked else where."
2020,1,"HATE the newest version. Too many clicks to just choose your origin, destination and date. All used to be on one screen and now it takes you through multiple steps. They've sacrificed usability for aesthetics. Shame."
2022,2,The app is ok but the user experience Kris getting worse not better. It's really frustrating that you can select direct flights only when you first set up a search and it changes the airports or dates you are looking for when you just try to go back
2020,1,"This used to be the best app out there! Now its confusing, garbage. Where once you are able to get tons of different flights at prices with different times of those flights but now it only offers you one flight.... the cheapest flight. Sometimes flying time is more important than price! Bring back the old sky scanner!"
2022,1,"My tablet is not a phone and app rotates vertical, very anoying and counterproductive. Furthermore you used to be able to program in a widget that would at a glance show you price change of your desired trip and now you must dig for the information. Old saying goes, if its not broken don't fix it. This app was great but now the app sucks."
2020,1,"App keeps crashing on my OP6T. Every time I redirect to an affiliate to make a booking, I'm hindered by page freezes. I manage to complete a few pre-booking steps like fill up some forms and even got to the payment page once, but it just freezes on me inevitably. P.S. - I've cleared my cache."
2019,5,"it's the best search engine for flights and cars! Not that good for hotels, but for the rest is the number 1 I totally recommend it if you're planning a trip, you can get the best prices and it have very cool search options like going everywhere or to a specific country"
2019,1,"Not sure your app is longer useful after the level of add-on the carriers have evolved making your fee comparisons no longer fit for purposes (you can compare an Iberia trip with a Ryanair because whilst in one you can bring your cabin trolley, in the second you can only place your two hands in pockets)...despite your disclaimers. Shame!"
2021,4,"very comprehensive and helpful in finding various routes and apparently cheap options, yet it should include an explicit warning regarding self transfer with low cost carriers, those companies which frequently change hours and days (Ryanair for instance). Self transfer, especially with 2 stops, is a high risk on the verge of gamble when it depends on them."
2022,5,I've been using this app for 8 years now. That was when I took my very first plane trip ever. I have become an avid traveler since then and I ALWAYS use Skyscanner to get my tickets because they always have the best prices by far. Even google and CheapOair are more expensive. It's been awesome to see this app grow and to also grow with it.
2022,1,"Terrible after sales support I had an airline cancel the flights due to Covid. Was supposed to get 100% refunded. I have accepted considerable charges from Sky Scanner evern though the cancellation had nothing to do with me. After 4 weeks I am still waiting to sort it out. They keep trying to add more fees that are unjustified and keep making excuses about the case being handled by managers. I buy atleast 50 tickets per year, these guys are quick to take your money. Good luck getting it back"
2019,3,"Good app which I have used for a number of years. Don't like the new search interface. The older versions were much quicker to use. I want to select to, from and dates all on the same page without having to click to the next window."
2019,2,"What happened to the flight ratings??? I travel international very often and I used to love using this app, it was rating each flight based on price, length, layover, etc. which was amazing. Now I don't know whether that went! This is extremely dissatisfying and disappointing. Fix this ASAP or I'm deleting this app."
2022,2,"The app is not as good as the website, as it won't let you filter through destinations under the ""Explore"" feature until you actually choose a destination. I wish I could filter for non stop flights before choosing my destination!"
2022,2,"This is horrible, my dates are flexible and am looking for the most convenient and cheaper flights. This is not available and the pricing shown on the calender doesn't correctly reflect when you tap on it. Such a disappointment"
2020,5,"Would like to see a widget for home screen that can refresh and show ""watched fares"" for faster and more accessible flight watching. This app is great though. Just could be better with a widget instead if f waking up to a notification about price changes every day."
2023,1,"At first I was impressed but after 3 attempts at buying my ticket, each time without fail, rates hiked by nearly 100-125%. Really unfortunate as the app has a decent layout and easy to use Interface but the price hikes are enough to deter me from using the app to book flights."
2023,1,"The user experience on the app is soo bad. You can not set the filters before you search. I have to search first, guess Which days there are flights and then after the results appear, only then can I filter for direct only which removes all of the results so I have to start again. Do they not test these things?"
2019,2,"Latest update doesn't allow to add all passengers before searching for flights. Only can add passengers if I click on particular flight. This issue needs changing, it's annoying. Other than that love the app and using it regularly."
2020,1,"Great concept, fails to execute. Saw Greece flights were from $676, spent days dreaming up our vacation, returned to see it still showed from $676, even showing the dates for that price. But alas when you click further, the cheapest flights are $936. That's too big of a difference to continue using the app."
2021,3,"App used to be very good. Have recently started using the app again to find a lot of the functionality has disappeared. Such as the sliding date graph to easily see which days have the cheapest flights. And the explore section is broken, not allowing me to pick any dates"
2019,1,"Terrible experience. Even though you do find the cheapest flights, I was never able to pay for any of the options! I tried thousands of times through different sites and payment options but it always declined my cards (with enough funds) or told me the flight I wanted was sold out but then would show me the same flight after refreshing! Never using this app again."
2021,2,"Skyscanner used to be a good app. Multiple updates, though, have led to an inefficient interface. I'll never understand the need developers seem to feel to fiddle with things to make their apps worse than when they started. It's as though they don't understand how their users search for flights."
2022,4,"About 80% accurate. Does find you good deals, but not the best & most accurate; ultimately you need to search the official website of the airlines for final pricing. And you don't get refunds or any benefits from ordering tickets from 3rd party like Skyscanner."
2021,2,"Their new interface just does not work. Previously, I have been able to enter destination, dates, class etc all on the same screen. Now it requires multiple switches between screens, making it massive hassle"
2019,1,"I would commit murder, the app deliberately defaults to the wrong date when you input information so that you turn up at the airport on the wrong date. It's done this on me 3 times and I feel it's deliberately done so you book more last minute flights at higher prices. today I lost 900 pounds. I've tested on three android devices and it did that same on all three. scum"
2022,2,"wish it had a feature for a day range. means, setting up price alert for a range of day +2,3 so if a really good deal shows up within a couple of days before or after my target travel day, I may be able to make changes to my date and purchase the cheaper flights."
2019,3,It is nice app. Searches wide variety of ticket provider and recommends better rates. Can you make one improvement- During flight search I always need to select the date. Can you provide next and previous date navigations. Say Im searching flight for 6 November and I don't find one suiting my choice then I can select next and previous and it shows data of 7 nov or 5 nov date and so on. Currently i have open the calendar select 7 Nov
2020,1,"It used to be a pretty decent app, 4 stars but in the past 2 month or so there is minimum 100¬£, discrepancies between the shown price on skyscanner and the amount that the ticket costs, often hundreds more, Its been so bad so long I started using other apps a lot more, and would recommend not using sky scanner till they sort themselves out"
2022,1,"The prices are not updated until I click on a particular flight, so the initial price is very often wrong. And the cheapest option is not with the airline directly but with a third party, and it's a nightmare to book with any of them."
2019,5,The best and the easiest way to find out best flight options and keep track of price fluctuations. i love this. I love the comfort of being able to see different flight and hotel options and plan my vacations. Thanks Skyscanner team! You guys rock!!
2020,1,"Such a shame. Skyscanner is an awesome service on web. Their app does not make searches easy and it's difficult to compare flights, especially in a whole month. I can't help but wonder what in the heavens they were going for here. Just terrible!"
2021,1,"New interface is made so poorly, I think aviasales bought you to make it worse and dominate the market. It's either ultra counterintuitive to find or whole month and price graph options are missing, only coloured calendar that isn't obvious at all."
2022,1,"I'm loving it. I always use it to compare prices on tickets. 2022 edit: However, I don't love the fact that you block flights from and to Russia. Your political views are not of importance. Apparently I'll have to use other app to compare flights and actually flight to my home country (Greece) and maybe I'll stick to it. ""Obligation"" is an excuse in your case. ""Flexibility"" is the answer."
2020,1,"They have ruined the app, it's now so terrible, it's unusable. There was a way around it in the past by using your browser and not the app to access the site, now they have even ruined that. I am actively looking for alternatives to skyscanner now, again it's unusable."
2022,4,"Skyscanner is certainly my go to for any flight to anywhere every time. Like all good apps, it could be improved. 1. It is not possible to set filtering defaults. E.g if I will never fly with some airlines, I must remove them again with every search variation. 2. Multi flights are not handled well when added as a Trip. It is not possible to see the detail views of the flights. Instead the app tried to find updated prices for the originally selected class, but for only one pax an throws error."
2020,1,"Poor service from your Travelgenio Affiliate. They cancelled and rebooked my flight, so now I need to stay in the airport for 20 hours layover instead of 3hrs. I've tried to get in touch with them a couple of times but haven't gotten any response. Worse customer service and leaves me no good option."
2019,2,"Multi city option does not work when trying to book cabin class. if you try to book first of business, and just one of the flights doesn't have that option, it will say no flights available, instead of giving me the option to say yes to economy on that one short haul flight and first for the other flights."
2021,4,It seems like this app is going further and further in the wrong direction. I hate the logo change and rebranding. Why do people feel the need to change things that are already good? The new logo is ugly and makes the app hard to find in my arsenal of travel apps. It used to stand out and be my go-to. The search results and navigation is totally off now and hard to use. Will likely start using the other apps more.
2019,5,Absolute lifesaver in every possible way; really the best way to get cheap flights easily. I especially like their feature which allows you to choose a month/dates to travel in and it gives you the cheapest destination possible.
2022,3,"Utterly average. Found no advantage to using this app over any other, they're all exactly the same, present the same routes, omit the same airlines, etc. No unique functionality whatsoever. In the end I went to the airline websites directly and got better options and pricing."
2022,2,"Wanted to set up a price alert for a flight I need to book but is too expensive right now. Seems you can't save a flight alert through a normal flight search, you have to set up a trip. This is pretty unintuitive devs! Why can't I hit the bell icon for a flight I've found through the flight search?"
2019,5,"App was working great, but today it will not let me input departure and return dates. When I input departure date the return date defaults to departure date... This is was resolved by reinstalling the app. So far all is good...!!!! So from I'll rate it a 5 instead of 2 stars..!!!"
2023,5,"very intuitive, simple, planning a trip is much more easier with this app. would be great to also have trains and blablacar inside, to compare everything at the same time. The option from XXXXX to ""everywhere"" allows to spot last minute flights at a great price."
2023,5,"the update of price fluctuations is great, as are the 'explore everywhere' flights (although deals are often too short a period, sadly) but not as good, price wise, as before in comparison to other sites lately. However, Skyscanner will always be the first App I check."
2020,1,"This app is a waste of space. Can't even get the flights search page on as gets stuck on a black screen forever. Skyscanner you should know in this time and age, making an app this flawed available on the Play Store is hurting your rep. Get a decent product Dev/Assurance team. Switched to the website, hoping it won't crash..."
2020,1,"This is a bad app, and I used it for years. Loved it. Since Dec 2019 it has lost all appeal. AC was shown as well as most other airlines departing YTO. Now??? 1. No AC, 2. it doesn't give me the ""I am flexible "" option 3. Keeps bugging me to sign in..."
2021,1,"I used to love this app for its purpose and ease of use. But the latest UI is horrible, I swear. I am a frequent traveller and I always use Skyscanner to book my flights but I don't think I'll be continuing to use it any further. New update is making the UX so confusing. Please make changes."
2019,5,"Really easy to use. but more than that, it's reliable and often finds fare combinations that Kayak or Expedia could not. My favorite travel app so far. I managed to find a great business class fare with Austrian Airlines from Toronto to Tel Aviv, it was over $800 cheaper than the lowest prices option on Expedia! Good job Skyscanner, keep up the great work :)"
2021,2,"I loved this app until they introduced their updated version now I just hate it! It's so frustrating to have to go in everytime and choose an airport that isn't my local one. And the dates auto fill, what's with that! Stop it! I want to pick when I go on holiday and it won't be next week!!!"
2020,1,"New UX is a nightmare. Always picks the wrong starting city, no selection option for 'direct flights', sometimes I still get the good old UX but no idea how to get there. Really pushing for hotel bookings - feels like an alpha test release"
2022,3,"Explore tab is now on there however I can't actually explore anythinf, also please remove the double covid travel tab. When I open app sometimes I get a duplicate of the covid travel map, I want to explore all available flights but doesn't always give me that option. Thank you."
2021,1,"I loved this app and used it all the time, but since the last update I absolutely hate it and give up using it everytime I give it another try! It used to be really easy to find cheap flights by comparing prices from day to day, but I can't do this anymore. And I spent 5 minutes just trying to figure out how to search for a return flight rather than one way, which is ridiculous. I always recommended this app to my friends and family, but definitely won't now. Please, please change it back!"
2018,4,"Very good, but... Maybe you can add search by range of dates for direct travel. For example I want to fly 16 and I do not have a direct connection, but I already have 17. Now I have to look for every day, and I could mark from range to range. Departure from 16-19, return 28-30, I mark direct flights and decide what dates I am interested in. Sorting a longer stay, shorter stay, price."
2018,4,I would like if it had a symbol next to the price to state if luggage is included in each leg of the trip. This year the prices are very tricky because most of the airliners don't include luggage and you can be very surprised when it comes to pay.
2020,1,Made it much worse on new updates. Before you could bring up the dates on your flights and get a easy to see bar chart of prices. Now they've removed it with useless colour coded interface instead. Style over substance. Poor effort. Please add back in the prices bar chart.
2020,2,"What in thirteen hƒólls happened to this app?! It looks horrible now and its functionality is impeded by this shoddy new-age UI crud, for instance, by removing the multiple airport search options, option to search by month, etc. Please properly migrate all functionality before implementing a new interface."
2022,5,"Always my favorite site when planning flights to SE ASIA. The only negative is, most of the time the travel booking companies use BAIT AND SWITCH tactics. Low price shown, then after you've spent 10 minutes filling out the ticket information......they inform you that price has suddenly gone up. Would be nice if they would be honest. ‚úàÔ∏è"
2022,2,"Liked the previous design more. Feels like the step to see flight deatils is much longer and not easy on the eyes as before. I also dont like that it ""opens"" a new window with flight details rather than just expanding the info in the same window."
2019,3,"I give it 3 because, the app stil shows flight deals that are not available. It annoys me because it only stated the deals are unavailable when I'm about to make payments. It would be great if you'd filtered out the unavailable and only shows the available ones. Tq."
2021,3,Amazing app and very accurate. It was an amazing app now it's so hard to navigate and please change to what it was before. It does help but changes are still very hard to use for beginners..you will lose customers like this. make the app like Travelocity like it's was use to be
2022,2,"It is a good app for finding flights, but recent changes have made it far too difficult to manage price alerts on the mobile app. That's a key function that should not have been made this unintuitive."
2021,1,Annoying silly automatic search. You can't simply write locations from/to section. Every touch of you makes it search for something you don't want. So annoying. Plus this stupid automatic search is on at ios versions too. And UI is very confusing.
2021,2,I truly don't understand why this app doesn't have the ability to search for only direct flights using the explorer or everywhere destination search. Get your hopes up with these nice slope prices but then these absolutely ridiculous itineraries that no one would ever fly for a weekend trip. Essential feature missing.
2019,1,I don't know what happened to this app. You used to be able to select your airports and then it would show you the cheapest days. Now it forces you to pick dates. Which means I spend an hour going through week by week trying to find the cheapest flights. Google does a better job now than this does. This used to be my go-to app. Garbage now.
2021,1,"Worst app. I booked flight over Skyscanner through direct link and they cancelled my booking at last moment. And even the money was not refunded. Their customer care is a UK line and we have to spent ouroney again to call them. Even they won't help you at all. Dear folks, never book any tickets directly from the Skyscanner app or website. They are looting customers."
2023,1,"Absolutely useless, updating my 2017 review from when the app developers decided on killing the app. I deleted it and untill now, 2023, I've used the Web version as the app is totally useless. Now it seems using a newish modern android tablet, there's no way to check one way flights, so I downloaded the app again to see if I can find a one way ticket home. I see my 2017 review, but after this review I'll delete the app, it's 10X worse 6 years ago.. Doesn't even work, let alone be incomplete"
2020,3,"Why did you mess up a good thing? The app was perfect. . . now it's far from. Where is the ""whole month"" option. And once you click on a phone, the prices are half off the screen. It also looked better before."
2020,1,"If I have to book a ticket then, Out of 5 attempts 4 will get failure and there is no assurance that 5th attempt will get successful. Too much complicated and difficult application, each time when I book a ticket I face a payment failure issue where money get debited from account and then have to suffer for few days to refund for same. Skyscanner is only good at one point where customer don't get charged extra convenience charge, apart from that Skyscanner have nothing fruitfull to offer."
2022,1,"Skyscanner is a great way to select and pay for a flght. However, lately, Skyscanner glitsches and the screen of my tablet goes black and does not return to normal. I have to shut down down the tablet and restart it. So, Skyscanner is not working anymore."
2019,1,"It was a terrible experience booking a return return to KUL as it lead us to scoot and we was unable to make any payment(payment got declined) and unable to change the currency modes, and no options available to book a two way tickets mapshot. Please don't take this lightly, this is something you guys have to look into, as you guys wouldn't be bearing our flight cost as well...."
2019,2,"Something really gone wrong since couple updates ago. The search for flights to ""everywhere"" simply stopped offering any suggestions (I mean literally none!). Too bad as it's my most common method of searching for possible flight destinations. Will probably keep looking on other platforms."
2019,2,"best website for airlines, hands down. worst app to find a flight, ever. skyscanners greatest thing they offer is ""cheapest month"" while searching and the app doesn't have that. it also takes soooo much longer to find the flights than it takes to find the same flights on their website. skip the app, use the website."
2020,1,Ripped off Booked a flight they stuffed up my spelling on the booking. 3days to get an amendment done they said it was my error (which it was not). They told me I have to pay to get name change i ended up saying I would. Then the link would not work to make payment tried different cards still no good told me link expires 30mins after sent so waited another 4 hours caught email straight away still no good tried from laptop still no good after 6 days I gave up after so many calls waisted time.
2019,5,"amazing app I have used it for many years...best way to find cheap flights from any destination... I would love it if you implemented a ""to destination"" for example let's say I want to go rome, Italy in June, I would like to see all flights flying to Rome so I can see which is the cheapest destination to get there, this would be excellent"
2021,2,"this used to be a great app. Now it's buggy: doesn't show accurate information regarding pricing, and is inconsistent with search results. you have to shut down and open it back up again to have it function properly."
2020,1,Used to love skyscanner.... Used it for many years. But the latest version is appalling. Can't even choose single trip and almost impossible to select specific dates. Absolutely useless app now - you need to sack your software design team.. Uninstall
2020,1,New interface is absolute garbage. Worst interface ever. Old interface was way better. Everyone wants to upgrade the system so that it is easy and better but i feel Skyscanner is downgrading.
2020,1,Went from best to useless It is a shame what happened to this app. I thought it was supposed to help us finding best prices and connections. You used to be able to compare prices through months. This feature is gone. I went back to kayak which i also don't like lol
2019,1,"Looks good, but can't log in using Google account. The application redirect to browser and show ""Check your network settings"" error message. Without logging in the application not very useful. Will uninstall it and install something more reliable."
2021,4,"they have changed the app , stepback, now it's more complicated to search for undecided flights. *Edit , now they have improved it again and the ""explore"" button is at the bottom of the main page."
2021,4,April 2021 update: Not used in anger out in the field so remains at 4 stars. I can say however it is the app of choice now and for flights nice and slick. I can barely wait to again be stuck in a jungle and use skyscanner to get me out..... So 5 stars it will have when I am 100% reassured there is no return to a design dead end. Please don't change the flight pages sequence. But all good !
2021,1,The application is totally non user experience at the moment. It so difficult and confusing to put your airport and the destination that you want to go. Please change the app.
2021,1,Still no fix. same stated previous issues.. I use multi citi search. Never heard back from developer after posted my review 3 months ago. Poor app. Lose all trip search if I hit back to edit dates. Can't do changes period. Have to start over on multiple citi flights. Better use a different app to avoid mental stress
2020,1,This app has changed for the worse. You are no longer able to tailor your trip days to get the cheapest flights or see price fluctuations for different days. Less choice and information provided. There is no point in having this app without that
2021,1,The latest version is too pathetic. I'm confused with UI. Most the time figuring out where to go and from. Absolute app UI is made for aliens or UI manager loves Sci-Fi movies. Older version was better.
2021,1,You have destroied a fantastic app. Really difficult and unintuitive choosing a date and from where to. I need to juggle 15 minutes to get the way. Get back to the old UI as this look like to be designed by a group of drunk monkey
2022,1,"The app was so great before. Since the update you've lost so many of the features, its bloody awful!! It used to be my go to for searching but now I find it easy & more reliable to search the various providers myself."
2021,1,The app was upgraded and became much less intuitive. I suddenly cannot find some of the best functionality I was using in the past (i.e. Search for a whole month's prices and choose dates flexibly)
2022,1,Why is there no option at the beginning of searching for Direct Flights only?! The fact you have to manually alter this for each individual city you select is so annoying. Gone back to using the website on my browser as app is just irritating.
2022,1,"Why the app is different than the browser, and work differently and complicated. Web browser goes to the point, easy to explore options alternatives, the android app is nothing like that!"
2021,2,"I used to absolutely love Skyscanner because of the prices graph comparison, but the new app redesign ditched it, such a bummer! And I don't know if it is because of Covid but there's so many less flights and cheap flights available?"
2018,2,"Has the potential. However, I can't believe that I am unable to set a trip length and custom date range in the explore feature. This would complete the app (along with allowing a multi city explore)"
2022,1,This is probably the single most infuriating app I've seen in a lifetime. Just show me the direct flights please.....let me choose multiple departure points. whoever has designed the usability on this is either insane or has never booked flights before. I give up! Arrrrrrgggggh...
2022,3,"Please provide the following search filters - Checked-in baggage, No Self-transfer, airline filters during the search for everywhere in the app and the website!! These are much needed. Browsing on the app/website is becoming hard due to the absence of such filters!"
2020,1,"Why the hell is it I'm being asked to switch accounts when trying to seek some help about an upcoming trip!! The message says - please log in using the same account as the booking - I only have 1 email address, why would it ask me to switch! I booked my flights through you 2 hours ago, god knows why, and I'm already getting greif and stress because of this! Unbelievable. Seriously regret doing this."
2019,2,"Multi-city is poorly done. You should allow to chose different classes and if direct, 1 stop or 2 stops for the individual legs. Otherwise the multi-city is a tool that can't be really used. Cheers"
2022,2,"This new version sucks - the interface isn't intuitive, you have to hit search before it will load. My app routinely tells me that no flights exist, we Google flights will display hundreds of flights for the same dates. Used to be the best, basically useless now."
2021,5,"Skyscanner Pro unlike in the lite version you have there extra features, call me I can send you a copy. The lite version is the well known copy of the previous one only renamed, all databases get updated automatically so u know u can always have an impression that it is always a new version each time you type in a new word in that. Hold on not so fast. The major upgrades are planned out to be from the 23rd of December and soon after only 1 time hearing, no limits, ultra healthy."
2021,2,This app used to be so good with the new update I click on flight it does not me let chose the destination it just goes random like a yo yo...I have to uninstall for it to work properly again...then after a couple of searches it goes back to not working at all...fix it.when you do I will give back the 5 stars
2021,1,"The new redesign is a total mess. Hard to navigate, understand, and goes to very strange and unfriendly paths for users. Please go back to previous version."
2022,1,What on earth has gone wrong with Skyscanner? The search functionality and explore is completely unusable. Half the time the explore function doesn't even appear. I'm done with Skyscanner.
2019,5,"Easy to use. 9 out of 10 time, it provides the widest and cheapest options. Definitely my go-to app for finding flights. I will pair this with Trivago to find hotels. Most times, using separate sites give cheaper options than the ones provided by sites such aw Expedia."
2023,1,"Absolutely useless, it advertising bargain flights for sure but the price doubles when you click on it. This happens with all flights all thr time. Don't waste you time, it quicker and cheaper to search yourself."
2020,2,"Very poor compared to the website. Not very intuitive to use, and the big failing is you can't specify direct flights only unless looking at a specific route so all the general search options are pretty useless"
2020,1,"Can you explain why the return journey cost changes if I change my fly out day? Also why it doesn't offer the cheapest flight on that day? How can the flight cost vary depending on the day I fly out when the day of return is the same? If I book 2 singles it works out cheaper than your app shows is available for a return. The price of the return flight can increase 50% for the exact same flight home, why? Also, sometimes it even hides that cheaper return flight and only offers the more expensive"
2021,2,Primary purpose of the app was to find the cheapest flight combinations across various dates. This is becoming harder and harder with every new update since the removal of the whole month calendar.
2021,1,"Booking was not confirmed for days and then removed from the ""Your Trips"" page, so I could not relay my booking information to the actual airline to clear things up. Had to do the booking all over again, using a different platform, of course."
2021,1,"It used to be such a good app, but it's rubbish now. Keeps searching for the last flight that I searched for. Every time I open the app! No way of going back to a new search without going to phone settings and clearing the app cache üòï"
2022,5,I love skyscanner.I actually found out about the app on a social media platform and I'm so glad that I did . I've saved soooo much money with this app and it's very informative and what I love is the alerts you get for price increases and decreases on flights and hotels I've even got great rates on car rentals. Get this app don't hesitate it's Great!!!!
2022,1,"You are allowing scamming websites on your webpage. What's your credibility in the process of ticket booking when you allow such websites on your portal? We booked our flights through Travelgenio and there's no way of contacting them through phone or email. They simply aren't picking up calls and we booked the tickets thinking Skyscanner has redirected us so it would be a credible site, but I'm really disappointed with the scam that I made a part of."
2020,1,How this app passed usability tests? Most website features are striped out to them point that it is impossible to book a car rental in London. The result list doesn't even show the actual location of car rental other than some useless generic terms like 'terminal airport'.
2021,3,"It's straightforward enough but it really isn't any different than looking up flights on Google. Especially because I can't save flights to trips anymore. Not sure what happened there. This used to be a special app that did things differently, but now it's just not."
2023,1,"Piece of garbage, the support is a disaster, use the platform to check the flights but buy them directly from the airline, otherwise the airline won't be able to change the flights if something happens, they will charge you again it doesn't matter if it is a covid issue. It took more than 2 weeks to give me dates for the new flight and 5 days to confirm the flight I have paid. Every single time the rep told me they will call me or email me and no once they did that. I already talked to soport..."
2020,1,"They are trying to Steal my money in the hard times of Covid19. My flight was canceled and they told me I couldn't get a full refund and instead I could change the date. Now they can't confirm if the flight will take off on that date, and due to visa restrictions I cant stay any longer. They are not ready to help me of even receive my calls. Pathetic ."
2023,3,"Unable to select airport, waiting time is too long, date selection is not applied. I select August, it searches in June. Waste of time I'll try again, maybe there was a fluctuation in the service."
2019,1,"The new version is so bad that it is a torture to find a suitable flight now. It used to be very practical and user-friendly, but not anymore. You need to talk to your app developers and find out who decided to make the app like this and why. Super disappointing."
2019,4,"Great app. Seems to be an issue at the moment with additional passengers (children in particular) where even though they have been selected, they need to be added again on the airline website. Usual have to start all over again."
2019,5,"Love the app! Have been using it for years. Wanted to share the app with a friend but found it quite effortful. (Or maybe I am being blind on a Saturday morning, heheh). Would be great to have an easy sharing feature within the app (especially if followed by a little reward;) ). So far had to go to the Play Store to share."
2023,5,"I like to use sky scanner app to check flight out before booking for trip so who ever is booking my flights maybe not up to date on what flights are available in my area.if the flight doesn't work for me. I just ask if I can make a change to their booking or if they are aware that I see another flight that leave sooner,cost same or less. Can we change it ,if so they will and that's why I use it."
2021,1,"I booked a flight using this app via my credit card. I was already charged but I haven't received my booking confirmation or ticket thru my email. The 72 hours window have already passed. I had file complaints already but to no avail. Base on this experience, I think this app is dangerous to use. Other's be aware!!!!"
2022,1,"I had a extremely bad experience for the ticket booking, after booking using Skyscanner -( Budget ticket) they had not shared any confirmation ticket details till the travel date. So last minute I booked another ticket with very high price. I applied for the Refund but didn't not receive any reply yet. Also several time I tried to connect with the customer care but this service seems too poor to connect the call even."
2023,1,Spent 2 (classical) hours trying to rent a car. Entering same details 10 times. Each time a new issue. Finally payment goes through only to see it fail with money charged... We know a lot of people waste time booking on various sites. Why are they all designed so poorly ? Using same libraries ? Its amazing how poor almost everyone can make it.
2021,5,I love how it lays out ALL the airlines. I always pick the fastest üòÅ Saving money is great. I would rather cherish my timeüíû my time and energy are way more valuable then saving a couple hundred bucksüòÅ with this app I can filter for the fast flights with minimum layoversüòÅ
2021,1,"This app was great for felxible travel and ie. Choosing country, and variable date ranges to see best flight prices. They must have recently resigned the app and I no longer see that option of searching. Such a loss."
2019,4,"best I've found for flying Aus-Philippines. Although when I click on the cheapest with short flight times, the original price is suddenly bumped up after selecting? Hopefully its a mistake or else I will uninstall and edit this reveiw?"
2019,1,"dysfunctional. Nothing happens when i click either the airplane, hotel, or car rental icons to search. i had the app for about a month and now all the sudden it's not working. Now i may have to ditch this app, cancel the membership, and go elsewhere. such a shame as I was still exploring it's different features and services"
2020,5,Trying to book with ease is a past option.. The hassle to find out if your luggage is part of the booking is a disaster.. Multiple booking option should be great trying to find out about luggage has made the site unremarkable and far from what it was... The option for luggage should be there for any booking you make.. And if you prefare no luggage for cheaper let that be easily shown to make ease of finding your flight better and not frustrating as it is now....
2020,1,"Beware. They use disreputable agencies to sell you cheap tickets. I lost $1,400 using this app. The agency Skyscanner sent me to (Travel2be) does not answer calls. They put you on hold and waste your time before eventually disconnecting the call every time. Nobody answers emails or web help requests. Flights ruined. Money gone. Nobody cares. Contacted skyscanner for help. Sorry. No help from them either. Beware. Buy your tickets directly from the airline. They are always there to help."
2019,2,"The new UX is a downgrade. The search screen now doesn't let us continue from where you left off. Having the new ""wizard"" search ux sucks because if you go back you have to re-input all your choices. Bring back the old search page."
2021,1,"Will not use their services anymore. After I bought plane tickets that were cancelled because of COVID, I asked for a refund and they basically told me to contact the airline that had issued a voucher, while I never requested a voucher (which is non refundable), and wouldn't solve the refund for me. This is not the kind of service I was expecting from Skyscanner. I am using their services so I don't have to go through the hassle of dealing with the airlines. Very disapointed."
2023,1,Stopped working after my recent update on Galaxy Tab. Searches for hotels and cars works fine but I am unable to search for flights. When entering search 'From' the dialog box appears but I cannot see or enter city name. Same thing happening on when I try to enter destination airport.
2019,5,"The most cost saving application I have ever used. I swear by it for all my international travel for the last 4 years. I would love to see more ""Save this trip"" features beyond what is available today, or a ""leave and return a day later and you could save X"" type of recommendation."
2019,4,"I like the ability to look for flights by month and save them. I would like a feature where we can look by cheapest month like on the desktop site. I also wish the green dots meaning the available flights actually showed the price before clicking on the day, because it ranges from $500-900 ish."
2021,3,"Lacking a few functions which it's competitors have. One useful feature which they don't have js the ability to set an impricise date of travel. In other words, setting a date and telling the app to look for flights 3 days before and after the date"
2021,1,"Absolutely terrible company and horrible customer service! Do not use this company , you are much better to book directly with the airlines. I had to cancel a flight due to covid and was told I would get a refund within 12 to 14 weeks, it has now been over 7 and a hf months and nothing, I keep getting the same copy and paste responses by them and they have removed their phone number from their website and are very hard to get ahold of. Overall super unprofessional."
2019,5,Great app. Very easy to navigate.... makes booking flights 'a doddle'.... with confidence knowing you're getting the best deals. I've used in numerous times. Search engine is so quick and its surprising the great prices that appear on the screen giving amazing options for travel and accommodation
2018,1,"So this app shows me cheap flights. As I want to book them, all of a sudden, they're no longer available for that price. Then the very next day it still shows the cheap flights! Why list cheap flights that's not available! Such a waste of time!"
2019,4,"My go to app for finding flights. Unfortunately the hotel search is unusable for families. I can only search for for a room based on the number of adults, rather than being able to search for 2 adults and 1 infant like I can on Trivago and others."
2021,1,"Really amazing concept created but totally misleading. The final booking prices are crazy expensive than the explore everywhere option. Even with Flexible Dates, it show 50-70% higher fares than what it had shown earlier."
2022,2,"App isn't as good as desktop version (which is great!). The app doesn't have as many filter options, such as the option to show direct flights only."
2021,4,I really like the platform. I always use it for searching flights. But the new interface of the mobile app is confusing and unpractical in comparison to the previous version.
2021,5,"I have suggested skyscanner to atleast 100 people in my circle because I loved it for my business travels with such ease, unfortunately your new user interface is terrible, I am not able to surf it like before. Please get it back to normal mode as it was, because it is a disaster this way. I am hoping it gets resolved or else the only option is to remove it."
2019,4,Useful for keeping track of flights and prices. Good for setting up alerts on flights as well. Would be nice if you could manually delete individual recent searches.
2018,3,"Until recently, I would have rated this app at 5 stars. However, the widget stopped updating awhile back, and now it looks like the widget is missing altogether. The widget was one of the biggest advantages of having the app."
2019,1,The app doesn't find flights which the website finds easily. It's built well but the search is bad. Following the response... The new app doesn't allow me to search the entire month anymore. I saw your response to another customer but it isn't an option.
2018,1,"What the heck happened to your app??? It's literally perplexing now and so utterly frustrating to use. It has random obscure pop ups, it constantly freezes, now does the bizarre 'we think we know better so here's our suggestion....you wanted 6 weeks in Sri Lanka...how about a week in Russia instead,...such a disappointment now"
2019,5,"not working. it just bounces out. After i ""forced stop"" and cleared the cache, it works properly. thanks for the fast tech support. i changed my rating as well. you guys are great. i wish every app had a tech team like that."
2020,1,"Fast searching, cheap prices. But... I can't choose flights with or without baggage! Guys, it's important, why didn't you add that function? :/ Also it doesn't have calendar with prices... Ugh."
2019,3,"This is genuinely a great app that helped me a ton with price comparing and buying tickets for an upcoming trip. however, did something happen in the last update? for some reason in Upcoming Trips, there's no longer an option to enter flight info (did I dream that's how I added my last flights?) and no matter what I search on what date, it tells me there's no flights for the route. v frustrating, I really liked that feature"
2020,4,"A small bug. When I have selected a date range for my trip for Dubai, post that all the price of hotels are displayed duration of the stay and not per night. Even after selecting price as per night, it's still displaying price of hotel as duration of 7 days and not per night"
2022,1,Doesn't show the actual price... It maybe runs through websites once a day... I always see a very huge price difference.. Skyscanner shows very cheap price where as when u book it.. It suddenly jumps to literally double the price
2018,1,"Always have fake prise on the 1st page, and if you click to see it then suddenly cost changes... for example I was checking the prise on 12th Oct around 3:27 PM FROM KOCHI TO KUALA LUMPUR DATED 28TH oct to 31st Oct.. oh was showing ‚Çπ7417 And after clicked it, cheapest was ‚Çπ10083. I have never used this app at all and I suggest you not to use Bcz they fake the prise on their portal.. going to unstall it..."
2018,1,How could they get this so wrong? I just want to search flights. That's what you use skyscanner for. Flooded with a load of unrequested information. Couldn't even provide flight information on the dates requested. Gave up after 5 minutes. Uninstalled!
2022,5,It is a must have app for all those who book tickets online. There's a significant difference in flight tickets cost on respective websites vs Skyscanner. The price here is always less and it helps us in making informed decisions.
2021,2,You want specific recommendations. Just go back to the way the app worked past year. I removed your app and probably wont redownload it. Sorry after getting used to how good it was. I used to recommend your app to a lot if people in airports. There's nothing good about the new interface so that wont be happening again.
2022,5,Overall i love the app that's why the 5star however a point to maybe work on would be the following. To complete your profile you MUST have other traveler added. I primarily do these booking alone (and know there are many others as well) so for now a suggestion would be to have this as optional to complete the profile and not as a must.
2023,1,Haha... i thought lowered price for real but when you are about to booking .. suddenly pops on the screen and saying price has been revised which is equal to all price of other booking partner agencies. so i tried it for 20 minutes and uninstall it as soon as i found it
2022,3,I booked a ticket but my passport informations werent asked. How is it possible to book a ticket without passport information? Years ago I used this app to book tickets but at that time nothing was wrong I had entered all my passport information also and could check that ticket wherever I want. Now it is suspicious that passport information isnt asked and cannot check the ticket. Anyone who can answer?
2020,1,"I checked the app this morning and it was the old format, I really did believe it had been changed back. Unfortunately not so, I am trying to book several flights and it's a complete disaster. Please bring back the old version."
2021,1,"App keeps crashing. I used to use this app all the time for flights, just opened it after a year of not travelling and when I select the flight I chose it just crashes. App is useless now. I have the new version too it says it was updated may 17"
2019,1,"Skyscanner now a days tied up with few agents which does not have any credibility, before buying the tickets ( cheaper than other options) , please do check the authenticity and feedback of individual agencies as there are many separate T& C applied. I think as an aggregator Skyscanner should xheck also the credibility of individual agencies and tie up onoy with trusted and credible ones."
2020,1,"Hello And again this app back to that design I really dislike I wrote about it about 8 months ago but u decided to do again... I really prefer to chose myself first from to to where fly then chose date etc not like pushing in front of me right away calendar "" wanna fly today, this weekend etc and then next u trace my location to nearest airport ? Nope ...if this won't change ...its time to uninstall this app cos there is plenty other app on market..."
2020,2,"Unable to create a trip for some flights with Greener Choices. It displays the message ""something went wrong"". Tried reinstalling the app but unable to do so either."
2020,1,"this used to be the best for finding flights and recently it has linked itself to a site called kiss and fly and all the prices are off by up to $200. furthermore, you can't book through kiss and fly even if their prices were legit unless you have a passport. that goes for domestic flights too and children. so skyscanner is essentially useless now because of the use of kiss and fly. change that and I will change my review"
2019,2,"I used to use it as my first app, but it doesn't have all results for some flights. I don't get direct flights, while I know there are such because I can see it in the Ryanair's app for the same date range. Looks nice, works nice but I don't trust it anymore."
2021,1,One star vote for a simple reason: initial price listed is wildly off from the price quote in the following screen. The help section does not adequately explain this discrepancy and it doesn't matter anyway--if there is to be any significant difference just don't show the price at all.
2022,1,"Skyscanner used to be Fly Far. They scammed me and so many other people by selling travel insurance that made it appear it was insuring your trip. NOT! Do not be fooled. They misrepresented so bad they changed thier corporate location and name to Sky Scanner. Now all the people who were taken advantage of and lost money from trip cancelations have no one to sue. Not long till more turmoil will pour out and so many will be screwed over as well. They are quick money takers, and will change name."
2021,3,"Now even the flight details are gone. First the price graph, now we cannot see the plane type or the meal option. Are you preparing a paid version? I'm loving the app less and less. ----------------------------------------- Reply to your reply: Just bring back the price graph and the flight details (plane type, meal option, etc) and I will be a happy man :)"
2019,2,"Curret app finding not best deals. Like example I founded 1 deal in shyscanner and exactly same in Ryanair. Difference around ¬£60 Ryanair won. And string after I founded another deal better then in skyscanner. May be it work sometimes but, I prefer searching mu self and I will sure I really fimd best deals."
2019,1,it was a very 1st time i used this and got so many issues. Keeps loading and after the transactions has been made i just got a confirmation that cannot be proceeded due to authirization of payment. Whats happening in this way. I have no issues with thw bank.
2019,1,"Loved this app before the new update. It would tell me the cheapest, 2nd cheapest, shortest, 2nd shortest and rate the flights between 1-10. Now it just shows the price and nothing else. Uninstalling."
2022,1,"The app is very confusing, they push what they want you to buy prior to what is good for you. Their customers are clearly the airlines, not the users. The website (with a computer) on the other hand is still quite good"
2022,5,"Got the best price through the app. Good thing is that you can see the rates of all websites in real time. Hence, getting the best rates after comparing all the providers. Overall great user experience. Totally recommend this one."
2021,1,"Last update was catastrophic in my opinion. Some functionalities were lost (like statistics view) and the new graphics overall is just a horrible mess. Please throw it away and go back to normal, the app is unusable!"
2019,3,This app is good for checking out flight but when you go to the websites it's a pain if you make a mistake and want to go back as it takes you allllllll the way to the first page and you have to imput your details once again. This is not the apps fault but the websites themselves.
2021,1,"The new interface for search flight now is pain in the ass.. for example i want search flight from Kuala Lumpur to London, i cant switch from London to Kuala Lumpur easiy (Cant change directly Where to, first I have to change in From then change Where to)... U have simple and easy interface before.. Why you change it to such confusing one? I hate it"
2022,1,"Hi I like Skyscanner but when I did booking and confirmed from Travelgenio, they said airlines changed the time. Since last one month, I am trying to return my money. Neither they return nor respond properly. Even we can't contact thru any means. Please remove Travelgenio from Skyscanner. My booking reference is 20015844."
2019,5,"We've found some amazing flights through this site! Generally I search both roundtrip and one way to get the best prices (400 roundtrip from west coast US to Germany, $280 roundtrip to Iceland, etc.) I love the search everywhere feature and searching by month rather than specific dates."
2022,1,"Some flights missing. I'm adding this following your reply: even the link you asked me to use it's not adequate. JSo in order to help youo, just advise your team to check Corsair flights. It was a quick check so for sure others should missing as well"
2021,1,"Used to be great...what HAVE YOU done to it??? Did no-one try it before the releaseüôÑ wasted 20 minutes trying to do a simple to and from, based on countless previous, and successful times!!! Gave up, and moved to another platform...still shaking my head!"
2023,3,"Slower than before. It takes 3-4 seconds to find an airport code, while those should be cached somewhere. Selecting dates is horrendous. This app used to be the best, now it's really bad."
2021,1,Worst app bcz i had booked a ticket on 11th jan from kochi to london. Due to some issues i deside to prepond my journey so that i cancelled the ticket on 11th but it's not an easy task bcz this app have no option for cancellling so that i spend 1 more day to contact the flight service agency one of them i got easily (indigo) another one is emrites i spend more time to contact them bcz they have customer care number bt we couldnt connect. Do trust this app
2020,2,"What happened? Why you guys updated the app to a more difficult way for research ? Now we dont have an easy access to the price as before. It's awful ! Please, focus on your public who is trying to find cheap prices to travel! The others go in agencies!"
2021,1,"Used to be good app a year ago, but now its useless. Search function doesn't work properly, terrible interface, buggy, etc... Hope will get back to good old days, till then - uninstall."
2019,5,"I am in love with this app, the best part about the search is that you can actually look on the calander and it will tell you which days will be cheaper! It makes planing trips extremely convient! I've not found anything better! Definitely would recommend downloading this app!"
2021,1,"Use to use this app for flight comparisons where you could look at month as a whole, but this new update is so useless and app has lost its competitive edge over your average run of the mill competition. Never known a business to deliberately decided to kill their own model so quickly like these guys. Absolutely shocking EDITED : shocking, just found out how to use the whole of month search function, absolutely stupid, but have to use skyscanner website and click whole of month"
2019,3,It would be great if i was able to say i want a 4 week trip to a certain place at anytime at the best deal. I have yet to find any app or website that does this. All the great prices are for 7 to 10 day vacations.
2019,5,"Updated: I bought international plane tickets through EXPLORETRIP at $1,053. After I received the e-ticket, within minutes a rep said my 3 hour layover is now 18 hours contrary to their confirmation. I said I want to cancel but she said I can have the SAME FLIGHT I BOOKED for $54 more. This experience was very distasteful. However, Skyscanner rep followed through and within a day EXPLORETRIP said they'll refund $54 within 7-10 business days. Skyscanner is very effective in protecting its users!!"
2020,1,I hate leaving a negative review and generally you don't deserve a 1 star review. The new search functionality on your mobile site and app is horrible. I regularly use your service but you have made it so difficult to search. Also where has your cheapest month gone. Please keep this all on one screen. If I am being A/B tested please give me the old option please please please
2021,1,"I don't think I have ever used a more infuriating application. Fire whoever made the decisions on the UI and UX. Deleted after 5 minutes of simply trying to find flights, will go back to web based version."
2019,1,The latest update has ruined the best app for searching flights.. they removed the feature that allowed you to view the cheapest flight to your destination on every day then allowed you to make a selection. Now very hard to use !
2019,4,"found it easy and helpful. but when i check for the flight from the same place to the same destination the price varies everytime. it always goes high. one if my friend who booked a flight ticket at 390 gbp for the same flight is showing me ¬£500 & above, no matter how many time I check & the time I book. So much Disappointed for this. The price increment baaed on necessity. If I check for july/August/September in the month of april, still the prices are high. even for June there are high again."
2019,2,"good app. just having trouble with adding dates for notifications. some of the numbers of the days are being covered with the names of the months. please fix this glitch. I can't say the app is good for price alerts, because I can't click on the dates."
2022,1,This app went down the hill. I remembered it being useful at the beginning and now it only wastes my time. The direct flights only option is introduced too late in the search.
2019,5,"Very easy to use and flight tickets are comparatively cheap. But alternative method of booking through internet banking, as we do on Indian cites, must be added. Every body is not necessarily having credit cards in India."
2019,1,The prices it first quoted are often much higher when you go to view the flights. Can be 2 or 3 times the original quoted price. The app used to work very well but recent changes reduce it's usefulness.
2023,1,"Annoying! This app is just playing with you. On the screen is one price, when you click it's another, when you are want to buy even higher! The same thing when you check prices, then open the app again and that ticket is no there anymore!!!"
2019,1,Update is rubbish. The design is ugly but who cares when you cant even save flights to trips. Makes it pointless for someone trying to track a few different flights. May as well just use Google flights at least it works
2019,1,"Yesterday I was searching for a flight ticket from LAX going to DEN,and I used this crappy app.I found the ticket,and ready for the payment,but the web page won't came out,it just keep processing,and then finally it told me the ticket I'm looking for is no longer exist,ok then,I used another app ordered another fight ticket,but then I received 2 e-mails from 2 different airlines!I bought 2 tickets!And both of them are basic economy seats which means I probably won't get the refunds!damn the app!"
2023,2,"Skyscanner Brazil have to take a look in few companies like Chalinga reviews on Google, another thing is getting harder to pay using credit cards as we want to pay in installments like monthly payments. Make it easy for customers to plan ahead their trips and easier access for everyone to travel. I am talking in international level. Before was very easy to get tickets to pay using this way but now only few websites are offering this service."
2019,5,"I made a flight tickets reservation from this app, it showed me the price in the beginning, but when the payment was processed on the website, an extra 50 USD were withdrawn. i was so disappointed, but when i contacted the support team of skyscanner they followed it up with the agency and returned the difference in less than 12 hours."
2022,1,I have used this app the prices of flight tickets were too less as compared to others but it is connected with other app so it doesn't help me the price on other platforms it connected were not same so we cannot book with the same price as awailable on the Skyscanner app Not helpful app.
2023,1,"It just works bad. You open the calendar and it tells you certain prices, but once you hit search, you see totally different prices. I've been using this app for years, but right now I'm looking for a replacement."
2019,5,"It's such a handy app, allows you to view the price range of days, before you select the day itself. It's really really easy to use, I find it so stress free when looking for flights through Skyscanner"
2019,4,Could you add a feature of reverse search. You have explore from one destination to everywhere but I would like to see explore from everywhere to a particular destination.
2019,1,"would give lower if it were possible. pressed the wrong date as i said i was paying. Contacted immediately (same minute) as the payment was pending and wanted to change the date yet i sat waiting until it went through before they told me they dont change flights, names or refund tickets. basically 0 allowance for anything and will just pocket your money. look it up but DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THEM."
2022,3,"Your app has a problem. Flights to Bangkok are only showing car hire and hotels. I've only changed the return date by a day. Hundreds of flights available but only showing cars and hotels. Sort it out, very bad. This is after updating the app"
2023,5,"Never fails to help me find the cheapest and best flights. For how often I travel alone and for short periods of time this is GREAT! Just remember that there's a reason why buying from 3rd parties is cheaper, always check add-on prices like baggage or seating."
2023,5,Wonderful app and easy to use...got flight deal in an amazing and cheapest price...best app to book flight must go...sharing personal experience ‚ù§Ô∏è
2021,3,"Dropping the star rating, I believe the CJ isn't as good for searching flights. Although it's tried to be a more simplified view I find it harder to navigate to filter options"
2019,1,"Does not show prices of flights for whole months like on the website, witch is the only reason I use Skyscanner. The app only shows range of prices and you have to choose the dates to see the prices instead of choosing date after seeing prices on the calendar. I guess i will have to keep using the website if i want to use Skyscanner services."
2021,3,"It used to be one of the best Android apps. However, now it looks like it has been rewritten using some multi platform framework which has introduced various UI bugs (e.g. scrolling in settings) and in general degradated responsivity."
2022,1,"What happened to this app? Reinstalled now I'm traveling more and it's a mess. Filters clearing when navigating, UI update is horrible, prices shown on days don't match the search later on, can't even find the previous price graph..... It used to be simple, clean and functional üòê"
2023,3,"I like Skyscanner but I can't filter searching for direct flights only. I've followed the instructions in the FAQ but there is never a ""sort/filter"" option in my results. The website has a direct-only toggle but using it on my mobile just forwards to the app anyway, which then ignores it. I'd give five stars if I could filter for direct flights only in the app."
2019,1,"This was my go to service when my family was traveling around the world on the cheap last year. Now, they are scammy like many other services I avoid. By this I mean you search, see a very low price result, click, see it's actually much much higher, click again and even higher. They will say it's just ""estimated"" prices on the first result. Why? Your giving me the actual list of prices eventually.. terribly disappointed. Uninstalled and done."
2018,1,"Well this app worked great up til my actual trip and then all hell broke loose. Disaster after disaster with flights saying they were on time only to turn up and find them cancelled and rebooked on flights that took me past where i wanted to get only to get another flight back to my chosen destination making me miss half a day. Then there was the flexible ticket that wasn't flexible. They did book me on another flight home, but the information i kept getting sent to my phone was on my original rtn and not the new one leaving me to try and find where and when and with whom i was flying with. Then i turned up at the airport and was told i had to pay more money another $100 for a flight which im sure if i had time i could have found cheaper somewhere else. I kept calling customer services for help and they were no help whatsoever saying to pay the money and attempt to get a refund but to be honest i can't see that happening as they never call me back like they say, send me emails like they say or solve the problem like they say. Complete and utter joke. Wasted hours trying to sort this out and it has put a dampener on my trip that was meant to be enjoyable. I will never use this app or gotogate ever again"
2021,2,"I use to love this app, as it actually found good deals and was very useful for searching to find the cheapest days to travel. The prices are the same as a google search now and the search function seems way more limited. Not useful anymore, uninstalling and looking for a new app to replace what this app use to be."
2020,1,Has gone from hero to zero. Can't select multi city itineraries any more and can't even find an option to search for business or first class flights. The search page is cluttered and confusing now. Will be uninstalling this app and moving to Momodo from here on.
2023,1,"It's best to use the web version...the app is a joke (selecting months, playing with dates, destinations, etc...is uneccessarily difficult). Delete the app and use the web or use the phone and select ""desktop site"" on chrome or something..."
2022,4,"I've used skyscanner since 2016 and it is a very incredible app. I enjoy using it but the current upgraded UI has me confused in some areas however, I'm sure it just needs a little getting used to."
2021,1,"This app is awful , why change something that was perfect to this mess , do the developers never try out what they created ? Going to remove/uninstall from my phone. Update...its actually worse than imagined, you have done irreparable damage to your name , and senior management should be fired, its actually unbelievable how a company can be so stupid to think this app is ok to go public , worse failure in the history of apps. Uninstalling now."
2022,4,"I wasn't sure if it was cap or not but if your new to making trips like me and don't know how to put your info to from jotted notes to easy planning. From budgeting to activities around where ever you go, you name it and this app makes it possible."
2021,1,"Super Buggy search function is worthless. Was a decent app for quickly finding flights. Now for example I tried searching flights into Oakland CA. It does not pull up. You can type in Oakland and it'll pull up a couple of Oakland related areas back East but not Oakland, CA."
2020,1,"Was once a good app which I used frequently but now totally confusing and unclear. Just removed it from my phone. Was not able to find a clear page where I can insert departure-, arrival airport and date! Instead stupid suggestions which are totally useless! NOT RECOMMEND APP"
2021,2,After update the app is almost unusable. Can't select the flexible dates. Changing the dates is a nightmare. Have to use desktop version instead. Is there any way to downgrade it to the old version?
2022,1,"Keeps asking to verify I'm a person, I do so, just kicks me back to the same annoying screen, sometime immediately, sometimes after looking at a few things. So off to other apps rhay are not as annoying to use."
2019,1,Prior to this last upgrade Skyscanner was excellent now it sucks used it for the last few years not much longer perhaps my comments are a bit strong but find it harder to navigate personally enjoyed the feature were I could plan and book flights months ahead that feature seems to now have gone amongst other simple to use navigation features
2023,5,I'm very liked this app. Fast and reliable prices. Easy Front-end interface
2021,2,"Used to be great. Now very glitchy and when you click on ""see all #_"" flights, the screen goes black. Just installed the Wego flights app- small size, quick. At least 4 now, much better than Skyscanner."
2019,3,"Lots of installation issues with this app lately. It'll download and never install, not begin the download, etc. Always takes several tries. No problem with all my other apps. Have now flushed cache, Force Stopped Play Store, rebooted, seven attempts and cannot install. This is the third update in a row I've had this problem."
2018,3,easy to use but excludes Southwest completely. i checked filters and does not even have them as option. I agree you can find great prices for all other airlines but I hate it excludes Southwest like most other travel apps
2021,3,"App is good, There are glitches though, I would have given 4 stars if it were some other app, but have high expectations from Skyscanner. off late I've realized fares are not real time. They tend to change when you are on the final booking page"
2022,1,"Fares are fake. Bogus app. One you try to book the tickets, fare will be 3-4 times higher than initially shown. Partner websites like goibibo just collect your personal info like mob, email and land you in payment page where you will be shoked to see final price of the ticket. Once you cancell everything and return to home page, same game starys again. Disgusting!"
2021,1,"No idea what happened to this app. Must have been some kind of sell out, maybe due to covid. Went from being the most extensive search engine to an unusable mess not even providing basic functionality."
2018,4,I didn't scored any great deal for my destination yet but I find the app super helpful and easy to navigate.. I'm also not sure how to change the currency to my preference..
2023,3,horrible search settings. Explain to me how I can select one airport and say all the direct flights from here you can't.
2019,5,"Very easy apparently to use to find the best priced flights. The filters and sort options make it very easy to use. the only improvement would be if the filters could recognise flights that cross over midnight. These results are included in the ""arrive before"" time because the end up in the early AM but that isn't what I'm after."
2023,4,pretty much smooth apart from offering full package deals
2022,4,skyscanner is a decent tool for finding cheaper flights. the from x to everywhere feature is cool when you just want to find a cheap ticket from a place but dont know where to go. sometimes tge calendar prices are wrong but ive seen this with all travel sites occasionally.
2022,3,"In general the app is good. Thougg recently it has been showing false prices when making the search for the flights. Eg, when choosing dates it shows you what the price will be when you click dates, and tells you the what the starting price will be for those dates. Though recently the lowest price does not exist once you enter search. It cheapest price will be well over what was said in the search results. Very confusing and annoying when you are trying to find dates and prices to match up."
2018,1,"It used to have great feature where u could find the cheapest flights on any particular date arranged by price, now it just shows the places in alphabetical order and there is no easy way to sort the flights by price. Its terrible!"
2023,1,"Really hard to work out why, when I search for days in October, it gives me dates in the next two weeks!"
2020,1,"What have you done??? Doesn't remember previous searches, determined via your phone location vs where you want to fly. No idea where to find business class option. Each time you update you fall further behind the competition."
2019,1,when redirected to book a flight at the Porter and Expedia sites the price had changed and was still not reflected on Skyscanner hours later. How long does it take for price changes to show up in Skyscanner? It's not worth using this app unless the prices are in real-time!
2022,2,"Have been using site for about 10 years, but now when I search in the calendar the price will be example $290 then you click on the day and suddenly comes back with the cheapest $390. That's a 34% increase increase."
2020,2,"Once selected any partner to book, the App goes unresponsive. Had to try multiple times to complete any transactions. Can you please check? I have given feedback inside the app, but not sure if any has looked into it."
2023,5,Fantastic app to help you stay updated on the best travel deals. I highly recommend it!
2019,1,"Normally i can see the price for all month, then i will decide which day i will love to travel and get better price.. But now its just same as other apps. Only price on the choosen date.. It make me waste alot of time.. Please do something"
2023,5,very good app for all travel booking
2023,1,Very poor experience (getting this ad on my feed continuous and now it got installed again uninstalling )
2018,1,"No good at all, it doesn't allow you to select the entire month or flexible dates, why then this app is useful now? Better just go to the web. And don't forget to compare in other places too ;)"
2023,3,good routes suggested with price bands
2021,2,"I Impressed about the recent negative reviews. Did you do any per-launch research before changing the app? Lucky you had good reviews before, otherwise you be at the bottom of app rating. How do I search for: next month, return trip Barcelona - las Palmas, cheapest flight, flexible duration, flexible dates? Is this not what the app is for? I'll change my rating if the solution is given. I FOUND IT: AFTER GOOGLING, Explore. Why don't you rename EXPLOPRE to FLEXIBLE. 1 star added for now"
2023,5,good for use and worldwide search engine
2020,1,Used skyscanner for years. But the new updates are so disturbing and have messed everything up. The new flights layout is so boring and the whole month fare option disappeared. Extremely disappointed.
2021,1,"It was a great app, but after a last update the search is a nightmare, and if a city has multiple airports, you can't search them all, have to do a separate search for every airport"
2019,3,"Giving 3 star bcoz of limited acess. Best app for searching flight just need some more information and acess like, meal selecting, seat selection, mail id filling option to send ticket on mail instead of automatically taking mail ID of someone else. Plz do improvements like xiago have many options."
2021,5,"Best travel app out there. Can't think of any other app that has a ""anywhere, anytime"" option. Scours every nook and cranny for the best deals. I rave about Skyscanner to anyone planning a trip."
2023,1,While I am booking my tickets it is showing booking for particular passanger.. I am not able to select more than 1 passanger. Although I have added 4 passangers but the app is asking you can select only 1 person at a time. #skyscanner Kindly resolve this. Awaiting for the reply.
2023,3,"It's decent, but why not allow direct flights only when searching for everywhere?"
2021,3,One major fault is the inability to search for direct flights. There should be a filter for that at the start before you enter a date. Otherwise you have to try dozens of date combinations to see if there are direct flights available.
2018,5,"At first site it seems like it's the same as all the other travel booking services. But this app somehow guides you to the best fares at good times of the day. Just be careful of budget fares with no baggage. For me that is not a problem, but for some it may be."
2019,5,i used 3 or 4 more apps at the same time... but this app proved to be a genuine and credible one.. it showed the best available rates of my desired flight at that particular time.. one other app(dnt want to disclose the name) showed flat Rs. 1000 off but at the end it was more or less same rate which Skyscanner is already showing.. so go for it guys...
2022,1,The only way the prices actually match are if you travel without any luggages. As soon as you add a luggage on the company website the prices go up at least by 6x. Total waste of time and just a price dangling marketing scheme.
2021,2,Thats how my rating started some years ago: 'UX is a mess...'. Instead of getting better its getting worse. Provide a clear input page and no wizard style input data collecting approach which make one crazy.
2019,1,You get one price in the search but when you click on the site to book you get a completely different price. This has been an issue for years. I'm not sure how anyone could be giving positive feedback when there is such a huge issue with this
2019,5,This app is perfect to use to search for competitive flights all in one place. Not sure if it suggests different dates with cheaper prices but if it doesn't it would be great if it did
2019,5,"Best app for searching flights for two reasons. The first, they have a huge selection of airlines. The second, they show you what days are cheaper to fly on. I recommend this app for sure!"
2019,5,I've used the app over the years and have always come back. I especially like the ability to receive automatic pricing updates to see how my upcoming trip is changing before I buy.
2021,2,This app used to be the best but they've made it unnecessarily confusing to search for something as simple as a flight. The visual overhaul is not worth what it cost us.
2023,1,offer cheap option but totally different price when clicking on it. unusable app. uninstalled
2022,5,"Hello team , Last from 1 month when i m using sky sacnner app for bookinf flights .it shows the same price what you have searched before 1 or 2 days whether check in morning evening or late night .the prices not show fluctuate rates it will be constant . Earlier when use eveytime it shows the new fares up downs in prices automatically . I hope you will solve this prob ASAP. Regards Dhruv"
2023,5,Best site which provides multiple options and prices are always less then other sites. Highly recommended
2019,5,Best app for flights! I tried almost every app and this one is the most user friendly. Quick updates! With the follow/alert feature I was able to jump on a flight that dropped $100 over night. Will be using this app again in the future.
2019,1,"App won't allow me to search by country, only city, example I want to check cheap flights out of Scotland to Germany, I need to search from Glasgow... Then Aberdeen... Then Edinburgh.... To the countless cities in Germany..... Makes no sense at all!!!!!! Just another company kidding themselves on that they are wonderful when in reality they are rubbish. What will your development team do with the information?"
2022,1,"Skyscanner will give cheap offerings on flights, but if you book through this 3rd party you will be screwed if there are any cancelations. We have found this out through them and companies that skyscanner is associated with, such as Destina Holidays and others. If you are due a refund from a cancelled flight, skyscanner and their associated companies will not answer emails or phone calls and gladly ignore you. Book directly through the airline so that you can get a refund if it is due."
2021,3,"I used to use the app often as i am a regular traveller, since the change in the user interface I find it very difficult to use and tend to opt for the desktop version instead"
2021,1,"I booked my ticket after searching in skyscanner on 20 January 2021 and the website was bravofly. The flight has got cancelled and bravofly is not even answering my questions about refund. The problem here is that, from a facebook group named ""Bravofly not giving refund"" I understood that the website has been notorious for an year and skyscanner still included it in their suggestion list. So what is the credibility of the skyscanner search.Directly book from airline websites and be safe"
2023,5,Skyscanner is easy to use and navigate. It is now my go-to tool to check for flights. I've used many tools but I find Skyscanner to offer more flexibility and is super user friendly.
2023,2,I use to like your app a lot but now the prices advertised when you set the search to anywhere almost doubles once you actually click on it. Why can't you just put the real prices instead of false advertising for clicks?
2023,1,"I have used a lot Skyscanner in the past, I don't know what's happened to it but it's not helpful anymore, hight prices and just a few airlines showing, it is best now to check directly with the airline you are interested in."
2022,4,"Gives more options for one to make an easy decision and filters to reduce your time. The challenge is when trying to make multiple city trips,it doesn't seem to be working."
2022,1,The price shown on the app does not matches when we go to the sites for booking the flight. The difference is so bigger. And the data mis match is from most of the sites it gives option to book from.
2023,3,Stuck in Spanish now. It won't go back to English.
2023,5,"Absolutely love it, everything I have been looking for! Perfect for idecisive person like me üôÇ"
2023,5,It makes me save more money and I love it
2023,5,"Really cheapest price you get over here, happy with Skyscanner."
2023,5,"Legit, and many affordable flights you can choose on."
2018,5,Easy to use interface. Compares multiple airlines and airfare search engines. Prices found/shown are what you pay when directed to the external website. A handy app overall.
2022,5,Great app. Used it in Europe and great for one ways or return flights . With the multicity option I found that I couldn't chose the combination of flights that I wanted. Could be the same with other services though.
2020,1,"I hate the app since the last update, i tried to get used to it, but the user experience and the lack of features compared to the previous app plus the bad customer service when you face an issue made me uninstall this app. You made a bad business decision !"
2023,5,always show many accurate options.
2023,5,this is an amazing application I have ever seen. A good discount on every flight which we choose
2022,1,"Had a great opinion on Ixigo... But, it has become Worst app now... It doesn't have any proper customer care support... Very difficult to solve payment failure issue... It' s been almost 10 days for the payment failure... No one is there to resolve the issue... Neither ""phonepe"" is taking responsibility nor Ixigo..... Atleast got a chance to talk to phonepe customer support... They said money is strucked with Ixigo.... Now the point is whom to contact in Ixigo.."
2019,4,"Skyscanner has made vacation planning so much more fun and so much easier. I especially love searching from my location to ""everywhere"". Reason my review is not 5 star is that I would ask the Skyscanner team to improve is more flight availability in more countries 6 to 9 months out."
2019,5,"It awesome, fly happy people! - I am a Mom and I travel as a band of 3. I believe in travel, exploring the world and immersing ourselves in culture and new experiences and the explore feature in the app make getting there at a best rate possible."
2020,1,"Just downloaded it, and I'm already uninstalling. It doesn't have any good search functionality, nor are the prices any better than other travel apps. Definitely not worth your time."
2020,1,I have used this app for years and the price bar graph was the best because I could be flexible. I have started downloading other options. Just bring it back.
2023,5,"my respect to the program developers. relieved a lot of headaches. The only request is to include flights from Russia - do not get involved in politics. This is a plus for the Russian government (it‚Äôs harder for citizens to move), but for ordinary people it‚Äôs a minus."
2023,5,This really has opened up so many opportunities to get around at an affordable price. Can't wait to get something booked for all the family.
2023,5,best easiest app ever with cheap offers
2022,1,"Absolutely disappointed by Skyscanner for its affilation with ""My Trip"". It was literally trying to scam my wife. She bought two outgoing tickets from South Korea to Bangkok. We found better tickets on Skyscanner an hour later, so we reached out to My Ticket to see about cancelation. The CS said the cancelation fee was like 400 USD when the price of the tickets was 600 USD without even checking with the airline. There was actually no cancelation fee from the airline. Are you kidding me????"
2022,1,"Whole month search not possible. The best feature about Skyscanner is the whole month search. Since I have the app, when I want to search flights in a whole month on the website it forwards me to the app where this is not possible."
2021,3,These changes that are being frequently made in the app operation are taking you down. Ita confusing and problem creating. It was an amazing app to use and functional. Now you people are changing the operational use for a leyman and people have also started to delete the app because of the same.
2021,1,"Whenever i choose the entire month, I only see the flights for the first flight, not for the return flight, and then the one who designed the app needs to be fired it s one of the worst apps I have ever seen not convenient at all and you cant easily choose what you want either"
2020,1,"Since the last update, the app more often than not can't find any flights, despite the web browser version showing flights for the same date. It also lacks functionality over the web site."
2023,1,"Prices shown on results aren't actually available. Select dates in calendar, shows ""from ¬£260"", click search and cheapest option is actually ¬£478. Makes the app a hindrance."
2023,1,I book flight on sky scanner del to Srinagar suddenly flight was cancelled by spicejet but app didn't give me refund
2023,1,old version waa good to explore options
2019,2,"I love skyscanner on the web, but unfortunately the app doesn't share one of the most useful features of thr website - the ability to add nearby airports to your search. I find i skip the app and go straight to the website as I can usuaally find a better deal there."
2023,5,it's a very good app and very easy to use
2023,1,need filter for connecting flight through the gulf
2023,5,so beautiful so elegant just looking wow ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÄüòÑ
2023,1,not showing whole month prices on mobile site
2023,5,Great flights good deals very nice skyscanner
2023,5,great and easy to use
2023,4,It's good experience...but some web sites are something do you know yourself that's better for you...
2019,2,"Familiar formatting that's easy to navigate. Unfortunately, they only list fights offered by United and no other competitors to compare costs. Found fights elsewhere for far cheaper comparatively."
2022,1,"Cannot load flights . Error message reads ""Oops, something went wrong. There was an error loading your flights Please check...while we check our servers "" Over and over. Nowhere to get this resolved Aaaarrrggghhh One month later...same probl√®m. Deleting app again"
2022,1,Be very cautious of using this app they will give you cheap price but if youw I'll be redirected to there sister company I wouldn't be suprised at all they will ad extra costs like some fares and taxes its better to fly well know regional airlines direct from there websites. Been redirected to difrenet site and the proxe after the payment was higher. Dont say sorry becasue most of companies are working that way. P.s I been charged for my finale ticket ‚Ç¨88 ekstra and I paid for basic
2023,5,lovely But they can't give you the deals only they can share which app is giving best deals and discounts.
2023,5,"must have app for frequent traveller's, it does a good job to identify cheap tickets."
2023,5,very helpful apps for cheaper Air ticket
2019,2,"Lately the app has been completely useless as prices don't match up when clicking through to book a flight. If this is intentional on the part of the company, then it's purely fraudulent."
2022,1,Not recommended at all...especially if u chosse Alrehlat as trip provider...they provide wrong information on the ticket regarding allowed baggage...they were telling me that there's no allowed baggage but on the boarding desk i was told that i have 46 kg allowed....so disappointing...i will not deal with either Alrehlat or skyscanner again...there are so many better alternatives.
2021,2,"What's happened to this app? It used to be clear and easy to use. Now I find it totally confusing and rarely get the results I want. The month view of flight pricing seems to have been removed, for example."
2023,5,best application for flight booking
2020,1,"Diabolical. Almost made me miss my flight from Vietnam back to UK! No email correspondence, no check-in updates, no communication at all. Just takes your money, send you the ticket and the rest is your problem. UK customer service is good until you hang up. Will never use them again"
2019,1,"didn't explain clearly, maybe trap from app cos when I was booking flight from bkk-KKC(‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏ô) Ur app just show only date and month , Ur app didn't show year of booking, as the result, I miss the flight today and my booking is on next year. So, I think it just a little problem on U but I,m surly ur customer may leave ur like me."
2019,4,initial impressions are that the app looks great and has nice features. yet to cross check prices with other sources which is where this app fell short a few years ago
2021,5,"Updates of 2021 completely killed UI and UX. I cannot even find how to buy a ticket from another country, it always uses my current location. Update (14 Apr 21) Very nice, previous UI and usability are back Thanks a lot!"
2022,1,This was once my goto app to see flights. Seems to be more complicated now. I can not search for airport and nearby airports at the same time anymore. It has become less user friendly.
2020,1,Not very dependable. It provides several tickets varations but everything are fake. When you click which of other offer you will choose but the amount being displayed and the amount being given are very different!
2023,5,"i am happy with this app but sometimes application show little bit different prices on same flight, overall nice appüëç"
2023,1,Makes flights more expensive when you look up repeatedly. More so when I logged in. This is how you repay loyal customers?
2020,5,Best app I found for the cheapest rates. Also gives you all kinds of other options.It definitely consistently gives me the cheapest flight I saw a one-way ticket from Nashville to Cancun Mexico for $102. For example this last week
2018,5,"Does what it says and says what it does. Definitely one of the best apps out there for affordable flights, not so much the hotels but the flights are quite affordable. Awesome job and hat off to the app developers üëè"
2021,1,"Very bad experiance. The travel agencies with this app are so unprofessional and my flight got cancelled, I wasnt even informed it got cancelled until 3 days later. I didnt cancel my flight, the airline cancelled it but the travel agency still charged me money for the ""fair"" and for the date change like obviously the date has to be changed since the flight got cancelled so why am I getting charged? This is complete bs. Ive been buisness w/etihad last 20 years but no more. Selena charged me."
2023,5,Wonderful app as it gives me multiple flight üõ´ options at one place and consolidates multiple booking options. Also the option of price change alerts and save the trip allows me to come back and check my trips anytime.
2023,5,Great application and very useful
2019,3,what happened to this app. Used to be so good and in the last few months it's gone from 5 stars to 3. When u go to check deals and u click on a provider (mostly when u click the skysanner deal) it comes back saying that fare is no longer available. It does this more times than not and it sux because it just seems websites are saying the price is lower so that we do click on it only to be given the option to divert to their main site because the fare u wanted isn't actually available. Fix please
2023,5,Best tool for planning a trip
2023,1,Fares are 100% incorrect and factors less than actual fares.
2023,5,"Skyscanner is the travel app you can book flights, hotels and car rentals."
2023,5,I can recommend to my freind your website is the easiest and fastest.
2023,5,great app. saves you the time of calling around
2023,1,This is very bad app ... I hate this app .. Please avoid this app and their website too.. üëéüëé
2023,5,it shows all options.
2023,5,what a very awesome app. Sincerely you deserve far more than trillion star.
2023,5,Best budget trip app everü´∂
2023,5,Easy way for finding tickets bargains.
2023,5,Very Good App for multiple Options
2023,5,Best site to find suitable flights
2023,5,Good to have it. it is so simple to check.
2023,5,"This app is best and low price I used the app 2 years ,"
2023,5,Amazing app for Travelers..
2023,5,really helpful app for last minute travellers
2023,5,Great app can't fault it really right now
2023,5,I need updates alerts very helpfully this app to me
2019,4,"I love the PC version website and dont understand why there is no ""whole month"" option like on the website. This option is awesome and you should have it in the app as well, the app is incomplete without it."
2023,5,Excellent to find Hotels
2023,5,very nice website for tickets easy use
2023,3,price should be little bit low
2023,5,Great app for watching flight prices
2020,5,"Very useful for planning and travelling. I like the fact, that you can search by day and moth. Usefull filters can find direct flights and there's also search by country if you don't mind which city you flying to. Must have app for every traveller."
2022,1,Its went down the road most apps go. Which is to be intentionally broken and sketchy so people pay more and more. Its not about finding you the best and cheap flights anymore. Its a scammy app ownded by scumbag businessmen I cant look at a single flight. It refuses to load any.
2022,1,"Used to have accurate prices, now it seems as if Skyscanner is making up prices that look good and then when you want to buy the ticket it's another price. Extremely useless."
2022,4,"Like the app but don't like the currency default based on my profile Nationality / Territory. I live in Mexico but don't like the develper assumption that I want prices in MXN. I want to view flight prices in USD, EUR, GBP as well as MXN (which is the default). Thank you."
2019,1,"Be careful when using this app. some flights that are supposedly ""direct"" flights on their site and app are actually connecting flights by the same company. Which is only obvious when you are halfway though the booking process!!"
2019,5,I find it easy to find prices and like the multi-city feature. I also like the suggestions the app provides. I've yet to book a flight or hotel but I'm sure it's straightforward
2020,3,"Once great, now ok Before the app was awesome, with more simple and user-friendly interface, and full of data and forecasts. Now it feels beautiful but empty."
2021,1,"Hello! I want to use this medium to tell you guys about awful thing you guys did to me, I bought a flight from you guys at ‚Ç¨12, from Bari to Bergamo on early September and the plain will depart 4th November, I bought it early so that the cost of the flight can be cheaper, then gotten to the airport on departure date, they told me that I need to pay extra ‚Ç¨60.50, with a total of ‚Ç¨72.50 who does that? I was very angry deep inside me, with all due respect kindly explain & refund my money back.Thnks"
2023,1,Use to be amazing until covid ended I booked a flight to bangkok The price of the flight was in dollars which I thought nothink about Presumed it's an American company and that's how they priced it Done the conversion uk to dollars it was the same price as on the app The price was in Stirling but when I booked it the price was in dollars Paid by credit card A month later on my credit statement was a non sterling transaction for ¬£27 on top the price I accepted Won't use the app no more
2023,5,the best travel website I've ever found...trumps all. give it a try and see!
2023,5,Best price. The best app to get the cheapest price flight.
2023,5,Bloody great app to check price and flight schedule but unfortunately not all flight already here
2023,5,"good search engine but some unusual results, like airport changing with impossible time"
2023,4,Great App BUT..... Need to add filter for baggage allowance and student discounts
2023,5,"best app for finding cheap international flight tickets, super !!"
2023,2,Deals aren't as good as they used to be. Google flights is way better.
2023,3,I like Skyscanner ..always shortlists airlines depending on my need.
2023,5,"Great app with price alert, works the way any similar app should. Thumbs up"
2023,5,"it is good when compared to other apps, the tickets are very less"
2023,5,"Really easy to find and book flights, hotels etc."
2023,1,prices advertised are always different when it comes to checkout
2023,5,User friendly and best for all kind of travellers .
2023,5,very good to have such a beautiful app to cut your travel expenses
2023,1,"%99.9,,fly not available or price didn't match...fake. from uk"
2023,2,Cannot search by baggage allowance. Doesnt know Virgin Atlantic is part of Skyteam.
2023,2,"I won't use skyscanner anymore and will advice all my friends to don't use it , because I was robbed from one dealer when I rented car , around 1500 USD has been withdrawn from my credit card"
2023,5,nice to be able to put in 'everywhere' for your destination and see what pops up.
2023,1,keeps crashing its an absolute disgrace and so frustrating
2023,1,Skyscanner app and website is charging same price for infant as adult even though airlines are charging 1500 per person or so.
2023,5,I've been using this app for hotels and flights for years! Highly recommend!
2023,1,Ticket prices much Higher then others Apps üôÑ very disappointing.
2023,5,Amazing app for searching your travel hoteling and reservations.
2022,1,I bought a ticket from eDreams and they sent me an email after 24 hours *Check in is open for your trip* after this email I bought my second ticket from other company and booked my accommodation. But after 40 hours I found out that my first flight from eDreams is not confirmed and they offered refund but they ruined my whole trip cause I can not have first flight. Seems all their reviews are 1 out of 5 and they do it all the time by gettung thier traffic from skyscanner and they do nothing about
2019,2,The search feature is different compared to the website. Not able to search by whole month. Adding nearby airports or direct flights only is t as easy.
2021,2,"The new search interface is terrible. When I want to search for flights, it means I want to search for flights. STOP INCLUDING THE HOTELS AND CARS IN SEARCH RESULT. Now the app has to load twice just to search for all available flights that I want. It's so time-consuming and inefficient."
2019,1,"i tried to purchased tickets through this app, and when i was ready to pay for my tickets with Smartfare it said there was an error when trying to buy the tickets and that i had to call customer service, why would i call customer service? if i already know where,when and how i want to travel. Waste of time!!! never using this app again."
2019,5,Excellent. Easy to use. Great leads. Offers a panoramic view of the prices and options. Must have for frequent travellers. Request please make a pro version for Travel Agents.
2023,5,"SkyScanner is a travel search engine that helps people find the best deals on flights, hotels, and car rentals. The website is user-friendly, and the search results are accurate, making it a great tool for travelers who want to save money and time. One of the best features of SkyScanner is its ability to search for flights from multiple airlines and show the results in a clear and concise way. This allows travelers to compare prices and choose the best option for their budget and schedule."
2023,5,Most trusted app to search for copamperative air tickets.
2020,1,"I used to be a frequent user of this but since I was frauded by Aerobilet, one of your partners, I think that you are no longer a trust worthy site. I lost 2000 USD through a reservation done in your site in which I was redirected to Aerobilet. When I sent you emails to help me get my money back,you just keep regretting and giving useless tips!! I just want my money. I advise all users to book directly on airlines official sites or travel offices and not use these virtual sites you can't sue"
2018,5,"Great all in one app. Shows cheapest, best price, and fastest all at once. It's all in one app, unlike K*y*k, which makes you go to each individual website. I will only use this app to find my flights. Thanks"
2020,1,"Used to love that I could filter cheapest month and chose departure from any USA airport to our destination. Now that those features have been removed, the app has no value for me. Please bring them back!!!"
2022,2,"rented a car, went to pick it up and wasn't available, they tried to contact me but didn't have my number. I don't know where they got the number they used. I used this app before on a rental car and the place was way off site from the airport I used and the car was rather shotty."
2022,1,"Headline prices are nonsense, ok if you want a 70 hour journey with no food,no water, no checked bag and a seat on the wing. Add in some reasonable filters for times etc and you'll see the price double or treble. All these providers on Skyscanner are interested in is adding charges and adding charges. Don't book with anyone other than direct with the airline. Get you act together Skyscanner you are now a complete joke just facilitating the duplicity of the booking providers on your app."
2022,4,Everything is good but in explore section there you can get only a week return flight which is not really good it would be better if there is a option to choose long duration. I hope they will work to make it possible.
2022,1,What bad experience in first 2 mins ...... Even there is no options to search city name ...only 2-4 select City is there but if we want to check availablity for others City this app not showing key pad to type manually n search..... Weste of time.... please improve quality of services first .....
2020,3,"I was just told month view available by tapping the dates box? To clarify I was looking for the ""anytime in a particular (April) month / whole Month"" option as offered in the browser version? Thanks for your explanation I'd already seen the graph view didn't realise it was a replacement."
2023,5,very useful information üíûüíûüíûüíû
2021,4,"Skyscanner is great, but I recommend you not send customers to Holiday Autos. I bought car rental insurance with them for a Europcar rental in Puerto Escondido Mexico, and Europcar wanted an $11,000 USD deposit if I didn't buy insurance from them. Europcar didn't charge me but Holiday Autos did, so I'll dispute the charge when I get home. Skyscanner itself is awesome and never had any other problem."
2021,5,"Great App, smooth interface and multiple options to choose from with an unparalleled depth with the variety of vendors available to buy from. A truly one stop app to book my travel and stay"
2022,5,"Seems to find the best flight deals with better consistency of all the tracking apps/sites I have tried, and displays estimates for each location to the day from the date selection window, i.e. great ""transparency"" in navigation through booking"
2023,1,"Skyscanner's been showing very odd, expensive quotes in the last week or two. London-Valencia in late Oct is ¬£160 on EJ, while your 'best' quote is BA which is over ¬£500"
2023,1,"Worst app ,while I am doing tickets also it is not showing in my trip list so it is very difficult to know whether my ticket is confirmed or not,kindly develop ur app not trips,offer.unable to contact ur customer service.This app is not eligible for giving 1 rating also."
2023,5,Awesome.. Just incredible..i always save my money by scanning... I hope they dig more into dip and find less fares from different providers.. I am in love with this app
2023,2,Was a good App but every time where to ? or where from ? page is blank I and it won't allow me to type an entry. but no windows to put it . So useless now and have to try other apps. Tried uninstaller and reinstalling but still a problem.
2023,4,"Great app, just needs to be more accurate when I search one airport, results include nearby airports too."
2022,4,Very good app and works well. They need to add a filter to include luggage. The number of flights from the UK to USA/Canada that are hand luggage only make searching quite tedious.
2021,2,"The app has really spiked downward. When you try to book a superlong flight from the with multiple stopovers, the flights will not be shown in the proper order. This app has become somewhat useless for me. I used to love this app."
2023,5,Best app for travelers. You will get everything at one place. Especially for booking of flights it's wonderful.
2021,5,"If your search is far enough out, the pricing is pretty good. I highly recommend this application. Before the pandemic, we got international flights for a family of four during the holidays for under $5,000. Considering the cost of travel during the that time of year, that's a deal."
2023,5,always a fantastic service
2022,2,"Selecting a multi trip, if I want to change a date and press back button, all information is lost, I then have to put all information in again. Why can I not just go back and change one date, just to see if the flight is available? Annoying, to day the least."
2019,1,I entered my flight info and waited 2 weeks. The flight cost fluctuated by a dollar or two and then it just started going up. I was able to get a cheaper flight on my own. I am now uninstalling.
2021,1,Absolutely dreadful experience....you couldn't design a worse user experience if you set out to do so. I gave up trying to find a flight. Will go elsewhere.
2019,1,the app and the site do not give the same information. I verified it for same days . there was a clear difference in price. the site gives better prices than app.. there is a serious flaw.. it was not a minor difference. 200 to 300 dollars for flight to Kuala Lumpur on Jul 2020 and return end of the month..
2023,5,I like that I have the opportunity to choose between different flights from different companies
2019,5,"I tell everyone about this app!! I travel all the time and this app is a must have. I saved a friend money by telling them about this app, they had purchased round trip tickets for $800 and I found them for $350 for better flight times and airlines, that's $450 savings!!"
2021,1,"It use to be great but now it is so bad. I search for flights and get results for hotels. I use to put price alerts on but now they seem difficult to find. Really bad, whatever has happened."
2023,1,"Do not use this app, the prices they quote are not the prices you'll pay. They use third and fourth party companies and you will be passed around from pillar to post, all blaming eachother for the significant higher price you'll pay on the day. It is all a scam and I am speaking from experience. It's completely dishonest, and this is especially true when booking a rental car through them."
2023,2,"Compared to other apps very minimal options, no search history, no way to track flights, lack of information on the flights. You're better off using the website and opening a bunch of tabs."
2020,4,"The app seems working OK now, but I still missing the features from the website version: not possible to search for whole month or for best month. Additional request: for long flights and when I have time I like to fly with long stopover. Can you please add a feature to show the flights with longer stopover at first?"
2019,4,app is good. but there should be an option to select the enitire month range instead of particular dates. the entire month range option is present in the website but not in this app.
2022,5,"It's my go to app to book flights. And has been for a few years. It's very accurate. Although, when trying to look for a destination sometimes the tool ""cheapest destination"" is sometimes way below the realities."
2019,5,"I don't even try to plan a trip, without help from Skyscanner: the data provided is accurate, up to date at lowest prices available. Lately, I rented a car at 40% less than all other applications offered. This is the best flight and car rental low prices provider."
2023,1,This is the worst booking platform I have ever gone though I am stucked in a city I was booking a flight for bengaluru from. Indore at the time of booking the price fluctuated. So instead of taking the difference amount they are asking for doing full payment again. üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ And not even refunded my previous amount. I am stucked now tomorrow I have to attend a meeting and I don't have enough funds to book it again üòñüòñüòñüòñüòñüòñüòñ Worst application don't use it
2022,1,"They Run a Scam Business and make money by permitting all fake Travel Agents. When you will opt for booking flights you will get to see number of travel agents offering different prices, you select one amongst them generally you go for the lowest, later you realise that it was a scam. No such flight ever existed whereas this people will inform you that airlines have cancelled the flight and you won't get a refund however, airlines have never scheduled the flight you've booked. HappyFares experi"
2019,1,Only having email notifications DAILY is ANNOYING! Can't use this app anymore until there's an option for push notifications AND an option to choose the frequency of notifications for watched trips.
2020,1,They use bad travel agents. Booked a flight with Travel2be through Skyscanner and their customer services are shocking. Would not answer phones and took over 6 weeks to answer an email. I'll never use skyscanner again. Don't trust them or travel2be
2023,1,Utterly useless. Every destination I search for never gives direct flights. Take for instance today's search. Glasgow to Derry Skyscanner shows flight from Glasgow to London them London to Derry. When Loganair offers direct flights from Glasgow to Derry. I was once looking for flights from Glasgow to Shetland Islands. Skyscanner suggested flying from Glasgow to London. London to Edinburgh. Then Edinburgh to Shetland. Really....... Skyscanner app will now be deleted.
2019,4,I used to love skyscanner but recently when I try searching for flights it keeps saying no flights found. Like no flights anywhere... Clearly there are flights happening somewhere so this is definitely a glitch rendering the app useless.
2018,2,"The new layout on the mobile app is terrible. Very unintuitive. I always use the desktop version, which is great."
2023,1,My experience is not good with this app. Somedays ago I purchased round trip ticket through this app via cleartrip. Return ticket cancelled by the flight company without any information. That's the ticket with this app doesn't confirm your journey. This is a trap only to exploit passengers.
2022,2,"Unfortunately paying for a ticket doesn't mean there are flights. I have used skyscanner for many years and Unfortunately used them for flights from Laos. I used a company which uses many names such as google, au.mytrip (they are not situated in Australia and are known to consumer affairs) and also mytrip. They don't honour there tickets or refund, I was told to wait for 60 days for a refund and when the time had elapsed they had closed my account. Skyscanner no accountability"
2019,3,"I found a great price for the tickets I was looking for, but the vendor offering them Sky-Tours is a scam. I could never get a confirmation and after some research found that others had some real nightmares when they actually did get tickets. So, maybe another vendor might do better, steer clear of Sky-Tours."
2019,1,The app is crashing on my Blackberry Android and it has recently started. It was fine until last few weeks. Please sort this out. The same app is working fine on my iphone.
2020,1,"App was much easier to search for flights. Now it's default to one way flight search, difficult to navigate to two way / return flight search. It was so much better before for flight search."
2023,1,"I had a very uncomfortable experience booking an international flight on Skyscanner. First of all, I wasn't aware that I had to choose a provider to book the flight. Then, after booking and paying with my credit card, I didn't get an email confirmation. It made me feel very uncomfortable and afraid that I got scammed."
2020,2,Why change what was a good feature? Before you could search on explore by date and it would show you actual prices or a diagram of prices for each flight... Disappointed
2019,2,Bad UX and hit one nasty bug that caused it to offer me incorrect dates. Clicking on the calendar view that shows the price ranges doesn't work properly.
2022,5,"Good easy to use App. To improve, Give details, in case of International travel. 1) when changing flights at 1 or 2 stop flight, whether to change airport / Terminals OR not ?? 2) when self check in , How much time required approximately to do re check in at stopover."
2019,3,The problem is often the headline figure given is that of travel agents without much of a reputation then if you look on airline website or reputable travel agency its much more. Should be able to select which agencies it scans.
2018,3,It looks for flights but doesnt give you the option to search everywhere which is what I mainly use... or to browse the cheapest month like it does on the website. Would really use this app alot more if you updated these few points.
2019,1,You people completely cheat people. Shame on you.. i was trying to book flight and and last moment i see that its only hand baggage fare. While in the other website same price was mentioned without handbag fare.. And atlast it was written in small words 0kg check in bag. So what will happen if it booked without noticing . Shame on you once again
2020,1,"Not the best app anymore. Doesn't show you all flights and not the direct and cheapest flights. Can unexpectedly change your search date a month into the future, making it possible for you to book the wrong date."
2021,1,I had a very bad experience.I had booked a flight from Delhi to Bangalore from Skyscanner which was preponed and the airline executive said to me you will get refund from their side to the Skyscanner. But i tried many times to contact to Skyscanner team but unable. They are fraud. I genuinely suggesting to the coustmers please don't fall in the trap of cheap flights because if your flight has been cancelled or any this type situation they'll never refund back even you don't chance to contact.
2021,1,"Please be aware when you buy tickets from them not to be sent to an other company called OOJO. They are scammers. I purchase through them the tickets and also Travel Care Service and they don t respond.They take my calls and say they will call me back. 3 times already and they don do it. No manager available, just very untrainned personel that they only know to write your name and flight confirmation number"
2020,1,What's happened??? Been a skyscanner user for years and this new layout is terrible. No cheapest month option and harder on the eyes not having a list format. Please bring back the old skyscanner
2021,2,"Twice I have looked up flights saw a great deal cane back to see it almost double, but when I use the site without the app the same is showing the original price. Cookie policy is false!"
2019,5,"Of all the apps that deal with flight searches, this one is one of my favourites! The main function that I really enjoy is that you can choose your origin and then compare the prices to a variety of destinations without going back and forth"
2019,5,"I must say, i have found 92% of searching for flights on Skyscanner the prices are cheaper then airliners themselves. very good app in my view and I give credit where it is due.highly recommended to the people who fly alot."
2022,1,"Not good , always price lower on search page, but on time of booking fare jumped. And fare will hike. Better to prefer with Professional Travel agent for hassle-free trip always."
2022,1,"I don't like it. When you're looking for a flight and you press to go to the reservation page, you find another price that doesn't look like the price given in the app. Fake app. not even 1 star"
2023,5,I've used Skyscanner over the last couple of years for travel and by far the cheapest website i've ever come across. I was able to search over the whole month and mulitple airports etc. Whats up with this upgrade? User friendly versus ????
2023,5,SkyScanner is not just an App its an Travellers Habbit to chedk frequent Flight Priceses for around the world here.. Though this app have few glitch as well where many times its show the lowest price on the main page but while go to next page the price shows completely different & expensive. So i think the makers should focus on this & try to resolve this genuine issue. Rest i will give 9/10 review
2021,1,"I do not recommend that buy tickets from the Mytrip company, they have a very bad service, I bought a ticket and wanted to change the flight dates, called them several times, even there was such a time that I had an hour to wait but still did not answer, and even I don't have my ticket numbers. and now even I can't return my money."
2021,5,"Use Skyscanner all the time, easy to use with a simple interface, accurate pricing and easy bookings. Never had any problems, up to 30+ flights a year, regardless of ticket provider. Great App."
2019,1,had this app for years and never had a problem with it.... since last update I cannot search for flights anymore.... general search still works but once I click on the specific date it shows no connection.... well I have a connection since I am writing this review right now.... fix it or revert to previous version
2019,1,"I only used this app for the widgets, but they have been removed since the update. Would be great if widgets were returned as it was definitely the stand out feature for this app."
2020,1,"The last update has ruined the app, I was able to search flights from one destination to anywhere for example. It just looks awful now. Why do you have to change something that works? I don't understand."
2018,3,"Skyscanner is helpful. But often, you don't get the same prices on your PC and on your phone. It's worth to compare the prices on different devices."
2018,4,Easy to use and I've found good deals using it. I've occasionally found better deals using other searches but the consistency with skyscanner had been good.
2021,1,"They have listed agent BudgetTickets which is cheater. On search page it shows the cheapest fare and when you try to book on their site, fare increases substantially. Due to this all fares are shown incorrectly on search page."
2020,5,The 5 stars are not awarded only for the operation of the app but mostly for the Customer Care Support. I am currently facing problems with my Travel Agents Bravofly for refunding the tickets of cancelled flights and ONLY Skyscanner Customer Support is chasing the issue and not Bravofly. Their help is much appreciated. It's important also for Skyscanner to clear out the Travel Agents who don't comply to basic rules of Customer Care as Bravofly does.
2021,2,Do not install this app. My credit card was charged but was told I was a victim of fraud and there was no ticket when I called because I didn't receive booking confirmation.I was told that I was scammed and to contact my credit card company.the agent also said she had other phone calls about Skyscanner transactions being victimized.Skyscammer is'in Scotland which makes it difficult to hold them accountable
2022,1,"Very disappointed üò° I booked my flight ticket with Akbar travel through Skyscanner at cost of ‚Çπ31,000. After successful payment i did not received any email confirmation from Akbar travel. And then after few minutes they sending me email to pay extraüò° Skyscanner shows all fraud ticket rates and after payment nobody interfere in customer issues."
2019,2,I downloaded this app specifically because they claimed to support price alerts for multi-city flights. However I can only find an option to monitor prices for a specific flight.
2021,1,"The updated version is awful. I used to enjoy browsing for vacation ideas, but not anymore. User's experience has degraded a lot to me üëé"
2022,2,"Skyscanner is great, however the app won't let me search ""everywhere & direct only"" like the website does. I have to search everywhere then iterate through every result to then find the lowest direct price"
2019,4,"Initial experience is very confusing. I was not looking for a ""travel agency"", but that's how the app presents itself. I want a flight search engine, and that's all,"
2022,1,Pathetic experience. I have done the booking through the Skyscanner. Not user friendly as not clearly showing baggage Information. Confusing! had to pay service fees due to their horrible platform!!!
2021,1,Very disappointed... If there is a difference in the booking amount from what you have paid... Forget refund customer service won't even care to respond.. I understand the issue is with the service and the app.. hoping this will help others
2022,1,"Booked flights directly though the app, got my conformation through email but the app doesn't show my booking in ""my trips"" and won't let me even search for my booking or get help in finding the details."
2021,1,This app is fraud they took my money and i didn't get my ticket or any confirmation and when i tried to contact them they did not assist and i kept making international calls which costed more than the ticket not recommended at all regarding your reply i already contacted them yesterday but they did not help i would rate you zero if possible
2020,1,Before that i was able to select departure and arrival destination but now its gone and everytime it shows me the opposite of what i searched for. So pathetic and angry as i loved this app before but now i have to go for other option.
2019,4,It's a good app. Occasionally marred by slow updates of the flight availability. Have not tried other functions other than the flight purchases.
2021,3,"I don't know if it's the quality of aggregators got worse, everybody are hacking the prices, i.e. I see one price on Skyscanner, then another after I selected then flight, and the the final once I redirected. Shameless growth hacking"
2018,1,"I had worst experience with skyscanner. I searched ticket on skyscanner, I found deal on 1 ticket on trip air. I booked it and after payment.message came payment fail. I contacted trip air and they were saying they didnt get payment. I shown them my bank statement which clearly show that my paymnet is transferred to their account.Still they are not accepting it. I searched about trip air on Google and it has vary bad rewies regarding bookings and scam. My complain to Skyscanner is why they show such a fraud site in their search. Is skyscanner also involved in such fraud schemes?"
2019,3,"Great app. have been using it for years. But for the last year I haven't been able to get the widget to work on my phone or my tablet. Have tried everything, even reformatting both my phone and my tablet."
2021,1,The new app format is extremely user unfriendly and I can't navigate it like I used to in the old version. I am switching to another app until Skyscanner fixes this new version
2018,4,"Good app but I'd literally only just discovered the home screen widget and then the very next day it's gone! Please bring it back, it was great and because it was on my homescreen it made me a lot more likely to open the app."
2019,5,"awesome deals and it shows all the options you would need to consider. I have used so many apps to find the best flight deals, and this one is definitely one of the most comprehensive."
2018,5,Best app for searching flights...Astonished about the speed of search and comparable prices which were so true...Thanks a lot for developing such an useful app for smartphones..Now I can check my air fares at the tip of my fingers...waiting for exciting updates..
2021,1,Used to be a fantastic app. Now the interface is so not user friendly and no flights? The ticket algorithm not working? Quite disappointing. I'll be waiting till its former glory is restored.
2022,1,It was great app but from last many Days its app and website is not working. Website is totally not loading while app does not search any flight. And unable to search name of city. Issue checked for airtel user.
2023,2,Top Deals Pop Up Annoying App is going downhill with the latest update. Every time I set dates it shows an annoying pop up with good deals on different dates and I have to exit it out. It's confusing and unhelpful.
2018,5,I've used this app many times to book flights. I think it does a good job at comparing prices of airlines and it also send you updayes so you know if the prices have went up or down.
2020,1,"The new version is terrible, making a simple search became so complicated! It seems like no one had tried to use it before you uploaded it."
2023,1,"Last year this app was great, but now trying to search for flights is a nightmare. All I want to do is search for direct flights but everything I go back it resets it all didn't do this last year."
2021,1,"This App was fantastic ,It was our Go To App for last 10 years. Latest version has turned it into Rubbish ! Complicated ,Hangs abd Useless. Sad Developers ruin another Great App."
2020,1,"You've ruined a perfectly good app. Unable to change departure airport, uses GPS to predict or something I guess. Either way, it's now useless. Uninstalled"
2018,4,Good app to find flight and hotel options. But sometimes prices vary on checkout. And few listed options are not online booking friendly.
2018,5,Been using this app for 2 plus years to find great last minute flights across the US. Love it. Wouldn't book a flight without checking their rates first.‚ù§
2021,5,love this app. helps me get great deals on flights. went to Paris new years of 2019 for $375 rt from NY!! yes we had to connect a couple times but for that price it was worth it.
2022,1,"Lost all my money and flights cancelled 3 weeks away from my trip two weeks of calls to chase my cancelled flights with no response, this happened from Skyscanner.. The agent Mytrip, who I was referred to via Skyscanner has ended me up in this rediculous situation, the wortlst customer service I have ever experienced. Horrible experience NEVER AGAIN.. BEWARE YOU'LL LOSE YOUR MONEY"
2020,1,Mistakely i had booked wrong date un the same time i contacted budgetair but the refused my request unless i pay administration charge and i had contacted skyscanner before regarding that issue aswell but till now no solution now As per Emirates i got the chance that i can change the time for my flight before 31 mar but the are not even reply my emails or voice call .even the link you have sent doesn't work Kindly assist
2020,1,New interface that ASSuMEs that you want to find flights from your local airport is frustrating. There seems no easy way to type in a departing airport. Why make it so hard?
2019,5,"Thus far all my international flight arrangements made with Skyscanner (14 so far) turned out to be superb, accurate, and best deals in comparison to other like apps. This is the app I vouch for based on my very positive experiences."
2020,5,"The best traveling agency and responsible agents on internet with this app you will have the lowest flight faires , honest and fair flight booking all year round. This is an app which is offering a great service and be an example of remarkable service as far as price and traveling comfort. You should be proud of your app and business,well done guys."
2019,5,Downloaded the app for the first time. Selected my filters and also notification for price drops. So far app has done its job by notifying me on a price drop. Will continue posting with results after ticket purchase.
2020,2,I tried to make a flight reservation through ur app which diverted me to @cleartrip.. once the money was deducted i got an email which says payment unsuccessful and the money will be refunded to my card in 12 working days but till now no money was refunded.. no emails was sent.. and they dont have a clear email to contact them
2020,1,Terribly awful layout... used to be very easy to use. What have you done Skyscanner? Who signed this new layout off?... did you honestly think this was an improvement for finding flights?
2019,1,The prices for flights that you can actually book are always around 200‚Ç¨ higher than the prices advertised. Doesn't help you with finding the right prices at all.
2023,1,"I select a ticket yesterday at 10:15 pm, where website prices on $ AUD and I proceed to buy it. When I saw my bank account the price had been charge on $USD, therefore, I paid $ AUD 200 extra. Ticket was bought with Avianca airline. I'm so disappointed with that."
2022,4,I Like this app. It is very easy to use and handy. It would be great to see the app evolving to show what days are more expensive/chep in the calendar.
2019,5,"The best app ever,ü§© to find inexpensive flight deals, & U really do get the best deals. I have searched most of the websites to find specials, but Skyscanner only gets the best deals 4 U.üôå Thank you Skyscanner, I just love your app.‚ù§üíØ"
2022,1,Absolute garbage. I downloaded this as it's a neat app rather than the web based Google Flights. I ran them side by side and this app didn't find the much cheaper options using Google Flights. Uninstalling.
2019,1,Where is the flexibility to search? every single app can search from exact airport on exact date. what makes an app great is when they allow you to search with flexibility of dates and airports. this is missing here making this basically useless.
2022,1,"I have yet to get a price shown on this middleman site, Skyscanner. More realism needed. Be super careful of their 'partners' - reviews of nearly all of them are appalling."
2020,3,It's a good app for price comparison but I definitely stores data and increases prices if it recognises you've already looked for flights. Make sure you clear the cache regularly
2018,5,Why it is a very good in case to find cheap flights and good hotels but it to have some short comes and that can be shot out with some help of the the people that are using it if they will come and their problem that might be like solved out.
2019,5,"Extremely helpful, easy to use, highly recommend! I've never had any issues with it and have booked several cut price flights using it."
2020,4,I love this app but willing to give 5 star if you extend the search period for explore. I was using an iPhone before and Skyscanner apps allows me to search and explore up to more than 6 months.
2022,4,I have found some great deals over the years hence the twin reason I continue to use it however alot of times the prices shown to do not match up when you actually click on it to purchase!
2022,5,"Quick getaways, etc. One section is gone There used to be 4 sections on bottom bar. Now there's only 3 sections. Explore - Trips - Profile. There used to be one more section that had useful features."
2021,1,"I don't know why my earlier comment was deleted!!! Everytime this app gets a new update it gets way more complicated to be used. I am totally considering now to find an alternative app. Edit: you are still asking about what annoys me? I said it clearly, the app is now very difficult to use and I can't find flights as simple as I used."
2019,4,Would give 5 stars if the pricing shown in the calendar picker always matched the price in the search results. Sometimes it's a bit off unfortunately.
2019,5,I was so happy to get a wonderful rate as I was about to go crazy as how astronomically high rates were. I also love how it compares to all travel engines and how easy it is to go from here into the flights. so far satisfied
2022,5,best app ever ! üòç this is the first time I use the app to choose & book a flight ticket . it was very easy & the best thing is you can see the price for each day. I hope you all can enjoy using it üòâ
2019,1,budget air has rendered this search engine useless. literally every single flight i search for is undercut by budget air and it always turn out to be a misleading add!
2019,3,"There is a bug in Android mobiles. After clicking on See more flight deals, the scroll doesn't work. It doesn't display all the trips and prices for 3 months."
2019,3,"I love the web version. The app isn't great though. Really slow, doesn't allow you to see exact prices on the map, etc."
2019,1,it became very inconvenient after the update when I search flights. you guys can add an option to select between new interface and old one.
2022,1,"Really annoying to have the week start at Sunday in a date picker for a world-wide app, where I have UK/GBP (or any EU country) selected. It just makes planning a huge headache, my head literally hurts from my eye jumping between weeks to figure out when I could go."
2019,5,Almost perfect. An improvement would be the possibility to choose a week or a specific number of days in the search of flights and in the alarm of price variations.
2021,1,"Older version were better. New design, smaller data base. If you type the airport short name like LHR, GTw, the app does know what you talk about. Previously you could check lower prices on a calendar. Search engine is wors and makes you lookon othe websites then this app. I will probably uninstall it as not much in use"
2019,5,"Wonderful experience everytime. It has made our travel planning so easy, and yet always suggesting the most economical options. Keep-it-up."
2020,1,"It was very good till this last update. All the options to search have gone haywire. Somehow it feels like its using big data quite openly right now, kinds of invades privacy."
2019,5,"Best app, i have used this app to book every flight the last year. Such a intuitive platform and really makes things easier for me when i travel abroad."
2019,2,"am i missing something? very unfriendly UI wont register any trips no alert modes, no nearby airports, no map? how does this have a decent rating."
2020,1,"Most worse app On 2nd of march 20 I have tried to book my flights for 5 people through skyscanner and its takes me to one of its partner Gotogate they never issued me any tickets and hold my money for 9 days, I think its might be issue of technical problem But when I tried it again on 10th March exactly same thing happened again Then I will pretty shore that they don't want to sell the tickets on the price which they adver, the skyscanner is actually deceiving by flash cheap tickets"
2021,1,Since the upgrade the app is not very handy to use. Choosing flights from different locations is becoming challenging. Started to use other apps instead.
2019,5,"great app easy to use .. only downside is the price quoted isnt nessecarily the price you pay, when directed to the actual page can be a bit more,having said that i use skyscanner all the time for alerts to price change etc..."
2018,5,Great app being able to choose each flights times when trying to book a round trip would be nice but maybe that's why it's a bit cheaper than other sites/apps.
2019,1,"I love it how Skyscanner personnel ""were not aware"" of unauthorised user data transmissions to Facebook. Perhaps the latter hacked their systems? Of course, we shall never hear an admission of guilt, but who needs it when it's so blatantly obvious. Uninstalled."
2018,5,This all is great for being able to see a broad range of pricing in a single view. It single-handed saved my wife and I $700 on a recent trip. Highly recommended!!
2019,5,"My favorite sky service, been using it since it's inception. It took me some time to switch from the site to the app, but now I know how to display the month chart which is really helpful."
2019,4,"This service always finds me the cheapest flights, but I would like better search options because I often don't care when I fly, only when it's the cheapest. I find other services are better at this."
2023,3,"Pretty bad app for a great website, cannot find a way to setup alerts for flights or date, even IF it exists it is buried in some settings. Poor UI design."
2021,1,"The functionality is pretty limited. Even such a basic option as showing direct flights only isn't implemented in the app, that's why I'm back to using the website."
2021,1,"The previous version was better, also, the estimated prices are completely off, not even close to the actual prices which are at least 3 or 4 times over the estimated. Overall, bad experience."
2019,5,"Great experience! Easy to use. I like that the journey conditions are clearly explained e.g. overnight sleep, change of airport, additional costs on luggage."
2022,1,"It never shows the booking in its history. I booked 2 tickets, one got confirmed and another didn't get confirmed but money didnt get back. Now there is no help from their partners and themselves as well. Worst experience."
2020,1,Since this app has been updated. I realized when check your flight plan details. It doesnt show the airline full details. For example what type of plane. E.g A380 etc. Before the update it use to show the full details.
2019,4,"Very good app for finding and booking flights and hoels worldwide. It used to show a chart of prices for a month, which I could not find."
2019,1,"Hi Skyscanner, I actually booked a flight yesterday but, one thing I dont understand due to they dont send an email after I booked. I have not received any email, I'd checked my bank account then I found that it was already despensed. Please help me, and make time for this matter."
2020,1,It was such an amazing tool for finding flights. They changed it and now I find it useless. Such a shame they broke something that worked so well. Please give us our old version back.
2023,5,"Love this World's the ""Best App ...!!!"" By Using Some Special Tricks => From India => Booked ""South & East Asia's 18 Countries"" (including Australia, Japan, Sri Lanka & All other 15 Countries in this Triangle too ! Round Trip - 15 Aug to 31 Dec) 20 Flights Fare Only For Total INR 120k ...!!! Only Two Things required => 1. All Lowest Hidden Prices We have to find out date by date - Not Shown there in Green by the App - So plz Fix it ...!! & 2. Increase the Searching Speed - it's So Slow ...!!!"
2019,4,"They dont have all the airlines, but its a great way to find deals on flights with most airlines. Also great to find the cheapest place to go, if you're flexible, or looking for ideas"
2019,1,Stopped using this app about a year ago after it updated from useful and easy to cluttered and complicated. Thought I'd see how it's improved but it's clearly gone the other way. Terrible app
2022,5,"I'm a seasoned traveller, and have used Skyscanner for a Long time. If i have Skyscanner, and my passport, i travel. Asia mostly, but also Australia, New Zealand. It's a friend you need as a traveller."
2019,5,"provide cheaper prices than other apps and even price from the airline, so the prices it provided must be the cheapest. the cheapest price is from an agent but it didnt provide enough time for me to entry data. So, eventually, I bought tickets from the airline."
2023,4,"i love the everywhere feature for searches when I'm unsure where I want to travel. sometimes confusing to navigate (when trying to set an alert). some little search glitches. but, overall, I'm a fan"
2022,2,When I click on explore everywhere nothing happens. I didn't have this issue before. Hoped the latest update would fix it but nothing :/ reinstalling also didn't help. Does anyone know why this could be?
2019,1,I booked a flight through this app and when I got to the airport I did not have a ticket ready for me because the app never payed the airline. A lot of money was spent on a useless flight. No one should use this app. They are shady and will not take responsibility for their actions.
2019,2,"The app doesn't let you remove undesirable airlines (I.e Spirit and frontier) like the website. And currently as I write this, the website shows results from southwest but this app isn't. Sigh. I'll just stick with the website"
2019,4,Starts anytime while using your phone in fullscreen. It will change your browser settings. Persistent app even It was set to forced stop... It was only on startup after install.
2019,5,"I love this app because It shows without hesitation the lowest cost on your trip. Plus it uses 3 categorized colors, green low, yellow middle, and red high cost."
2021,5,my go-to flight booking app. usually has the best mix on average. not often I find cheaper elsewhere. I do find the direct flight filter problematic to find though
2021,1,"SkyScanner don't care about your money or your time. Don't expect professional work from them or from their providers company. I booked round trip tickets for 321$, then I had an email they confirmed the reservation. After that, they sent me an email and informed to that the first flight canceled for some issues. Then I sent to them 9 emails and I called them on cell phone but nobody answer to my emails or call. After one day, they sent me an email they will refund 40$ from 321$ for first flight"
2022,1,"Phoney Flights: keeps bringing up flights that don't exist at the times they say, or airlines that don't even go to the destinations you are searching. How can that be legal??!! Absolutely ridiculous. Always look up the airlines own site and you'll soon see."
2019,4,It would be worth 5 stars if I would be able to reset the calendar to start the week on Monday instead of Sunday. It's so darn annoying and confusing for weekend travelers.
2018,5,"Good Travel App. I use it to identify base costs for flights. Some flights will be more expensive when you add baggage, and booking seats together."
2021,4,I use this app all the time for cheap flights. I particularly like the 'to anywhere' function. Would be good to be able to see baggage allowance.
2019,1,"App is downright useless now compared to what it was in the past. And i only look for flights, not sure about other features. At least web wersion is still accesible."
2019,1,Latest update done it for me. No longer does it show you prices when you select anywhere you have to click on individual countries. Whom has thought about that silly thing? Ruined it for me.
2022,5,"The best app for booking flights, no complications at all simple and easy to use. And you get the flights in reasonable prices. And yeah no ads at all it's the best thing. üòáüçÄ"
2019,5,"Brilliant. I only wish the app allowed the ""include nearby airports"" as the website does. Also, any app including ads should have an option for users to pay & remove ads..."
2020,1,Very challenging to use after the changes. Difficult to navigate around the app. Hopefully it will be reversed.
2020,5,Easy to use and helps plan trips. Saves me a lot of money on my airfares - don't get ripped off by travel agents and airlines - download Skyscanner. Small improvememts could be made.to the App but that doesn't detract from its brilliance in finding cheap flights.
2022,2,"Filters don't work - anytime I update departure and arrival, the list of the flights showed don't change, which defeats the purpose of having filters altogether"
2020,5,"I love this app, I do not know why people are doing 1 star this app is my favorite app, there is nothing wrong with it! It finds that cheapest day to fly, the cheapest options the best options I really love this app, it also does hotels and car I 100% recommend this"
2023,5,The Best Place to Find Out the Best Airline and a Hotel Patner and Book a Ride for you as far HatsOff!!! üëèüëèüëèüëã and most imply is it the Price or the POINT Price that i can see Right there in the Photos IF YES !!! üòá then i would like to avail that PLEASE !!! üòá
2018,1,"Worst experience ever I had reserved one way flight through your application with trip.ae, I discover later that the reservation was done two ways try to complain to cancel reservation ,no one reply on mails no numbers for customer service to complain, try to contact with trip.ae to cancel reservation no reply, dont trust skyscanner or trip.ae in your reservation"
2022,2,"Ok. Im trying to block flights with Air Canada, or air china.(both absolute garbage) But flights keep showing up. maybe the option to lock filters would be great. Same with flight times, airports, etc"
2019,5,Easy to use. Intuitive. Helpful ( fly to one airport & return from a 2nd one from the same city for a better price or the search option by country rather than by city ) Cheers.
2022,5,I have book flight for my friend through skyscanner and the booking agent was trip.ae. Payment was made 4 days ago but e-ticket has not been issued yet. And the PNR provided with the booking is not available with the airline website . I contact already with the trip.ae but am not satisfied with their reply. Please reply PM for the details to resolve that issue asap. Thanks With best wishes
2020,1,I was just looking for a cheap flight to anywhere. This app does not do the trick. You have to check the price to every city. There is no sorting prices. No very useful.
2020,1,"I booked from this app and directed to a website called edreams. After filling up the info for the payment, an error occured then my bank account has been charged and there are no ways to contact the vendor to let them know about the problem. My bank ask me to coordinate with the vendor, tell me how the F can I do that!? Even the help page of this app is useless and directs to a webpage that is not available."
2020,1,"Newest update forces you to give them your data & track your usage to ""improve your experience"". Oh & by the way, third parties as well. Meaning they sell your data. ""Your data, your choice"" should be ""Our data, no choice"""
2019,1,"Very first time i booked my air ticket through skyscanner, which was diverted to TRIPAIR online booking site, my money laready deducted, and after almost 2 weeks of booking i received message from tripair that your booking have been canceled by airline, when enquired about my refund. They replied it will take 30 days, my concerns is this is not the mistake of customer than y it will take 30 days. Very very bad experience"
2023,2,"Webpage is MUCH better than your App. The Filters and Sort doesn't work at all, giving guest user only 3 flight options and when we select more . The page runs into Errors. Same case with filters option. Kindly improve"
2022,1,False Prices!! The price shown after the search doesn't match with the actual service providers/airlines. Used to be a good app earlier. NOT RECOMMENDED!
2021,2,updated and now it doesnt display price graph.. or price calendar. Bring that back. It sucks searching each day separately. When calendar price display
2021,1,The new update is so so so so so confusing and impractical to use. The old Design layout was smooth and easy. Horrible app now. Have uninstalled.
2021,1,"One of the online scammers Be aware of this app. I searched for a flight and booked, after booking I did search again for same flight and the price dropped by 25%... Be careful , I recommend never to use this app.."
2020,1,Not impressed by the recent update. The bar graph comparing prices is gone and the most recent format is less user friendly.
2020,1,"What a terrible UI choice! What's up with the new Flight Search design? Where To comes first, after From and Calendar with Dates sometimes come up and sometimes doesn't?! Somehow it predefined all my flights now start from Pula?!"
2020,5,Has been using Skyscanner for couple of years and love it. The app is missing some of website's functionalities though. The one I miss is checking the prices within a month.
2019,4,this time it worked I bought the ticket half price compare of the airways own page. good deal. thanks.but the alarm is not functioning. prices are doubled not even one single warning
2019,1,"If your goal is just to find cheap flights, the app is useless. It wants to plan hotels and stuff too for you, and has less funcionality than the website."
2018,1,"The app does not give the same option like the website like the cheapest month option , everytime I use it I had to switch to the website. Really useless."
2018,5,"Does exactly what is required of it: Exhaustive results, decent criteria filters, sends bookings to calendar. No issues so far!"
2019,4,"I have not tried the website so can't compare app and website, as some of the reviews do. But the app works wonderfully. No problem at all. Really helpful in planning the trips"
2020,2,"Without the graph üìä which shows you the cheapest days to fly, this app is just a like any other app and is average. If you bring back the old feature then it becomes 5 stars again."
2022,1,"the providers most of the time have not the same price as on skyscanner. it is very frustrating to see a price and after whem i get redirected to the provider like fo to gate, mytrip etc they have different prices...."
2023,1,"The worst version you ever had, full of bugs. You can't change the date and i am stuck with one date. It take ages to load the destinations, and does not apply location."
2023,1,"Very bad experience first time I booked through using this application, the ticket dealer denied to change name in e-ticket I have booked flight with air India from UK to India. Getaflight dealing omitted my middle in the ticket. I thought there will be a option to change in name or modify it even this application don't have any option do it."
2019,5,love it. have used it for 4 summer vacations now. discovered new airlines that changed my travel patterns and budget. i wish it had an optipn of booking premium seats.
2020,1,Don't like being forced to use the where to feature. I want to search multiple flights from/to multiple destinations easily.
2023,1,"Server ""dropped me off"" maybe because of VPN, yes it was the VPN I turned it off and it works but that's BS It should work with my VPN on, next it infinitely loads after searching. Seems not to be a functional app."
2019,5,"I was recommended this app in October 2019 and its the best app for finding your flights. I booked a weekend in Gran Canaria, yes, a weekend! Return flights for ¬£46.99! Advisable to book asap as prices do fluctuate daily but I'm addicted to Skyscanner. Happy Flying!"
2019,1,"rates for international flights are expensive compared to other search engines like kayak, price line etc. I never tried to use this app for domestic flights"
2021,1,The application is not working when I press the button on the flight that I want it keeps going to uploading mode without showing results .. + going to official website the prices is significantly higher than the app without showing the results I had on my phone app
2022,1,"I have a booked a flight ticket two times but both of them were canceled, now agoda is saying they don't have the booking from my number and I can't find any customer support of SKY scanner... Wrost experience......"
2021,1,"A disappointing experience: I booked a flight using skyscanner and it took me to the website of Rehlat. The money is deducted from my account but didn't receive the booking confirmation. It has been three days, i am chasing Rehlat but no response from them. Why Skyscanner is working with agents/broker who did not respond and deduct the money from customer account and who is responsible for it?"
2019,5,I haven't booked anything yet but its sooo helpful comparing all the 3rd parties websites to find the best deals! honestly really helpful to plan a spontaneous trip. or something planned.
2023,5,very very profitable app
2023,5,"Very good app, but some issues are there, how to get group fare,"
2020,1,It's amazing how bad this app is. Even the desktop site is rubbish now. Sucks cos Skyscanner has been my go-to for ages for flights but now it's completely useless. Why on earth it was even changed is a mystery. It's like New Coke. Unnecessary and bad.
2019,1,Worst app ever. Prices are changed every second and not because they really changed. The app learns where you're planning to fly and suddenly the price increases.
2019,5,"Nice app overral, cool features like multi trips that you can't find it anywhere else , pretty cheap prices , interface let you choose from many airlines and compare prices, I like the alert on prices to keep you informed if the fare changes"
2019,1,"Total and complete waste of time. Wish I could give negative stars. Can't filter out basic economy so it's totally useless. Download Hopper, much better app by far."
2022,1,"I use to use it all time for booking, but now it is a problem about searching flight, I try to uninstall 2 times but nothing change, it say about server problem. It happens everytimenow, swop to another app now."
2023,5,App is back to previous functionality. 5 stars. Note: please relay to development team add a filter option to filter out flights with (NO AIRPORT SELF TRANSFERS) or recheckins I travel with a bike and it's expensive and difficult to recheckin or switch airports
2020,3,"I use skyscanner always by websites on my pc. One day I needed outside home and.. it could be easier to use, I found it complicated. The website is really easy however, with a useful and clear interface."
2019,5,"l use this all of the time. No bugs, i set up three trips to Europe, and the layovers were all perfectly timed to get through security and customs, and meet my connecting flights with no problems."
2021,1,I booked through the application and my credit card is debited but the application returned error that they didn't get any money from the card. I have the bank notification of the successful operation but I don't have a ticket to travel tomorrow and no one to contact for resolving this issue.
2022,1,"I had bad experience with skyscraper. My case is still ongoing.I hv purchased my flight to Japan through skyscanner and tickets bought fr 3 PAX. The skyscanner has introduced the flight network to purchase the outbound flight. We bought in October 22 to secure our seats and paid 4680 sgd. However few days later, we saw there's chnges in the flight means we would missed our connecting flight. We request our refund. Nothing given yet fr a month plus now. The 3rd party gave same answer. Wait"
2021,1,"Have you ever study about UiUx?! What is this super bad, hard, confusing ugly looking search interface? Please bring back the old one or optimize that one to be a better looking and easier one."
2020,1,Sky scanner was one of my favourite apps. The update has got me searching for other apps. Google flights is my way of searching for flights now. I hope skyscanner can return to its former glory soon.
2019,3,"the price are not up-to-date, when you click in the price is different or the flight is not available, can go up to RM200 differences, but still good apps to check for cheaper flight, hopefuply they will do more better on this part."
2021,1,"Very slow. Poor design. No calendar where you can see costs for every day. The flights ""flicker"" after you search. This app sucks."
2018,5,I use a few apps to check. But skyscanner will be my first. Has most deals. One additional feature that would be helpful is indication that the airline on offer has free check-in luggage.
2021,2,"After new update it has became completely unusable in terms of user interface. You don't know where type dates, one way/return flights etc. Just a disaster."
2023,1,"Just use the website. Changing the currency in app doesn't change the number next to the price, and there's a fair difference between Chinese Yuan and USD! That pretty much defeats the purpose of the app."
2020,1,"It does not list specific prices on each day of the calender like the website occasionally does, which is the charm of choosing the most inexpensive route. Disappointing."
2023,1,"Its thw second time in a row that i am searching for a flight, get a price go through the entire buying process with your oartner (flight network and Trip) and at the end the price changes and i am asked if i want to pay 120 usd more. This is not acceptable, you should nit let your partners misguide your users."
2021,1,A huge scam. Shows tickets for non operational flights. This is a huge scam I'm worried if anyone got trapped in this application and pay them for flights that doesn't operate. Please check and confirm with the customer care of flights before booking tickets from here if that flight functional or doesn't exist.
2019,2,"Something happened. Used to be good. Not anymore. Certain flight routes excludes some airlines. Why? They don't pay? The app should be about user satisfaction. Please, include all airlines. (Check routes to Moscow)"
2018,5,"The app is amazing for finding cheap flights, and, if you're interested, cheap flights to just go somewhere for fun. Does not update flights being watched on app, but everything else great so far!"
2022,1,"What have you done to the app. You used to be able to pick dates and search anywhere, and see genuine flights. Now it leads you down a ruddy rabbit hole unless you search very specific details. Why change what wasn't broken? Terrible."
2022,1,"This app gone beyond other manipulating apps which changes fare as you search flights. This app shows cheaper flights and once you select a date, price becomes very high even for adjacent date. Disappointed."
2019,1,"Got stuck at ""where from"", I typed in United Kingdom and it was forcing me to choose an airport, which is pointless, I need to know what flights are available to where I'm going, from any UK airport. Disappointing, this app was so much better about 10 years ago."
2019,5,"best deal for flight,I have been using make my trip for the last 3 years but as my booking increased making my trip, the prize would have been expensive for me. But this app shows actual rate"
2019,5,"I like the app itself, one of the best on the market. BUT, the new logo is.. Well, I won't say ugly, but it does not ""say"" anything to me. The old one was far better. Nowadays, almost every logo is either red or dark blue. It's too simple. Every time I saw something turqoise, I associated it with skyscanner.. Now, all I see is a bikini with a half loading circle above it. Sun? Nope."
2019,1,"the worst apps I never seen, customer service more worst the hang up the phone if the want I missed my flight I try to call them they don't even wanna help me the hang up three times on me they charge me again full price, please people don't book flights through this apps they are scams they just take your money no help..."
2018,4,Great app for searching flights but it can be improved by giving option of adding multiple destinations and different inbound and outbound airports.
2019,3,"Some apps directly showing prices in calender dates but in this app not showing prices so this is my suggestion add this features and second thing is add on more features like tour packages like other apps ex..goibibo, Cleartrip, etc..."
2019,1,"Cheating app, the app saves cookies in order to increase flight costs when making a second look at the same flight, I've tried in different smartphones and the price is different, ecen when searching for the same flight at the same time"
2023,4,good option but costly
2019,5,so far so good. really happy and saves me time looking for flights and comparing and it does a good job offering the best prices! I tested it and compared to other airline apps and it really gives the best price. really happy
2020,1,i got scammed from booking flight ticket from here. they took my money but the flight got cancelled. they wouldn't return my money. Skyscanner working with travel2be. tlavel2be has taken away so many people money. there are over a thousand victims there. Skyscanner doesn't investigate the agencies. Don't use this application.
2018,5,"Been going back and forth multiple times between Melbourne and Jakarta, gotta say I'm impressed with the deals. Finding cheap flight couldn't get any better without using this app."
2019,5,"Very useful app to book air tickets, helps us to find out cheapest option by scanning all websites. Alert feature is too good which keep us posted with price fluctuation."
2022,5,Brilliant easy to use app. It has search functions which allow you to search all dates with a month and any destinations. Great for finding cheap flights
2019,5,"This app is simple, convenient and has the best deals. Everything you need in one place with no hassles. It tells you which dates you are likely to pay higher rates so that you know when to plan your trip to save the most money .I love it."
2020,4,"After the last update, explore section changed the way the flights are orderd. It used to be ordered by prices but now there is no specific order which makes it hard to find good prices."
2020,1,Used this app to book flights in April to zimbabwe. Used mytrip as shown by skyscanner. Since flights now cancelled looks like I have little to no chance of getting ¬£1600 refund. Giving this app 1 star cos they're happy to use rubbish travel companies.
2023,5,Best options and prices for Flights
2022,5,the best part and my favorite part is the explore everywhere thats shows all flights for months anywhere only problem sometimes its on my app sometimes it's not would love if it was constantly an option so I could find flights
2023,4,it's an add value i love it
2022,2,"Fix your filters, please! There is no possibility to filter out self transfer (I don't want these). When I filter out an airline it doesn't safe it when I change the date..."
2023,4,sky scanner Good for Air Travels. They show less prices and offers. I am little bit of English manage to understand.
2019,1,Slow to load. I went away and made a cup of tea! The filters wouldn't work so clicked back and it had lost the search! So tried again but so slow to load that I gave up.
2023,5,Nice And Easy App
2023,4,"flights prices are not updated regularly,"
2019,5,"I use this for every flight! easy to use, sensible search filters, good prices. it has never failed me in at least 12 separate trips."
2021,5,"This is the only app that solves the problem of finding flights based off of price rather than destination, for if you're the type of person who just wants to travel and don't have a specific destination in mind."
2021,1,"App keeps changing to the worse every update. Finds random price flights and doesn't go past ""choose provider"" button. The prices on original carrier websites don't exist."
2021,5,i like their services. they are pretty good at what theh do. although i would love to have if they can provide the whole thing like whole package booking and stuff like other travel websites do
2023,2,need a filter for no self transfer and changing airports
2022,1,Such a bad experience I booked tickets from this app for my guests came from out of India...after done the payment I received a mail for refund reference that is automatically decide by skyscanner and that will be in Ewallet without any information or confirming with me although I don't want to cancel my booking for my guest how they can send automatically for refund request by own decision if there is anything in emergency for anyone there no particular customer care number of Skyscanner
2023,1,"Dear sir, Skyscanner app is olnot working fine. It has been since last 7 days. Not able to even search for airports . I can even share the screenshot of possible."
2023,5,the best travel tool I've ever used. thanks
2020,4,"Good Day guys, It's a good application, I like it but 1 think you need to improve that's time format. There will be like 24hours and AM/PM. Overall it's a good platform to find the ticket in good price. Thanks"
2021,4,"Edited: Seems can now search again as I need, thank you. (Was easy to use, now cannot even choose from and where to fly. What has happened to the interface?)"
2023,1,Without connecting to Google or Facebook or make an extra email account nothing is possible. Not even just looking for flights. Thanks - NO
2018,2,"Love the app, have used it before, but it caused significant battery drain on my Pixel 2XL running Android Pie, 5th December patch. Uninstalled the app and battery life back to normal, shame."
2022,1,Unable to see all date options. Have to put in specific dates. I want more flexibility in order to find the best price!
2023,4,This is best app for flight information. There are also various cheap flight packages. There is only one place and there are different booking options.
2020,1,"Price hikes, click through deals find a price you like agree to price get ready to pay then on the last page they hike price upto nearly double the amount if the price isn't there or available don't waste people's time and energy looking."
2022,5,It's seems to be very very good app I can't explain how amazing is this and we can also review by filter button catch flights makes planes choose destinations you can wonder üòÄeverywhere üòÄand everything
2019,1,"Downloaded the app because of all the ads saying it would save so much money. Checked prices against other sites, and saved over $100 each by booking through another site. Do your comparisons."
2021,1,"This app sucks, each time when I'm checking ticket price, frost it shows one price and if you will press on that flight, price is way higher. Tired of it."
2022,2,"I have a bad experience with this app. The fees of cancellation or modification of flight is very hight, also the refund will take long time. So better to book directly from flight owner."
2019,5,This ap is so easy to use! the user friendly model is by far the best I've seen! I love that I can select nonstop and see when the best days are to fly in the entire month! I will be using this ap from now on to make sure I'm getting the best airfare!!
2022,3,"As per My friend recommendation, I am using this App, but there is scope for Improvement, Kindly Provide Flight Sort option By Time, so it will be easy to find the Flights."
2021,2,"Used for years and liked but needs option in settings to remove recently added greener choice banner from search results that is distracting, will find another flight search app to use, theres tons of them anyway"
2019,1,"Totally worthless app! I am in another country and when I try to update my profile, it gives me all the choices in a foreign language! I speak English! Why can't I have the profile in my native tongue? I will find an app that works!"
2019,4,"Good app since you can view different price range from every other airline. But when you view to the original site, the price range is high.üòëüòëüòë"
2021,5,I have been using Skyscanner for a long time now. I search for tickets and visit the website to find same rates. The best part about the app is that it tells you which date has cheapest prices for your location
2019,1,"This app just didn't work. took several attempts to find ""london"" as ""from"" and gave up after several more attempts to enter ""malaga"" as destination. Poor."
2023,5,easy & fast
2023,1,"Not helpful alerts. App downloaded, notification received, after clicked on, app opens, app goes through progress bar and then proceeds to show nothing relevant to saved price alert"
2023,2,the old version graph flight mix n match was better.
2019,5,"Excellent options. On the whole, the best deals are found through Skyscanner. Have used it over 20 times for flights in the last 2 years."
2019,1,some odd permissions for a booking app. why does the app require permissions for wifi settings and other connected devices? in what way is that relevent to booking a flight?
2023,4,"Easy to use, but no arabic language"
2023,1,Absolutely useless. 'Where to' and 'where from' is blank and doesn't allow you to input anything. Uninstalled 2 minutes after installing.
2022,1,The preview in the calendar show a price that actually it's not correct. If I remember well before was quite close to the actual offers.
2023,4,I love the app because it's easy and simple to use. The app gives you variety of airlines to choose from and the option to select the service providers.
2023,3,Good app. But why not having the Direct Flight only check box on the main search console ? (When this is available on the website). That is a shame because this is such a key criteria for most people.
2019,5,the app was very helpful and easy to use. there are hundreds of affordable choices across different airlines with an outstanding options. üëçüëçüëç
2023,1,a lot of the agencies do the bait and switch with the price. low price offer but then when you go to pay the price jumps up by triple.
2023,1,"I really don't like the app! Almost impossible to find cheap flights unless you know the exact dates. I have to use the desktop version, which is much easier to use."
2023,5,Very quick and efficient app. I particularly like the month overview option which allows me to better plan my trips.
2023,1,Low prices and huge scam from the sellers. I'll never book again from skyscanner. I've lost 2000$ using a agency from your app.
2023,1,Keep on getting price alert even when I have cancelled the alert. Pathetic ü§¢. Night at 2 am it will give a alert and no way to stop receiving them. Best is stop all notification!!
2023,1,Awful. Forgets filters everytime you modify or look at alternative dates. Adds random other airports and no option to choose same departure and return airport
2023,5,Iove the app. But for the past few weeks I have been unable to search flights on it. It keeps telling me that I have been dropped out of their server even though I do have access to well working internet. It's very frustrating.Can I get some help please?
2023,1,"Please, add direct flight option from the beginning, like the desktop version, if not is a mess (not a filter option for each search results like now)"
2023,1,The app shows one price when you select the date but 10 times higher price when you click on search. Changing dates don't work
2023,5,Skyscanner is a great app for the cheapest flight tickets.. I haven't seen any other app that provides fares at these price points.. I highly recommend this app..
2023,1,We buy tickets 7 tickets through your website with travel up but unfortunately this is very bad experience for us. I have some visa issue but they give no help no information and when we said for refund tickets they refund only 187¬£and we pay 5000¬£
2023,5,Book tickets from this site... at least 6-7 times!!! Never had any problems with them!!! Always had lowest prices for my flights...
2023,5,Truly trustworthy app. I could always book my tickets in the top airlines at the cheapest price possible. Thanks Skyscanner.
2023,4,The app is amazing as usual. But the swap function is not working in between To and Fro textbox
2023,1,"App doesn't seem to be working properly , won't show many dates , select a month option doesn't work"
2022,1,"This app doesn't give you the ""cheapest"" prices üôÑ i went to a search engine and found flights for $282 round trip and opened this app to compare prices and the same flight on the same date comes up about $150 dollars more!! Uninstalled!! ü§¨ü§°"
2022,1,Unable to login with my email after logout although input the correct verification code. This issue must be on skyscanner server side. Please fix this issue asap. Thanks.
2022,1,"Don't booking from the following app, it's not trusted app, I am booked two flights to New York city with 700 dollars, in last week but they cancelled my flights to day and not refund my payment, can not calling customer service, not trusted, customer support is dead, It is my experience,üò£üëéüëéüëéüëé‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è don't book from this app"
2022,2,"Horrible experience. I found tickets on Skyscanner and was forwarded to another app which is ""alrehlat"" I paid the money and have been waiting for a week now without any proper feedback"
2022,1,"Unhappy about this app, i chose a flight price from Male to Dublin was 1200 euros when i access the buy page it gave me a price of 2000 euros i used another app to buy flights and i got an offer of 1500 euros for same destination. Shame on such offers, robbery"
2023,1,Downloaded app. Opened app. Pick a hotel. Would not go to hotel page. Useless. Too many apps out there to have one be not user friendly.
2022,4,Great app. I use it all the time to book or research flights. The interface could be a little more modern imo though.
2023,5,absolutely satisfied with this app super easy to search
2019,3,the changes to the search facility are awful. put them back. my recommended departure airports are all in Scotland despite the fact ive searched from newcastle a million times. poor update.
2021,1,"I did not use app but try to contact them via facebook page, but nobody help and give me answer, even contact them via contact option in their website,said will contact and help within 24 hours. And nobody !!! That is not fine working from them !"
2023,1,"stuipd user experience and interface, how i book a flight without knowing if there's a baggage included in the ticket or not?!"
2022,5,This is the best app in the world to book flight tickets at cheaper rates. Thank you so much Sky Scanner for searching us flight options which are cheap and giving them at lowest costs. You will receive many good blessings. Grateful
2021,1,Wow üòÆ Horrendous! Congratulations Skyscanner on completely ruining a formerly brilliant travel app. I can't use that garbage that you have created at all. Opodo it is from now on until you revert to the old style. Farewell üò¢
2019,2,"Its level of flights are going down , the options of flights are worse then flighthub an Calgary flights are only cheap when its round trip but Vancouver one ways are cheaper which also I dont understand? This app was good but the updates seem to have made it worst ."
2023,5,best and cheapest ticket booking in india..
2020,1,Since the recent update the app is useless. You can't do a simple flight search from one city to another. It's unclear how you can set the departure city. I'm now searching for other app to replace this.
2022,4,The app is good and one thing i have discovered is that it can track your location and show you the nearby hotels so you cant get stranded in any way because the app is there to serve you with any information you need.
2019,5,Great app for finding best prices. Does not keep going up in price if you don't buy like some online sites do. Highly recommend if you do much traveling.
2021,1,"How did you manage to ruin one of the most intuitive and simple apps? It is almost embarrassing. As it is, the app is completely useless. No way to select dates and routes. Please downgrade. Sometimes less is more."
2020,5,"Love Skyscanner. Travel abroad a lot (when i can/could) It gives you reminders of price fluctuations on flights, times and carriers. Recommend it to anyone"
2023,1,noticed increased prices for Ryanair flights on here than on their own website
2019,1,"1 star because your App starts automatically after an update, which is annoying as hell, especially when you're writing something and all of a sudden this app stops you from doing what you were doing. I wonder what the intent of an auto launch is other than annoying the hell out of people"
2023,5,"A very Good experience with skyskanner having alot of options in Hotel Search,Car rental. Easy to use and accurate in results. Just love it"
2019,4,When i have a plan to travel mostly i used this application but there is an issue for fixing when i try to choose the hotel there is no respond hopefully you can fix it thank you skyscanner
2019,4,"best app to just shop flights or continue to purchase flight. Ive used several of the vendors and had good luck, easy and cheap if you know what you want without coaching."
2023,3,The app keeps crashing whenever I use it.
2021,1,with every update it makes the app limited. the nive feature of the old versions was the barchart for flights and return flights. i am so dissapointed...
2020,1,What the hell happened?! It was one of my most used tools and now either I am too stupid to make a basic search or you made it so complicated it makes me want to throw my phone away. Please change this new interface pronto!
2023,3,"Some of the third party sites generating flights, are not trust worthy or are not providing accurate information. In some cases appearing fraudulent. Because this app is guiding me to those websites I no longer trust Skyscanner to provide accurate information"
2019,5,great app for planning if you are not sure where you want to go yet. Plug in a start point and get options of places to go.
2019,2,Disappointed with the new app hard to navigate and not user friendly. Not sure how to scan multiple city flights.
2018,5,"Fantastic, easy to use app. Great search options, ability to watch deals. This app makes planning a trip so much easier."
2022,1,"Wrong prices, can't show flights, App just plain doesn't work. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted my phone, doesn't matter, your app is broken."
2020,1,App is far too cumbersome to use. I can't find the feature that allows you to search whole months and then shows the price on each day.
2022,1,Zero quality control on their travel providers. Booked flights through Skyscanner with eDreams. Flight was cancelled and now have waited 6 months for refund. From now on researching here but never booking direct through this app - a back door for scam travel companies.
2022,4,"Good. But since the updated colours on the prices each month, it is difficult to distinguish...I am mildly colour blind. Why not green, amber, red, empty where no info?!"
2021,2,Time to go back to the cheaps flights app. No longer any marking to tell which days have cheap flights and some flights not found that definitely exist. Sky scanner has gotten worse.
2023,1,Just noticed that you guys are blatantly paying for fake 5 star reviews. Boy that must be embarrassing to result to such a low to keep ratings up. Months and months go by without any improvements to the app so the negative reviews shouldn't shock you. But instead of fixing issues better to pay for 5 star reviews. Laughable.
2018,5,Great app! I saved a lot of money by watching my flight and was notified when the price dropped! Booked it right away and locked in the low price ü§ì‚úåüèª
2022,2,"Searched for flights in April, and it showed me only flights in October. Couldn't find how to use this app for its most basic functionality. Going back to the website."
2019,1,"if this it's the original Skyscanner, it's a crazy lost of money who sell you this upgraded logo and app Sistem destroy everything what makes you useful. just find cheap flights no more people don't use this apps to book any stupid add-ons bad bad bad business decision. and the logo OMG please seems like a dairy company logo just need a cow and complete the logo they just copy n' paste from google"
2019,1,"Skyscanner sent my flight detail to random email that isn't mine. That email is completely random and not even the one I used to book the flight. It's very unsafe since random people/email got all my flight details. When I check the booking ID to the airlines (air asia), said my flight detail has been sent to random email and they could not find my flight detail through the booking ID Skyscanner gave to me. Skyscanner please read my emails and cancel flight + refund my ticket !!!"
2020,5,"Great app, easy to access you can see the cheapest price on the calendar and it will show you the short distance flight first that's the good thing."
2023,5,best one for the flight ticket booking
2023,5,"One of the cheapest third parties out there (at my search day and date on Monday, 29th may) and absolutely simple to use. However, there was an airport which hasnt been updated to its latest name"
2023,5,nice app and service
2023,5,Best app for flights booking
2021,5,"i always like to research before travelling and i like skyscanner. Most of what it predict is right in terms of flight rates, hotel reviews and good times to visit a place."
2019,5,"If you have to rely on ONE flight aggregate app, THIS SHOULD BE IT. I use lots of different apps for finding the best flight deals, and Skyscanner consistently delivers the best prices."
2022,1,Terrible UI. Can't see flights for whole month. Unclear of how to search for direct flights. It's easier to use the normal website than this app
2022,2,Price is good. But third party websites booking is complicated and not customer friendly. Site error etc are happening. Hence couldn't book the ticket. Overall not happy.
2018,5,"Excellent, fast and goes through alot of airlines to help find flights. Should try sign up with more airlines to be an even better provider and get cheaper deals. But love it"
2019,1,"Used to be a great app now messed up with overcomplicated search results and filters, if it ain't broke don't fix it !!."
2021,1,"The App used to be amazing, my go to app for all flights. Since all the updates it has become unusable, to the extent I'm now just uninstalling. I cannot fathom why you had such a simple and amazing app for flights and then destroyed it. Why?!"
2019,2,"Fast to find flights but this app delays the price changes and also I see more higher prices when goint to the official company website. I had selected notification feature but ,even I havent got price change alert."
2020,1,"Seems to send customers to 3rd parties and support refuses to help sort out problems once they have done that. Uninstalled, using another app."
2019,5,i have used this app scores of times and every time the service i received and the facility i enjoyed was exceptional. The only place i can fearlessly punch my card details without the slightest of fear or uncertainty of any fraud. Always the first choice...
2019,5,"My favorite flight search app. Clean and easy to use, great interface for exploring options by month."
2021,2,"I book with one of their 3rd party providers (smartfares) just to be a scam. They not only charge me twice but they they didn't have the flight!!!! im now on the hook for $1,600"
2019,5,"I use for all the trips I do, searching, considering and balancing out the possible dates. With this app all that just feels so smooth and productive."
2023,3,there are other players too like you
2023,5,Great app with lots of travel perks!
2023,5,get your best and cheap ticket... save money and time no need a Travell agent
2022,1,"The worst day for me is the day that i use this site.your partner is not trusted at all.i payed the money and after two days your partner skytours says please pay more because the ticket price increases and we didn't confirm with airline flight. After two days from payment, they wakes up to execute the reservation and found that the prices changed so they need me to pay more additional money. Please choose your partners ,because customer like me will not reserve using you again"
2019,5,"easy to use and quite helpful to pick lower cost flight days without blinding looking day after day, although the app did offer a table graph feature in an earlier version I do miss."
2021,2,Worst update to remove the live map from app and redirect to browser. Was easier to use before so many bad updates making it harder to navigate thru different dates/months for prices comparaison.
2022,1,Another good app needlessly ruined. Loss of functionality to search for flights +/- specified date range and HORRIBLE UI & UX. Uninstalling.
2022,1,It is just horrible. Flight search date change is just terribly designed. Shame on skyscanner. Not using this anymore. They ignore all the negative feedbacks. Destroy their own business.
2019,5,Love the app....makes it easy to find the best rates on flights ana car rentals and then book it. Using for many years without any problem
2023,5,"nice app, to get latest update from various flights to choose. I like it"
2021,1,Kind of irritating to see complicated layout. cant able to find fares for whole month in single window. by default it puts my last seached location. reinstate old layout please.
2020,1,"The new updated search designed to be intuitive for Boomers is retarded. It makes Skyscanner the worst app on Android. It takes a lot of skill to make an app this terrible, your designers should all be sacked. Roll it back ASAP."
2019,2,"Whenever I look up flights about 9-10 months out it always says there are no flights available. But then when I go to the website and search the same info, I'm offered 30 different flights. I'll be using the website from now on."
2020,5,"This app is Amazing! Just booked my 5th flight with this app and its saved me So much money all together. This is my main flight and hotel finder, by far the best when it comes to deals and giving recommended travel destinations."
2021,1,I dont know how everyone else is finding flights - all I get it the same plane doing circles on the screen. Have tried to restart change dates - nada still the same.
2019,5,very useful...like the way app is developing. used twice worked well. transition to airline site for purchase worked very well.
2023,3,Can't keep the filers. Always have to set the same filters again if changed dates. A bit annoying.
2019,4,"I'm pretty happy with this app. It does a good job of giving the flight options and prices. I would give it 5 stars, but it doesn't always give consistent pricing for smaller airports."
2021,1,SKYSCANNER used to be my go to place for Worldwide Travel. Unfortunately it's new owner has altered the algorithms and the site its no longer useful. Such a shame to see a great product diminished...
2018,5,"Incredible app, Simple, Comfortable and useful. I'd love to see a price chart like the one in the website but other than that It's great!"
2019,3,the widget is gone! this useful feature to track travel plans is no longer available. At least inform us why a major feature has been removed.
2019,5,"I've been using Skyscanner, almost exclusively, to book flights for five years. The app funtions very nicely and provides a good experience."
2019,4,"I'm a bit disappointed with the update. The ""save this flight"" option doesn't work anymore, I always get an error. Used to be a great feature to check pricing."
2020,5,"I used skyscanner to get estimates when flying to Japan last year. So helpful! I went to some airline's website directly and prices were listed around 950, skyscanner showed me there was a similar flight for 751."
2022,1,"It's a very bad app, very very very very bad. Just use Google flights. It's impossible to use, horrible design, poor results . Just don't publish yourself by using this absolutely awful sad excuse for an app. AWFUL."
2022,1,"Install this at your peril. Almost every other day the developers change their mind about the software they've just published, & rewrite it & expect us to download it again & again & again....Months later & they're still doing it. It's purely done to try to continually draw your attention to their product."
2023,5,Love this app. Never looked for a different app just cause this app has neen the all time best
2019,3,"It's OK. Sometimes it has the best prices, sometimes it doesn't. It doesn't update automatically, which is ridiculous in 2019. And I'm not convinced the clear history function actually works, based on its behavior."
2019,5,Great way to work out which flight is best for you. Use the explore option of if you'd like a broader picture of what's available.
2019,1,Keep's crashing. Won't pas startup screen before crashing. Used to work fine. EDIT: Still crashes after re-installing.
2019,4,Had it shown the related informations like transit visa requirements etc. then it could have achieved 5 star rating!! There is no merit in showing sleep plan and public transport availability as these are quite obvious from the timings
2018,2,"This app is useful for getting idea of pricing on flights. However if you try to book through the app BEWARE because it uses third party booking services, some of which have an F rating from the BBB."
2019,5,hotel options doesn't work and if you once tap on hotels option first then flights option also doesn't work. edit- they have resolved this issue.
2023,1,Well if you want to just enjoy the lowest rates for fun then this is good app. But the lowest rates doesn't exists here. It shows lowest and attractive Prices but when you click to go for the further procedure those lowest rates converter to higher even double rates. Very disappointing even hearting. üò≠üò≠üò≠
2019,5,"I love that I don't have to pick a specific destination. I normally plan trips around wherever I can get a cheap flight to, Skyscanner helps with my cheap flight roulette!"
2020,5,"I love this app and I was using it for years. Yes, recent changes were not the best. But I see developers taking their time to respond to each review and working bringing the come back to previous concepts so I'll will stick to it. Thank you!"
2022,5,First class app for great and affordable fares. u can travel anytime anywhere on this app if u have the means. its a MUST HAVE APP for tourist and travellers of all classes.
2023,2,"The worst experience as I was left stranded and airline insisted I speak with skyscanner. Without a face, I think skyscanner sucks.. like everything Without a face . Never again"
2019,4,great app to get plane ticket pricing. usually gives the best deals online. easy to use and provides lots of info. totally recommend it.
2023,5,Its one of the best app to look for air tickets
2019,5,I am using the Website from more then 5 years. I also booked some tickets for the friends and had a great Experience. you could find the best price. Fully Recommended !!
2019,1,Had a friend recommend this app is the go-to for the best flight cheapest flights around finally got around to downloading it and all I got was a bunch of information about CO2 emissions and the prices and flights were about average with other sites that do the same thing but I was moved by all this talk about CO2 and realize that by flying at all I was contributing to global climate change so I decided not to fly at all and deleted the app because I have no use for it now
2019,5,Great app use all the time for domestic & international flights. Have booked more then a dozen flights saving alot of money. A must use.
2023,5,Always our go-to site for multi airline flight prices
2019,1,"Crop. Most of the deals are outdated and when you get to the booking website, the deal is already gone plus search is way too slow"
2018,4,"Decent flight finder app. Have not purchased a flight yet, so will add more to rating once I do. So far, I like the search functions."
2023,1,"Installed and used for around 10 min before uninstalling as it's useless at finding flights, just kept getting error messages"
2023,1,This is the second time I use the app and got robbed. The policies and extra insurance you would pay for doesn't mean anything. Took my money with no trip. And customer service is a joke. Never again.
2023,5,"Amazing app, has helped me travel the middle east and Asia this year and now in the process of planning me next trip. Super easy to use and gives accurate information. I highly recommend."
2023,5,it's just reducing my time to select the best flight and best booking website. Totally loved it.
2023,4,found my cheapest flight on skscanner
2019,5,Easy to use. Really straight forward with filters and showing full travel details. Can't fault this app at all. 5* üòä
2023,5,bestum best ever service provider
2023,5,really appreciate the updates üôè
2023,1,very very worst app
2023,1,rate changes the moment I proceed with booking
2023,3,prices keep changing
2023,5,great application all in one app
2023,1,"The app will show a lower prices in the calendar than it actually gives you, also will list very VERY sketchy providers."
2023,1,prices keep increasing every minute after the search!
2023,5,"Has the best international flight leads, ice-breaker for me."
2020,1,What happened to our beloved Skyscanner? üò≠ The app is unable to make price trend/predictions between Frankfurt and Seoul. This feature was the main reason I used the service. Guess Hopper will have to suffice. Really disappointed.
2019,3,"Great app but why can't you filter departure time both ways, leave before a certain time as well as leave after a certain time like on the browser version..."
2023,5,very reasonable and fast
2023,5,Good site to compare prices of different airlines and different combinations and to plan journey accordingly.
2023,5,Cheapest price and very Affordable
2023,1,"Amount deducted, but didn't get ticket. Please avoid this app"
2023,5,"they always have great deals, they are my go-to site."
2023,5,can compare different criteria.
2023,1,now a days its not showing properly. something has changed because i dont see cheap flight..but other apps are showing
2023,1,Worst experience. Don't book from here. They charge unnecessary.
2019,1,"This app was great before the update... now I'm not sure on what is going on but I have been trying to book for a flight and I can not find one flight, I try to use different days, time even 2 stop flights and nothing.. I even try different cities... and I just can get not flights."
2019,2,Reserved flight and found out that my purchase never went through via email the next day. Had to rearrange plans and scramble to get another flight. Is that Skyscanner's fault? I don't know but first impressions last a long time.
2019,5,"Why there are no detail about the flight that used to be on iOS version that I previously used? I wanted to know how wide the passenger seat space and plane are, like I was able to find those data on iOS version. Please make that feature available on Android version too."
2019,4,"The app is very good. But it would be better if the function to select ""whole month"" to change to custom range."
2019,4,It's very useful for my searches. I do wish I could select diff date/time combinations. It's annoying that I have to scroll to get to a combination that works for me.
2019,5,"Great app, I like the feature where you can select every destination at any time to find the cheapest ticket options."
2020,1,"What a terrible TERRIBLE update!! In uninstalling it for a while, maybe try it again in a few weeks, see if they bring it back to the way it was before this update, when it was usable"
2019,5,"Flexible, easily adaptive and user friendly. Suggestions and options aplenty. Skyscanner is now my only go to trip finder/planner app"
2020,5,the best app to get the fantastic ticket to bring us home. Many time when you want to go somewhere with your budget but you can not reach it but it not going to happen on this app . well reccomment.
2018,5,"It is so friendly to search any thing;like hotels,flight,hire care and the best part is the way rated thing appear.. Simply very helpful for eager ones."
2019,1,"Major invasion of privacy! just been notified the app has been detected using my camera, when that permission is turned off. major invasion of privacy!!! I would like a response asap please to explain"
2023,4,"The only con is sometimes it shows the pricing lower than when you reach the websites, it then hikes up. other than that it's up there with Google Flights, sometimes better in accordance with pricing"
2019,1,Security notified me that this app used my camera while it was running in the background and my phone was asleep. This app does not even have permission to use my camera. Don't install this app if you care about privacy.
2019,2,confusing most of the time. agree design and everything else is cool but ux it's really hard to get a grip on how things works.
2019,5,"This app doesn't notify you just to advertise something. I really like that. I like that it shows prices With the taxes, etc. That has always bothered me about other apps."
2023,1,"This app used to be excellent, you'd pick a month and could easily see the prices for the whole month but now it seems to just randomly select dates it hopes you'll buy. Absolutely rubbish."
2020,1,This is what happends when companies try to fix things that are not broken. The new app design done by schoolkids? My suggestion. 1) sack the developer and IT head 2) reinstall the old version from your backup 3) delighted customers ans peoblem solved. I have already moved on
2019,5,My only go to app for flights around the world. Please continue with the job well done! Best if the platform also includes the land transfer price or advises as not all users will have the land transfer option included in their hotel package.
2019,5,Easy to set filters and love that it shows you prices for the whole month so it's easy to make adjustments to accommodate your budget
2021,2,"The most unreliable app. When you click to check the prices, the actual flight costs as much as 4 to 5 times what the app shows."
2023,5,Really it's very helpful app and get more information about rental cars and hotel. It's much information you are providing. By this app. This will be helpful for me in future . And I will suggest my friends those travel rarely .
2020,1,I book the ticket through Skyscanner it's been 4hours I still not get my ticket money deducted from my account. Even my transaction does not visible in the APP. I'm trying to call the customer care helpline number but they did not answer my call..
2019,2,Was excellent now easier to check on PC. Have to select dates first. Huge leap backwards in end user ease of use. Google flights now prefered choice
2018,1,Your guys are really bad. First you offer ridiculously long flying hours (2 to 3 times the regular hours) at a cheap price and then try to make up for it by ripping off the customer on baggage. I was asked to pay USD 230 for a 20kg checking luggage. You people should be ashamed of yourself!
2022,5,I've never experienced such an intuitive and efficient system for overall flight booking and management. Thank you so much. I can't recommend it enough!
2019,4,I have been flying over this app and I feel really secure. For now everything went as planned every time. Also best offer I could find anywhere. 4 stars just not to get too comfortable üòâ
2019,3,"When I see the best offers of each month it appears to me as a very good price but when I click to book, it's a completely different price.."
2020,5,The button to do month search is in the upper right corner when searching dates! A bit confusing and at first I thought the feature was removed.
2022,5,"I love the ""Explore"" feature. I use it to find random travel destinations at unbelievable prices. Love love LOVE IT!"
2018,5,"Have used this app for 8 years now, ever since a work colleague put me on to it. It is always my first port of call for flights and has always provided on its promise. I thoroughly recommend this airfare site."
2020,2,Very useful app till last update. It get stuck on black screen. Samsung galaxy Tab S2 user. Please fix it! ADDED: Even tried to remove/reinstall the app not solve.
2023,2,"Where to, where from - pages are blank. Was working 3 days ago. Installed on a Lenovo M10 tablet Android 10. Have reinstalled, cleared cache, cleared data. Still not working. Working no problem on an Oppo A9 Android 11."
2019,1,It would appear the update doesn't allow you to see the prices in graph form. Specific dates only. We don't all require specific dates.
2018,3,"Limited filter options. On the website, I'm able to select frequent flier programs, and the app does not allow me to do so"
2021,2,"Prices rarely match when you go through to book. For example, rtn flights from Heathrow to Chicago for June 2022 quoted as ¬£508 with American Airlines, but when you go to book they want to charge ¬£628. What is going on??"
2020,1,Over all this good aap. But at the time of covid 19.. when there is location down. This no support in this app.. no flight cancelled policy and no refund policy.. I request my refund my ticket on last August.. but as of now no refund.. ????
2022,2,"some of the website included in the suggested site to use for booking is not fine, so when you transfered to them to book , they play dirty games and say the offer is not here any more and goti another one with more money."
2021,3,This version is how I want it to be. However the option when you had a chart with all the prices available was a lot better for me.
2022,2,"Used to be great, description wrong, less info on calendar, like daily prices. Must search each day separately, very time consuming."
2019,1,"Hi! I am currently downloading the app but for some reasons, it only says download pending. It is the only app I am downloading. Restarted playstore several times but still got the same response. Can someone help me? Thanks."
2019,5,"Without a doubt, this is the first place to look when booking, or even thinking about booking flights. I fly frequently and this is my Go To place. Thank you@skyscanner"
2023,1,It is a request to All please don't buy any ticket from sky scanner because there are end no. Of fraud bookers. I have found six cases including me whose tickets have been cancelled in the last days. And refund has even not been given. It is a fraud people website Govt should take seroius action against this.
2020,1,"Beware, whilst the app will point you to the cheapest deals, Skyscanner does not ensure the travel companies they refer you to are registered or solvent. Many people have lost money due to companies collapsing in Australia that Skyscanner referred customers to."
2021,1,"I used to love this app. Now I can't navigate around it. For example, where has the multi city option gone? It wasn't broken, so why have they messed with it???"
2019,5,"Extremely good results, better than momondo or kayak. Clean interface, love the travel anywhere feature! Thanks."
2020,2,Why can't I have different filters for each saved seach/notification.? Home screen not great layout Saved searches should be easier to view. Used to be better appüôà
2023,1,Aimed at 1 traveller. Even though I put my whole family in it automatically uses 1 traveller to find flights etc. So even if I do a search with us all when I go on the flights it states 1 traveller. Not good.
2019,1,I would give this app zero if I could. For some reason it uses the camera on your phone. Received alert that is was using without permission. What would it need to use the camera for. Removed app immediately. HUGE privacy issue !!!
2019,5,Awesome! We used this app while living in Europe. Amazing deals. We would end up in remarkable locales that we would have never considered. Back in the US now and still using it.
2019,5,Whoa! What an app This app really amazed me as it changed my experience with booking flights. It catches those deals which other apps can't. Loved it!
2018,5,Good for checking prices for flights that are some time in the future but not for checking prices of flights which say are only a week away. Results of these searches can be inaccurate.
2019,5,"Always use Skyscanner to checkout prices, especially multi-city travel. Dependent on the pricing by company, will yhen use Quidco if the company offer discount on flights for additional reduction. Definitely recommend other travellers to use this app."
2021,5,Full if useful information where we can travel to. As well as providing the original service of finding the cheapest flights... Great app! üòÇ
2019,5,"Easy-to-use app that saves me money on flights! The alerts keep me notified about price drops, and I can buy when the price is best!"
2019,1,"No longer works since it started bringing back fictitious prices from 3rd party flight search engines which make you click to get to their site. Sort it out, Skyscanner!"
2022,2,Doesn't allow you to pick whether you want refundable tickets or if you want first class or business class in the filters. This is no better than just doing a search on Google Flights.
2019,1,Used to be great but this upgrade makes it unusable. Can't find the multi trip option. Layout is poor.
2019,1,"Completely inacurate pricing. Skyscanner quotes ""lowest estimated price*"" but the actual price usually ends up being +$300-$400 more than estimated. This app is a total waste of time so I am deleting it."
2022,1,"why are REVIEWING price alerts not part of this app? You can set them, but you can't check on them through the app, has to be through email or the website WHICH basically defeats the purpose of having the app..."
2022,1,"Why are my saved flights not available to view, yet when I start a new search of the same flights, they're available? Quite annoying when it's a multi city trip- having to input all the information again"
2021,1,"New update is terrible. The only good features that differentiated your app from there rest were taken away. Went from 5 to 1 star in one update. Very disappointing and hope you change it, else many would have to change app"
2019,5,"fantastic, everytime I've used it works perfectly with tickets & invoice sent direct to my inbox, never a problem when we get to online check-in all ticket records are as it should be."
2019,1,"Disappointed with the app, it feeds you to a third party and then the third party says the ticket at that price is no longer available. Just terrible. Uninstall Now!"
2020,1,"The app artificially fluctuate the price just to force you to buy. And once you buy it, the price goes low down. It has happened twice to me and same with my friend. It is absolutely unethical."
2020,2,"You used to have the covid 19 info live travel map in the app üôÑ Where did it go? What happened to it? At these challenging times, that feature is a must, and with the new updates u took it off üôÑ"
2019,1,Heard recently that a lot of people have been duped by fake agents aligned to Skyscanner. This has faded all trust i had for this application. A no if people have filed compalints for the same. Uninstalling the app as not trustworthy!
2020,1,"I recommend you take another look at the UI. I'm stuck in my flight search, can't reset or select anything."
2021,1,What a waste of time. Trying to find flights and won't connect. A stupid message with a bike saying 'looks like we lost you for a second' Good job competitors offer a better service.
2021,5,"Love the interface, hassle free, simple, best prices always, lots of details about the flight included, my go-to app for flights!"
2019,5,"Simple and easy UI, has all the filters for searching different flights and gives a thorough search results."
2019,1,"Unfortunately, this app is a joke! I have tried to book a flight 3 times from different sites. The prices ridiculously change after you try to confirm and book them out."
2019,5,One of the best apps on my phone. It saves a lot of time and money to search and book flights via Skyscanner. I have been using this for 4 years now. Excellent !
2019,5,User friendly. everything you need. improvements: make sure luggage fees are included in quotes clearly. make sure it is easy to contact 3rd party airline booking agencies in case of future issues. over booking should be banned
2023,2,Date prices are irrelevant by the time you book return they are meaningless from ¬£70 then changes to ‚Ç¨350 What the point in showing dsy prices if the are not relevant. Preferred the old app when you chose the best prices to suit your budget.
2020,1,Unusable. Seems like complete fake. You can't book tickets or it redirects to non excistent web pages. Do not trust this. Don't ever enter payment details. A scam.
2020,5,"I had a bad experience trying to refund a ticket with one of their partners, Travel2be, the customer service of Skyscanner was professional and assisted me with getting the refund finalized. Thank you Skyscanner team"
2019,4,Great app. Wish it gave smart options to get to the destination cheaper by using nearby airports either at source or destination.
2021,5,"The app works great, the pricing on results... not so much! Of course, we are rating an app here and how well it performs. That, is worth five stars."
2020,1,Skyscanner on the app or on there Web site provides false prices when you actually try to book the tickets. Showing much lower prices to get you to book then boom prices go up by a lot. Wast time
2019,5,"User friendly. More likely to find a better deal on this site than most others. I like the ""everywhere"" option for variety when your undecided."
2021,2,just give us a list of countries we can go to without quarentine on returning to the UK. We don't need all the editorial bull. Keep it quick and simple.
2019,5,excellent app for getting cheap tickets because it makes it easier to.find them by doing a monthly view best fare finder and also getaways just put your local airport to anywhere and it will show you lots of offers to getaway
2019,5,"Is an easy app and the option to give you better rates when you're flexible on departure and arrival, you can get the best price. absolutely best!!"
2019,5,"I'm new to this app, but what I've experienced thus far, I am pleased with. The app gives you a surplus of rates for different airlines. Looking forward to enjoying this app!"
2020,1,"No point since you can't see prices for the whole month anymore. They say to click on a date, and then the whole month shows, but that doesn't work....."
2018,5,Very easy to use. Easy navigation between app and booking sites. Some flights are available for booking within app.
2019,5,Literally my go-to flight app to get the beat deals. Hopper has a better color scheme and Google Flights has good deals but I do firmly believe Skyscanner has the best deals around
2021,4,This was a 5 star app before the update and the removal of the monthly price search. but really glad the sky scanner team take time to listen to users feedback and I hope to see this feature back soon
2021,1,"I was recently cheated by travelgenio , Showed a lower price and after putting debit card details , price automatically increased by 50 pounds. Also baggage allowance was zero, which is never the case with a good Airline. Daylight robbery !!! Pls choose your partners prudently as they reflect on you ."
2019,3,you do get cheaper flights. the only problem when you click a credit card the price is bit increased from what you expected to pay.
2020,1,minimal filters. bad user interface. don't even bother. I want to be able to filter by business class like I can with the browser.
2018,5,Finally an app that scratches my wanderlust itch. Can sort flights by price without a specific destination in mind. Love it.
2019,1,"The only reason i use Skyscanner because there used to be a home widget to advise the best price and date to go anywhere. Now the widget is removed, this app just became ordinary like any other flight search apps."
2018,2,"Simple interface but hardly user friendly and quite frankly, Expedia STILL beats it. Don't bother."
2020,5,"This is my go to app I use when traveling. Last 3 times I've tried to use it, it's saying flights are $10k plus? Its obviously not correct."
2020,1,"Name of the company, not just the app, should be skyscammer... Unreliable. Cancelled flight, but no refund, just sorry and some blah blah crappy excuse. Good bye and good riddance!"
2021,1,"New UI is horrid, also it doesn't find any results now although in the browser on skyscanner I can find that same route on those days..."
2018,1,"Doesn't work for finding good flights. Flights it found were more expensive , more stops, and more overall travel time than a Google search found."
2020,1,"What the hell did you guys do to the app, no longer supports the current version & can't update or reinstall the app. Cheers for completely stuffing up a good app you bunch of galahs. Fix it"
2022,4,The app is great but i would like to have a feature that allows you to see flexible dates also for multi city trips
2020,2,Did you remove the chart icon to view the month's flight costs????? It didn't show anymore after the latest update. It's my favorite part of your app. üò©
2018,4,"I like the app, but I prefer to use to website. Is easier and you can see the cheapest flight depending of the dates."
2019,5,"Easy to use, shows all carriers plus other travel sites that may offer their own price/discount and gives timely alerts for price changes in routes that I am interested in."
2022,1,1. Sort n Filter button embeddd too deeply. 2. Doesn't save my search preferences. Have to keep updating for every single search.
2022,1,"Terrible use skyscanner all the time over a good few years. Loaded skyscanner app to make it easier, now cant get any flight or price details. Useless."
2019,2,What have you done !! I used to be able to search flights everywhere and get a list according to price. This was exactly what I needed and now it's gone. Please return this feature or I'm sorry but I'll be gone . Thanks
2019,5,"App is easy, good, accurate and gives you the legroom dimensions on flights. But beware some of the ticket vendors as they can be vermin."
2021,2,"As a heavy user, im sad to see the app used to be sooooo much more user friendly. The new interface kills it and im considering switching to other apps instead.. can we get it back please"
2019,5,"this is the best way to get the best prices on flights, I've been using this platform over a year by now and had no problems at all, totally recomend it!"
2019,5,"Greatest app ever. feel like booking a flight for this weekend, next weekend, within a month, half year. this is what you download."
2019,3,"it's just that we are not sure of each provider's reputation. sky-scanner did not chexk their reputation, right? u have to do it yourself. go check out the reliability"
2022,1,"My ticket was not confirmed after booking through your advertised website BUDGETTICKET.IN, and I attempted to call them but received no response. Please stop promoting bogus websites. What's more aggravating is that I'm unsure whether I should book another ticket or wait for their response."
2018,3,"Good app, but lacks Kayak's sweeping functionality (+/- 3 days trailing) and has a poor ergonomy (think dots' colours on the calendar...)."
2019,5,Great app. To make it even better: make it possible to select multiple departure airports so you can compare prices depending on departure airport too.
2019,5,"I use this app all the time for everyone of my trips and even my daughters trips. She is not old enough to fly by herself yet so if i find a great ticket price, I call the airlines to schedule my unaccompanied minors travel and tell them the price of Skyscanner and they will honor it!!üíô this app"
2023,3,Sky scanner isnt a bad app but it will still allow other scammer apps like kiwi to advertise on their app. Please look into the amount of horrible experiences people have had from this company as a result of being promoted on your app. Kiwi should be banned
2021,2,Ive been using skyscanner for many years and ive never had any issue until my flight last 1 Jan 2020 with the third party travel agency called gotogate. Until now i did not get my refund. I hope that skyscanner would help me getting my refund. Thanks
2019,4,Really good for finding cheap flights to random places. If you have time and a little money and dont know where to go this app is great.
2019,2,may get the ideas and can compare. but we have to make sure the rates are correct. because some of the ticketing agents routed by the app are not geniune and may divert us to a an expensive air tickets.
2019,3,"Good apps to use if you've already known your time of departure. But if you want to search for the cheapest rate regardless of time, it's difficult to be used"
2022,1,Very expensive and also does not give you individual breakdown of prices charged if booking for multiple travellers including children.eg. if you add 1 adult and 1 child it will give you price of 700 times 2 which 1400 which is not correct as child will be cheaper so misleading prices..
2021,4,Very good app. Shows tickets of all price ranges both direct and non direct flights. Easy to navigate and use.
2022,5,"Great UI with a very cheap deals. Must try, it has wide variety of flights which you can buy for a very very affordable price."
2022,1,the prices shown here are different from airlines fares and due to that flight does not confirm bookings and money gets stuck. highly dissappointed as it's happening with me second time and my money is stuck with different airlines now and none has confirmed my bookings
2020,2,"Why why why. Everytime you make a change you make it more complicated. Do you speak to customers, especially those that travel a lot!? I'm do e, time for a new flight app!"
2020,1,"App is useless. It cannot find any flights, to or from anywhere, on any date. Every search I've done just says that it can't find any flights."
2018,5,"Simple and effective, exactly whats needed for a quick compare, just wish the other companies selling the tickets didn't lie about their ticket prices so we don't have to waste our time filling all the forms and on the last step they bump the price, you should remove any companies from your comparison results if they do this to your customers."
2018,5,"Very useful. Comparing flights, easy to find the one that suits you the best. Totally recommend this app :)"
2019,5,Easy to use and it provide. Comparison and results come with quickest/recommended flights options. Great app! Widely recommended.
2023,1,Terrible. If I could give zero stars I would. The changes have made it worse. It is now difficult to view the dates that I want to fly. They show lots of information that I don't need!
2020,1,This app used to be great allowing you to view the calender just like on the desktop site but now it's changed making it harder to view the cheapest fare!
2020,1,Hard to contact with the customer service. My flight got cancelled and I was not able to contact them. Poor application and service.
2022,1,The app has become useless. When search a flight it gives you one price. When choose a provider it's adds another ‚Ç¨30-40.
2022,1,It does not tell you how many bags the trip includes... It would be EXTREMELY helpful to let the consumer know how much the bags are going to cost when you choose to buy a ticket
2019,3,it's a gd app to gv u overview but ur bounded by their selections. it wud b better if we can customize each timing that we need n then b routed to the sites for the booking
2022,1,Just a junk vehicle for rubbish bait-and-switch upsells. Cheap Flights app is far better if you want to just check for airfares minus the peripheral junk extras.
2022,1,This app is very cheap and made for those who hardly travel by Air.They are more interested in people downloading this app and delete thereafter. Never download this app tickets are 3 time costly than normal.
2020,4,"I like this app, but it does not show any flights from Any City to St Helena, although SA Airlink is already operating flights there from Johannesburg. Fix this and I will change it to 5 stars"
2022,5,"While all the airlines and other websites are trying to rip you off, Skyscanner is a saviour. What a wonderful app. Can't thank enough. Really appreciate it"
2022,1,you used to be able to scroll different dates and see prices if you go days before or after the dates you specify. Now only shows exact dates which is poor for a COMPARISON App!!!
2018,4,I usually use another app for domestic flights in Indonesia but I found that this app is very helpful to inform me about the options for international flights.
2019,5,My first choice for cheap flights. Always reliable always friendly for the user. Great job from the developers.
2021,4,"The app is so user-friendly.. I wish u add an option to choose between flights in return flights, so if I like the first flight and I want to change the return flight"
2021,4,"After update looks much much better. Still small issue, after flight search, and when make step back, you need to enter all details all-over again."
2020,1,"Terrible, I want to manage my booking and I can't login. I'm told to confirm an email that has never been sent and can't get another one sent."
2022,1,Was given a real good price tried booking it and it wouldn't go thru. Then it finally made it to where I could get back on a few hours later but it was double the price .
2021,5,"Excellent app for finding all the best deals when travelling. Gives clear, competitive prices and the best times to take flights. Highly recommended."
2022,5,"When it comes to booking flight ticket, the very first app I open is Skyscanner. And to my surprise, I always find the price the most cheaper from every other sources."
2022,5,"As a travel agent, I use this app for booking there majority of my bookings.I highly recommend this to all those who love to travel and get the best deal for their money."
2022,3,"Please add the option to add checked luggage, so full correct price can be seen, otherwise it is just s nightmare to go to airline website to check what are the luggage charges. Its a waste of time and energy."
2023,1,"Useless app. When you book through the agencies they list, your tickets will be cancelled and SkyScanner will not do anything. App has no way to filter out agencies either. Do not use."
2019,1,"for some reason, all my saved flights has been deleted from my account. Then, i try to add it again. then it will dissapear again. please revert back to the previous version."
2022,5,Used to love this app. I loved the graph layout where you could see the best day to fly but can't seem to find it anymore.
2022,1,I booked a flight for tomorrow still no confirmation and can't view on the app but the money has left my bank üòí now I hav3 an email saying it didn't go through but they will refund in 10 days this leaves me with 0 money for my trip to samui... couldn't get worse
2018,5,Always use this app when searching for flights. Allows for easy comparison and sorting with convenient booking options.
2022,1,They try rush your decisions by sending notifications of price rises when you are trying to find out things like baggage allowance. There main aim is that you make a mistake with you booking and pay extra charges
2022,1,Would of rated no stars. Booked a flight through this app . The flight canceled and I ended paying twice as much. Go with priceline they honor thier deals.
2019,5,havent booked a flight yet but i know i will open skyscanner first when i wanna fly next. the app is so pretty and easier to navigate than most desktop flight searches - unless you wanna buy directly from your favorite airline anyway
2023,5,great tool to search for flights compared to Google flights is on par minus the explore all destinations feature so 4 star. Edit: explore all added so its a 5 star from me :-)
2021,1,i booked my ticket last may but the flight is keep on cancel this application i keep on rebooking with payment is not good until my flight date came still i dont have ticket which is i was paid already..it was not my fault its the airlines fault why should i pay for rebooking 2nd customer care is poor they dont solve my problem they keep on pointing others like its the airlines fault not us why dont u help the passenger
2021,1,Badly designed app. Won't let you edit FROM or TO whenever you want. I have to reinstall the app to edit travel preferences
2023,1,This app doesn't even deserve a single star.It boasts of providing cheapest flight tickets but as soon as you click to buy the ticket suddenly the ticket price increases.It's a CHEAP SCAM.PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY & YOUR PRECIOUS TIME ON THIS APP.
2018,5,Make me very easy for travel plan. i always get this app for option first and compare to the airline website. Trust and confidence. I like it
2019,5,"Great App I love this app for comparing prices and picking the right airline. Prices are the basic and baggage, seat selection etc may cost more but still a great app"
2020,2,Hopeless. Used to be good and quick to use. Finding it very hard to get flights just listed.
2019,5,I am a frequent traveller. I have been using skyscanner website for around 13 years. Now app has made it even more easy. best comparison for flights.
2019,5,"It's early days yet, having only used the app for flight alerts in last couple of days. So far I've had no problems. Functioning as expected. üëç"
2023,1,"When trying to find hotels, the filter keeps resetting to ""Price per night"" instead of Total Cost, needs fixing."
2023,1,Can't filter the search for direct flights only until you click on a specific route like you can on the website. Search proceeds to show you flights in the next two weeks from today even if you're looking for a flight next year.
2021,5,"The best application I've found so far for flight booking. Easy to use, smooth, no ads, and email alerts!"
2022,1,Please ask bravofly to stop misguiding customer I trust sky scanner not bravolfly I tried booking ticket through sky scanner it directed me to bravofly and bravofly gave me wrong ticket then they cancel the flight after asking me and refunded me ad voucher for use in bravofly and now they increases the flight cost and showing wrong rates outside and once you reach final page it changes they playing a smart way to steal money playing very dirty you guys should cancel their registration with skysc
2020,1,This was the best app for looking up flights. Your new update has made it the absolute worst. So difficult and cumbersome to use. I will be deleting it.
2018,4,Easy to navigate. Easy to book a flight. I use this app everytime I need to book a trip. I've been using it for about two years now and I haven't ran in to a problem yet.
2021,1,Please please please switch back to the old version! This new version is too difficult to maneuver. Not user friendly AT ALL.
2021,1,Poor communication and terrible experience with their unprofessional support team. Since August 30 I'm asking them to get an alternative flight but they couldn't help me out.
2023,4,Very informative and some awesome deals BUT numerous emails !!! Would be good if there was monthly advertising rather than daily !!!!!!!
2021,5,love this app more than Expedia and Kayak. This one allows me to check what month is cheaper and compare in a more efficient way than the others.
2022,1,"How the flight searching app can be politically influenced? It was one of the greatest search engines, but for now have to switch, very pity."
2019,3,"Well it was great, but after Update now it doesn't work or closes itself randomly. What did you do??? Uninstalled and reinstalled twice, now works just fine."
2018,5,Absolutely amazing app for finding affordable flights and things to do in a city. It's like Groupon for travel.
2023,1,Its an absolute disaster. The app shows economical price and by the team you reach checkout the price increases to 1.5x the shown one. Absolutely disappointed and digusted by the lack of integrety from these people
2021,1,Stay away from this app. It uses 3rd party vendors to schedule your flights for you and if you try to refund or cancel your flight they run you in a circle with excuses and do everything to keep your money and prevent you from refunding. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS APP. BUY DIRECTLY FROM THE AIRLINE YOU WISH TO FLY.
2022,5,This is an exception app for travel lovers specially and it helps to make your plan cost friendly. I have been benefitted by using this to make my plan more hassle free and within my budget.
2023,1,"Very bad experience. I booked flight ticket thru this app and lost the money, no ticket booked and also no refund. No any support from this app. I never recommend to use this app. If there is any option i will give negative rating to this app"
2019,5,"Love it's simplicity, ease of use and its features. Mainly the flight suggestions."
2020,2,"Was a good app until now. I'm not sure what they did but now it doesn't show the cheapest flights first it just goes in random order . Please change this back if possible,"
2019,2,This used to be my app of choice before they updated it. Now I can't search by cheapest month etc so I uninstalled it. Looking for a competitor recommendation.
2020,1,Annoying account making to use the service of the app. Not good for a product. Most likely garvesting emails to sell or Target more spam.
2021,1,I dont rate apps often. But I explicitly had to this time for the HORRIBLE new UI. It's such a hassle now it's ridiculous. I almost never want to use this app again.
2019,1,I had to get a refund from your service provider getafligh coz yesterday they confirmed my booking and today they emailed me that the flight is no more within the amount you paid we can book it on the next day within the same fee. What the hell !!!
2020,1,"Doesn't give a chance to see the proces of whole month, which was the only reason I was using Skyscanner before. Now the app is going to deletion."
2021,1,"Booked flights before COVID. All flights were cancelled. Now, I am requesting for rescheduling the ticket. No response from the ticket agents. No way to contact Skyscanner also."
2019,5,"Looking for flights to all over the world! Instant quotes for best prices, direct or 1-2 stops even cheaper! Travel the world on a budget! I am so grateful..."
2018,4,"Awesome app, but only lets me book for 1 passenger. If there is a way to search and book for 2 or more passengers, please let me know!"
2019,5,"Fantastic travel app , I use mainly for booking flights . App has all the filters required to tailor your flights , such as take off times , flight Duration and favourite Airlines and remembers the last search ."
2023,2,"The listing of all the Airlines is not updated. Airlines like Scoot, Jeju Air, T'Way, etc..... are not listed. This making the booking process difficult as the airlines booking informations cannot be found. Quite disappointed."
2019,5,"it's just the best. Southwest doesn't show results, but I think that's the only major one and no fault of SkyScanner"
2023,5,One of the best app in searching & booking lowest airfare in India which searches from all over the sites instead one person going from one site to another for finding cheapest fare!! Kudos to Skyscanner for making our lives simplerüëè üëè üëè
2020,1,Previously 5 stars...they've ruined this app. Much less user friendly UI than it used to be. Winner if it was tested at all. No longer a skyscanner user
2022,1,"Rehlat company is the worst experiment to book flight ticket It didn't give me confirmation for ticket and it didn't return back my money I called them many times without respond, moreover i will not use Skyscanner anymore because you don't protect the customer Kindly take an tough action with Rehlat company to respect the customer."
2019,5,Fantastic website and app! It allowed me to book the cheapest car rentals and flights in the last few years! Highly recommended!
2019,5,Easily the best option to compare flights. I travel a lot and have never come across cheaper and wider options than Skyscanner.
2019,5,"Thank you for this great application. It keeps me updated daily with the flight price, which is so much different than a week or two ago for the same flight."
2021,5,Great app to find cheap flights and hotels. I love the 'explore' feature which allows you to search for the lowest prices of flight in any month of the year.
2019,5,Very friendly user interface and easy to use apps for 1st time travellers or frequent travellers. Have fun with the apps and happy traveling peeps !
2021,1,"Ripped off 2x with this app. The second time was for almost $400 in flights. Trying Hopper, I hear its better and safer."
2022,1,"Broken all the time now. No matter what dates and numbers of passengers I put in, it just redirects me to a ""sorry there's been a problem"" page."
2020,2,This app used to be great. What happened to the graph feature that showed you the daily prices so you could pick the cheapest days to suit your budget?
2020,5,"Nobkdy finds the cheapest flights like sky scanner. Pack a sleeping bag and several books, you're going to be sleeping in an airport at least once, but its worth it!"
2020,1,"The new design of the app is confusing, horrible for making searches, . I would prefer the old version."
2019,1,the phone is over heat. really high temperature while running this app. this kind of situation wouldn't happen by other apps including games.
2019,5,"GREAT travel planner. No hidden fees, no annoying ads. No bothersome emails. It's just awesome."
2023,1,"i have booked through my flight ticket through TripoMate which Skyscanner suggested. But it is fraudulent company. It is scam. why you don't deal with your agences? I , as a Consumer get scammed and ripped off."
2020,1,New update and appearance is awful to use and makes searching for flights difficult and frustrating. Sorry.
2018,5,"Very helpful, compares between a lot of companies to get best deal, people there works on upgrading it periodically. Well done"
2019,1,worst app ever. dont book . its a scam. it will redirect to a 3rd party site and they will take the money but wont confirm your ticket. happend with me with bravofly. will sue this app in consumer court and bravo fly too. very disappointed and dissatisfied.
2022,5,"I like the app, but not show me other options when I booking flights from London - England to Cochabamba - Bolivia. I want to see connections via USA"
2021,1,Should be called Skyscammer. Shows great prices until it's time to pay then the price jumps by 50%. Same with all the providers I tried. Skyscanner used to work but not anymore!
2020,1,I think that the user julia cleveland described it the best. You were different than the other apps. Bring back the filter options that made you number one.
2022,3,"A big lesson learnt, is not to have a multi flight carrier with connecting flight's to other destinations as if one flight is delayed & you miss the other flight & your stuck at that Airport trying to organise your Journey & paying further ticket flight cost's just to get to your destination which is costly especially if there is 2 plus people you have to re-buy flight tickets for..."
2021,1,"Very bad experience! Becareful and don't dare to minimize the app, all the time you spent filling the ticket will vanish! I'm not going to use this anymore, unless they pay my time stolen"
2019,5,so easy to use. would be nicer to add the option to search for price on multiple dates at one time. example: (june flights between the 20th to the 30th); multiple departure flights one way or rounndtrip.
2021,1,What's happened to this app. Used to be able to search for the cheapest flights in the graph option. Now its gone. Just like every other flight app now
2022,1,"Only shows you city names, not State. No way to select the proper airport if looking for a specific one."
2022,5,"I love this app, it's my go to for flights and price comparison. I highly recommend Skyscanner to friends and work colleagues looking for good flight, hotel deals."
2019,2,"not giving actual prices, but using sketchy travel agencies as feeders for low fares. It became useless after the last update where you are hiding the seller name."
2018,5,I have used sky scanner to book every flight! No problems so far and fingers crossed will never have one.
2023,2,"Still does not allow to filter by ""checked luggage"" prices. Sick of finding great flights, only to find I'm comparing prices with and without luggage."
2019,4,Needs a way to delete search history or separately show price alerts so I can make a neat dashboard of of price alerts. Otherwise this rocks.
2018,4,Used it a couple times and was amazed by the flight details an price.. not a 5 star due to found a cheaper flight using Google once.. but still a 4.9 in my plate as of right now.
2018,5,"Super easy, fast and real.. I have used it to book three flight here in Europe and it works. No games or hidden fees."
2019,2,"(NOV03) - changed to 2 STAR, every now and then fails to load my upcoming trips. Need to re-install the app - its my favourite app, kindly fix this!"
2019,5,Been using skyscanner way back 2017.... took all my searches then book.... no issues up to this moment.... next flight is nearly approaching..... great job and please continue the good service...... thanks thanks thanks
2023,5,"This is down the best app I've downloaded since the beginning of the year. I highly recommend it, if you're a traveller and don't have this app then you're paying too much for everything."
2022,5,"Used to be my favorite so to find flights. Now I can't even figure out how to book a return flight. Devs, if it ain't broke, don't fix it! Edit: Works great again, thank you!"
2022,5,"They put alot of time and effort into this App!No hassle,No Bugs, just book and go! If only all travel apps were like this oneüëç."
2020,1,New version is awful. It used to be easy and clear to search flights etc. But now its all muddled up. Please go back to the way it was?
2019,5,really user friendly and informative. I trust this app and this is always my first port of call when looking for flights and planning my holidays.
2019,1,New app: poor interface. Too much tapping to get to a screen with times and prices.
2019,1,"New interface is more complex, less user friendly and not not useful at all. Old application was much better than this."
2022,1,"Useful app with cunning partners like My trip and booktogate, which the final price is always 50% higher than their initial low price. Reason given was due to price increase."
2019,1,"What happened to the user interface?? They absolutely ruined it! Not in anyway helpful. Just use the website, way better experience."
2022,4,"Why can't we have the option to search hotels by name ,i have to navigate through a whole selection of hotels rather than just typing the name and looking"
2019,4,Cheaper compared to other apps..no hidden charges..but only thing is they dont provide rates of +- 2 or 3 days in the date chart so we can plan accordingly
2019,5,Over all i'm happy and satified with this app so far. (+vibes) to all who wants to travel around u can find here the price u want at the very affordable price....
2019,5,I don't normally write reviews however I am loving the 'Price Alerts' feature. Saves on constant monitoring of flights etc. Well done Skyscanner team!
2021,1,Please remove edreams.co.uk from booking from india. They dont have local contact or service in india. Ticket charges are shown diffrent and debit more. Dont buy from this. Sky scanner should not allow this kind of blunder.
2019,4,This app actually works & bypasses all those corporate owned sites that send you to the most expensive sites n rates. You have to work at it but can find good rates.
2022,2,Used to be a great tool to find cheap flights throughout the year. Now you only get reasults up to 3 months in advance very dissapointed.
2023,5,I have booked flight from Skyscanner app. The traveling partner is HappyFares. The money got deducted from my account but I have not received any confirmation yet. Can someone look into it asap since i have to travel tomorrow?
2019,5,"Really great app, it shows Actuall price however rest app shows higher amount first and after giving promo code they come to the actual price, I would always prefer this app instead of others as they are making us fool and wasting your time."
2019,1,"As per latest study Skyscanner app is sending user personal data without permission to facebook. They responded to this just by saying ""weren't aware"" üò° Its a privacy nightmare."
2022,3,"the app is good, but their customer care is terrible. they had a provider kiwi who had been robbing customers, upon multiple reports, they had only supported kiwi and continued them to be their supplier."
2019,5,"It doesn't get any better, honestly. These are the cheapest prices you will find, and the app serup is perfect. Thank you! :-)"
2022,2,"Searched ""everywhere"". Options that come up are USA, Bolivia, Albania, and... nothing else. So if your undecided use this app if Albania sounds like a great vacation"
2023,1,It's very bad experience this site they don't cancel if you want to cancel your flight and they don't extend and don't refund if you not travel . So please keep in mind don't book the flight from this site.
2018,5,Comparing to other travel apps this is more useful. It have more options and it will show the time difference in other country where we travel and more.
2022,1,Used to be good. Now is really really bad. Inaccurate results. Difficult to search. Almost pointless using it
2023,1,App says my current location is Kannur international.. im in Australia.. I have deleted and reinstalled and still advises my current location is India. I don't trust this app anymore.
2020,1,"What the hell is this new update?? I tried many apps for flying but this was the best one so I use it from years and I don't wanna find another one instead of the best. Please, improve this asap."
2022,1,"Very risky App if any transaction fails no body will support. No history, no support if anything goes wrong, the vendor is behaving like no relation. Don't use it for purchasing ticket."
2021,1,"This app used to be amazing, now they complicate things and its NON FRIENDLY USER. you want to select the distination and it stick with whatever you had selected before....... usless"
2021,1,"prices are not correct. Providers prices differ substantially (e.g. go to gate, travelup). Also prices escalate if repeatedly search and return to baseline following day!"
2022,5,One of best app for flight booking. I always suggest my friends family to check this app before making any flight booking. I will give this app 6 star if possible. Thanks a lot team
2021,1,Please make it as it was before its suckes as well new update also sucks an How to choose cheap price when it suckes to c also pleas make it as it was before like in 2019 please we beg u an In Price checking option When i click on Option on 13000rs 1 flight other option of less price vanishes what the developer is doing u better paying him less salary I was I could Sent u the Screenshot what happens please solve this issue
2021,2,"They have a partnership with a company called tripair, which is basically has been scamming people since 2020 regarding refunds that never returned to people although airlines have issued refunds to them already along time ago. Tripair never returned any body's money and yet you will find a link to them on every flight search"
2023,1,"Messy and confusing app. I've bought about 10 tickets using this app, but almost half of these were on wrong date. Had to buy ticket once again!"
2018,2,"Prices i the app are higher than prices in skyscanner website in the internet. There is no logic therefore the app is useless for consults, I have to use the website for research and compare prices"
2019,5,Great app thats really simple and straight forward. Gives good filtering options and finds the best flight options too!
2019,4,sometimes it can see the best connection flights & sometimes price on the website is different from an original price. otherwise it's a good app
2019,5,"friendly user. I am not spring chicken nor a computer nerd. this app is so useful, at least to check that prices are high and cheap tickets are ridiculously longüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
2018,5,"One Stop Shop when looking for airline tickets. Found cheap cheap airline tickets to Hawaii and Las Vegas, cheapest I've ever found. Love this app!"
2019,4,"straight forward , easy to use used the app to book flights twice and both times have been easy and stress free."
2019,5,Love this app! It always keeps me updated on what variations my trips have in price and finds the best deals.
2022,3,Nice app Some sites are cheating showing lower price but when you do booking they ping a msg this flight is unbookable or Fare has changed directly to double. Mostly on budgetticket.in
2019,3,"nice app, but i have like 4 possible departure airport near to me, but i cannnot select 4 possible departure /arrival airports for 1 trip. would be more helpful."
2022,3,"You should bring complete screen reader accessibility into the application, so it will help the visually impaired people to book tickets."
2021,1,What happened to this app?! It used to a great and useful app. Now it is full with useless and unsolicited information while it became difficult to search for flight tickets.
2018,3,Good app other than the fact that I can't see whether or not flight is able to be changed or cancelled or whether baggage is included or not. Please fix!
2019,5,handy app with good information availability on changing fare prices. i like their monthly prices option. very simple to use!
2019,5,Such a simple way to get the GREATEST deals on the internet! I love you Skyscanner... You make me feel so smart when quoting travel prices to my friends! And you make purchases easy...
2020,1,What possessed you to remove the option to filter direct flights from the first step when selecting 'everywhere' as a destination?! Strange decision.
2022,1,there is huge price difference but tickets are not getting confirmed. I have get this feedback from my friends and they suggested to book directly from Airlines.
2021,5,"I always find the best pricing here and I like how it tells u the prices for days before u pick them. No other service does that. Kayak was my go to, but this is much better and always cheaper."
2022,4,"It's practical but unfortunately most of the time, the prices shown at the monthly overview don't fit with the actual flight pricesüòï"
2021,3,"It was much better review earlier, the user could see best offers in all dates on screen chart. The preview of all offers was more user friendly."
2022,4,It's a great way to find flights but when you find a flight for added security and consumer rights go to the actual airline and book with them direct and not with one of the cheaper options.
2019,5,I needed something that provides dependable alerts when flights become cheaper. this did just that.
2018,5,"Good and easy peasy to use... For a Price Comparison Site, App all in one holiday tool. Not a trip planner!"
2019,5,This app has saved me many hundreds of euros and probably also many hours of searching for flight tickets. It is easy to use and fast.
2018,3,Crashed 5 times already on samsung s6.Shows cheap flights but as soon as you click into it..The price is far more expensive than initially advertised.please fix
2019,2,"If for instance you travel from A to C with connection in B, the app would rather present more expensive options from the same company than connect two differing companies which would be much cheaper."
2020,1,It's broken! I try to login and it keeps taking me to the sign up page and telling me I have an account already and to sign in! Going around in circles!
2022,5,"I have always found best fares through Skyscanner... and what I appreciate the most is that they keep me posted on rate changes. Thank you, Skyscanner team, for working hard to get best possible options for us!"
2022,1,"Not intuitive, very limited & difficult to search for a flight. Better use the full web"
2019,1,They put all these ridiculous self-transfer flights at the top of my search. Who the heck wants to switch airports to catch a connecting flight!?!
2019,1,booked flight via skyscanner and the original website was a fraud. The price shown at the time of booking was lower than the amount deducted from my account without any notice.
2020,1,What's happened to this app? When planning my routes the days of the flights don't appear anymore. It's impossible to see the dates of the flights and prices. Please fix this.
2022,1,"Skyscanner used to be good, but they slowly have become so bad it's barely usable. I'm on the 4th ticket that gets cancelled after buying it..."
2022,1,"Poor quality app now, used to be a great place to book flights... Now the app has too many issues no ease of use at all! Just uninstalled now and no more gonna use them again."
2022,4,It's a very good application which can be used in any country of the world. I believe it can be expanded to include smaller locality not just big cities. More awareness can be created so that more people can use the application.
2023,3,"App is good but prices in the calendar don't match the real ones, even if you filter by lowest price."
2019,3,Oftenly these guys have deals that too good to be true and it is because it will be marked as sold out once youvey gone through all the trouble of keying in all the particulars. Besides this it's an OK apo
2021,1,Can't believe you did away with seeing the whole month in Graph form its gone from the top right hand corner I use to book on this app just can't be bothered with it now a real dud ..went from a 5 star to a one star
2023,1,"I bought a ticket from skyscanner partner company Flight Network, flight Network charged my debit card but not send me my ticket confirmation. I complained many times but they hadn't send me my ticket confirmation and didn't refund my money as well. They are looters."
2019,5,"easy interface, mirrors the online version. Best way to find good value flights and car rentals (havent used the hotel bookings)"
2020,2,used to be the best app for planning your trip. now it is useless for me without the calendar view. this is the reason for changing my 5 star review
2022,5,This app is exceptionally well. Made my booking experience soo smooth and so easy. Got the best and cheapest flight tickets.
2018,5,"This app has by far the best search engine for finding cheap flight tickets. Highly recommended, found Tickets to Europe from Australia from as low as $1000 AUD"
2019,3,"Probably the best app of it's kind, but price alerts don't observe my filters, plus no support for flexible dates."
2022,1,Worst app ever I have seen. Shows a unrealistic rate and then when u select it then it shows the 3 times hike of the rate
2020,2,Add whole month prices! It's a terrible experience to have to change from day to day to find different prices!
2020,2,"Aap works pretty well, but i booked ticket via Skyscanner, it took me to bravofly, the worst, which seems to be a fraud. No indian contacts working. Skyscanner is nowhere to help me."
2018,1,"Slowed my phone down just by being installed, wouldn't accurately display prices, showed prices HIGHER than a quick google search. Gg app developers."
2019,5,"Easy to use, no limitations for price alerts compared to other apps! OMG! Really love this app, I wish I discovered it as early as I can."
2021,2,This app used to be great but now for some reason it starts searching before you've even entered your search criteria. Please can you revert to the good version?
2019,3,Return the feature that tells you how many days until your trip. This used to be in the trips section but is no longer shown.
2020,1,What the heck happened!!?? Used this all the time and now the layout is horrible...was so easy to use before and now its just too frustrating and going to be deleted.
2021,5,"I love this app. specifically ""anywhere"" feature. it's so amazing that even if you don't have any destination in mind, it will give you so many options."
2019,5,"Awesome App, been using on varios gadgets for years. If not the app, the website as it is a great research tool for flights before booking anything up üëå"
2023,1,Latest flight search option is very stupidity. It's show like package options. Difficulty to find out date
2022,1,"Once I tap on an option to move forward, the screen remains in blank with any detail, if I go back I can see the options again but nothing to select afterwards"
2021,1,"Sadly doesn't show you all options. There's some flight companies that have much cheaper tickets, but are omitted from the results."
2019,3,"I have been using this app for 4 years, the app has change I am uninstalling this app. This used to be my goto site for flight but not anymore the prices are too high."
2022,1,The app is no longer displaying all options. I think it is being blocked and identified as a Bot. Time to find a new app.
2018,5,I love skyscanner because it let's you see when the cheapest flight will be and different dates very easily. It gives you so many excellent choices
2022,3,Please add the option to select 'cheapest month' when searching for flights on this app. It exists on the website but not in the app which makes using the web version better
2019,5,very good App. I've used it for booking flights two times this month and it was able to get me such good deals and everything went well.
2019,1,"Won't be using until they add whole calendar view, which is the most useful setting on the browser site."
2019,1,Very hard to follow price changes and the prices shown are not the most recent prices. So useless.
2023,4,My only issue is the advertised prices are always lower than actual prices when you try and book. Never the same or lower.
2019,1,can look and see the price but when want to book the payment page cannot load properly the expired date of the credit card keep on INVALID DATE... so annoying omg!!!! how to key in valid expired date... what the format!!!!????
2019,1,have had this app for a while but I am now getting reports through the security on my phone and it's to tell me skyscanner is using my camera in the background when my phone is not in use very concerned with the privacy issue now
2019,5,Love this app. i compared it of with other site s and it's accurate with pricing. The best thing is i know of the prices changes before my friends.
2023,4,"fast, easy, and powerful search engine. Search parameter UI could be improved."
2022,2,Worked well until they took away the option to filter flying to & from same airport. Pain in the butt now so I'll be using a different one.
2021,4,Good app but earlier it was highlighting the baggage allowance and aircraft on particular flight but now this information is no longer available. I wished the same must be continued
2019,2,I will change my rating when you add the option to exclude some air companies in a profile. For example I will never use again Ryanair... not even for free!!!
2022,1,"Used it in the past to search for flights across all airlines. It doesn't do that anymore, only the majors. Deleting"
2019,5,"Very easy to use, finds great deals, with a nice layout for a pleasant visual design."
2020,1,Book a flight and Airasia for a friend goind back to Johor.. Sky App system show not specific flight detail.. Try call airasia no number email no reply watsapp no reply.. Went to Klia counter also sd no record.. Payment deducted from my bank acct.. WHAT IS happening demand a refund immediately.. My friend have to buy another ticket back to JB through Klia counter
2019,5,it's an amazing app we can find flight & hotels tickets in cheap cost. it's very useful to me and if you try it would be best for you
2022,1,Fare is just an eyewash !! They show a little fare than any other site but the ticket confirmation will go on hold and you will receive an email saying...The fare ticket you are looking for is sold out and you got to add additional quoted money to get the confirmation of ticket. Orelse your money will be safe and shall be refunded after 10-15 working days.üòäüòé
2021,1,Too many dodgy agent on this website been using this app since long but now it's not same as before. My flight has been cancelled and I have been told by agent will get money back by weekend now already 4 weeks past nothing came
2019,1,"It was fine earlier, nowadays it is not at all showing aprropriate price and when you check the price u ll find an enhanced price, this will hamper the name it earned earlier."
2019,4,easy & accessible app...would be better if lowest rates on the calendar is displayed /shown...lowest rate of the day.
2019,4,Good place to book your flight...few times difficult when language causes problems and a bit difference of rates in final stages of booking...
2023,5,Very good application to search for the best possible airlines as our choices. Easy to operate and very helpful..
2022,1,This app tracks searches and makes the flights more expensive once it knows your looking at a certain destination and time frame .
2018,5,Always have the best luck with skyscanner out of any other travel apps. Very easy to navigate.
2019,1,"Older version crashed when starting, got the newest version also crashed. Please fix because this WAS a 5 star app."
2018,5,"I use this app for all of my flights, it's so helpful in comparing prices and I love getting notifications for price alerts."
2021,1,"Worst interface ever , not easy to chose destinations date , and also the theme color no option for adjusting , your new update ruined it completely üòí"
2019,5,Great app but I wish I could set the granularity of notifications. $1 and $2 price changes don't matter but $20 changes do.
2019,4,Usually can find the best deal for flights. Only thing I am missing is to be able to run a search for more than one departure and arrival airport.
2022,1,I'm extremely frustrated with the fact that it doesn't show the prices. It gives me the cheapest price but doesn't go to the next screen
2019,5,"Great app to find and compare flights, with precise prices and many other websites offered. Great booking experience!! loved it"
2019,5,easy to use and a great starting point. just be aware of their fees include checked bags or not
2018,5,Great Airfare App. üëç much better than others You can save the one you like and monitor price ..... and prices are lower than others Travel Apo. too ‚≠ê üåé ‚≠ê
2019,5,I just started to locate flight destination by price and time I found it very easily. Tnx for Sky scanner.
2023,5,You can filter out Emirates from your results - making it a fantastic application. Seeing options without Emirates polluting the search results is very refreshing
2019,5,Easy to use app and I haven't ever found cheaper flights thru other platforms. It's my go to app to search for flights.
2019,5,As a person that travels alot this is a much need apps. Others apps such as hopper and Google flights don't show as many available tickets as this one
2018,5,Planning multiple trips is a breeze and it even has a price alert feature to informed me of increases or decreases for my particular flight!!
2019,4,"Good little app, doesn't have the full functionality of the full website, but still pretty useful."
2018,1,I proceeded with flight booking with bestjet agent they deceived me as i paid and after they received the money through credit card they replied with no available tickets they paltered with extra fees...i don't trust them anymore
2022,1,very bad. It shows low price in their application and when we book ticket price are increasing so much.
2019,5,An amazing app which helps you plan your travel economically. It gives you route options which you'd normal have to figure out alone
2019,5,very good great deals and very easy to change days in just 2 taps. also remembers your searched airports so you dont have to type em in everytime A+
2021,1,Horrible experience with your site. You have allowed such pathetic travel apps like Goibibo in your portal from which booking cant be made and moreover they are not interested in refunding the money also for a failed transaction. No customer support for it. Please remove it from your portal so that the customers dont fool themselves by making bookings from such pathetic apps.
2021,1,The new layout is terrible. No longer use as searching for things takes twice as long.
2019,5,Gives useful updates on price changes for flights. Easy to sort and search for ideal options l.
2021,1,THIS APP SUCKS!! The new UI/UX sucks. Did you even test this with your user base??? I see there are hundreds of comments with similar feedback. Will you take any action? I'm uninstalling until you fix the UI/UX.
2023,1,Except fpr checking flights rates its worthless to booking cant find any details after we book flights thru this fraud paltform dont book tickets thru this appp its helpcenter also always not available if u try to open it thru this useless app it will keep on loading for years.
2019,1,it's been disappointed when I booked flight with emirates airline at the end I found oprated by fly dubai I didn't understand why I pay more money than fly dubai now I'm stuck trying to change travelling date no option to change when I'm calling fly dubai office no one is taking responsibility still I'm trying to call emirates airline it's same and dear Skyscanner when you email someone please send reservation number or refrance number not only ticket I'D please
2019,4,Feedback! Suddenly my saved flights will disappear randomly even if I have saved them just recently... Please fix the bug !
2019,4,Crashes a lot. Exits without giving desired information. It seems the issue it is linked to the facebook SSO.
2018,4,Great summaries of available flights. Love the way it rates the choices based on price and duration.
2018,5,"The hap help to find the cost of tickets, but sometimes the websites donot provide right information and while you try to book a flight the actual fare is much higher then what is displayed in this app."
2019,5,brilliant app especially now got the low cost airlines that people actually use. great filters for leave / arrive time requirements. well done
2019,1,Ticket prices are very close to expedia ($1 cheaper in my flight from US to UK) but the same upgrade on expedia priced at $140 costs $400+ on this app.
2019,5,easy to use when filters are set. great that can add an alert for fare prices.
2022,1,"hi, please don't go for this..it will show less price compared to other, once you booked a tickets, you will not get any mail confirmation with PNR....later u will receive a call from concerned company customer care as..stated that sorry we are unable to booked your tickets due to dynamic price ..now you needs to pay some extra amount for the final booking..they all are playing and manipulating like this...worst experience had ever..."
2022,1,Your App is extremely slow . I was searching for flight but not able to do so . Because always crash crash so now I am uninstalling
2023,1,App is rubbish flights to everywhere say price is one thing but when search the prices are double. Rubbish UX.
2019,2,It has crashed aftet I was using it for 2 months. I am reinstalling it again and giving it another chance since I liked it in the past.
2021,2,"Many flaws to the app, such as the inability to not search only for direct flights. A missed opportunity."
2019,5,very convenient to identify cheaoer tickets in such small time.. hioe they add a feature to help identify cheapest time to travel too :D
2019,5,Great app! Very easy to use and I found MUCH BETTER deals here then on any other travel app or website! I would definitely recommend!
2019,2,"Doesn't sync watchlist between devices. Sponser ad, in Skyscanner app, pointed me to a better app."
2023,1,Why only two to three providers are providing cheaper rates and these providers are also have very low ratings .We as customers can't believe on these providers inspite these providers are giving cheaper rates u should maintain quality we dont need cheaper rates at the cost of fraud or fakeness we always opt for another options inspite skyscanner is providing cheaper rates and when we go through the reviews some customers also told when we proceed for ticket confirmation price goes high .
2019,4,Very useful app and the alert button a excellent way to keep track of cheaper flights.
2019,5,Really good for narrowing on all possible flights at a cheeper rate. They also warn you about long layovers and other flight tidbits
2022,3,I requested to change flight date so they request extra fee then I paid but they said fare is change and I have to pay other extra as new ticket and they refuse refund option. Not Recommend
2019,5,I love how easy this app is to use. It has the best overall prices and easy to adjust dates to find the best option for anyone.
2020,2,The search function is now very convoluted. Can't find the cabin options. Not a great update.
2019,1,Kayak app is way better. Really love Skyscanner but not this app! Difficult to use and it's not easy to find the best deals
2018,2,The prices should be updated very frequently and need to add suggested dates feature for lowest fare. Also needed the date wise exact prices for roundtrip flights.
2021,1,The new app is simply horrible. Can we please go back to the old one? This is so confusing and complicated compare to the old version.
2022,5,"cheap flights provided, excellent app.We can go this app without any hesitation,it is provided through many other apps like make my trip etc."
2022,5,"High speed, Convenient, Flexible, Timely & User friendly app I can recommend to any air traveller."
2021,5,"very easy to use, and you can set up cost updates for specific flight paths. cannot complain"
2019,5,Superb. it's easy to navigate through the app to get planning and bookings done.
2022,1,"Fake tactics to make downloads , they will always show you cheapest flights at first and within seconds will show that particular flight increased the rates to 4000-5000 rs so I hate this app. Going to delete now."
2020,1,"Nonsense app , I choose fly with ¬£470 both ways for one person but after searching the price rise to ¬£750 !!! The app don't work !!"
2018,5,Just perfect ! Never found cheaper Flights on another app ! We booked flights from Germany to Bali Bangkok and Australia here. Never had problems
2022,1,"Lousy app.I search multi city flights.Go to Vienna,back fr Zurich.After I save the flights,it become Vienna round trip!!I tried to many times..this stupid just keep changing my saved flight details!!"
2022,3,"not great anymore. prices scanned are not always correct, also filters are not advanced as it could be"
2023,5,great app n great price but they should also include an option to exclude transit or connecting flight from particular countries
2018,4,"use this app a lot!! just great. just don't understand why you can not select ""whole month"" in the app but only on the site ü§î i miss this option so use more the site"
2018,1,This was the only app I used to use to book flight. Now it displays only inexistent flights. A huge disappointment.
2023,5,Good app for comparing overall price from all platforms. A best option for booking flights and hotels with good discounts.
2019,5,nice app that consolidates prices from multiple carriers and always gives best rate and best routes. I love it.
2019,2,lacking whole month view so hard to find best deal. Have to resort back to laptop for better options.
2019,5,"easy to use, alerts on price changes, inventive ways to find trip destinations. 10/10"
2019,5,"Excellent app, very practical, easy to navigate, intuitive and esthetically pleasing"
2021,4,One of the best places to find flights and hotels for reasonable prices. The app is easy to use and simple to navigate.
2022,1,Frequent errors when trying to apply filters for flight searches. Errors...errors again! Ridiculous app :(
2019,4,The first place I go to look for flights. The only downside is that the prices indicated does not take into account 3rd party site additional cost
2019,5,"Fantastic aggregator, really trawls them offers. Interface is very easy to use."
2020,1,I am loosing my faith in Skyscanner because I have been observing that third party vendors playing DIRTY price game with us. For e.g. on result page you find Flight ticket of $100 and as soon as you enter into 3rd party site either prices may go upto $150 or Seats unavailable and been forced to buy costly tickets...
2020,1,Skyscanner will direct you to some unknown very shady companies. They often offer tickets for flights that have already cancelled many days earlier. Good luck getting your money back.
2019,3,"Lack of option to show airport nearby is not good, especially when your website have it."
2023,1,"When your search results are shown in the calendar , the prices shown on the calendar days do not exist for booking."
2019,5,I am using this app for finding cheap flights. It's very user friendly and I never had any problems. I can recommend to use it.
2020,1,"Awful app, I can't log in into my account where I booked my flights by Skyscanner and I can't even change my flight. How to contact customer service by app.?!!"
2019,4,Very useful. Would give 5 stars if there's an option to look for cheapest fares in 1-3 months
2022,4,"Good for quick search, but should include the filter option to avoid stopovers in US/Canada."
2019,5,Excellent fast way to track and gives you extra info of places and what to do around.
2019,4,Total easy user friendly App. I will continue to use this App. As Time tells all. Thank you Skyscanner Team for this convenient Flight Booking üåà
2023,1,"They often provide prices or tickets that no longer exist. They also do not screen the reservation agencies so be careful about stumbling into a bad one, e.g. jetabroad"
2020,4,You cannot set the same in and out bound airport like on the website which makes searching somewhat challenging.
2020,1,OMG. What have you done to the app. No nearby airport search. Whole layout is way harder to compare flights. Sack your app developers now. üëé
2019,5,So much easier than the websites of some airlines. Also saves time manually comparing them all
2018,5,I've used this app for 99% of my trips and I travel a lot! So useful and so quick and very clear on prices etc.
2023,5,very easy and comfortable app for booking anything from an hotel to a trip. very recommended and i am enjoying using the app.
2018,4,Cookies are a bit of a pain in the a and make difficult searching for different destinations one after another.
2022,1,This app is made to scam you they show you cheap price and attract because they are looting most of the other customers and I guarantee they will not contact you if you have any query or issue which u want to get resolved. i was fooled and my money was stolen by these people. Also will be reporting this app.
2021,3,good app for searching.. but I think the browser works way better. Too many errors and bugs.
2019,1,Used to love this app but since the latest update I'm not able to see my watchlist with every flight i had saved to check them later...pls get back to the previous version...
2019,1,They just removed the best option with the last update! üëøüëøüëø We can't see prices for the whole months at one anymore! Skyscanner you sucks!!
2018,3,Not happy with the most recent update. They removed the homescreen widget function.
2019,3,Disappointed with the lastest update I can't find the multi city option which was very convenient and easy to use !!
2022,5,Skyscanner is the best in its pricing. U get everything what ur looking for with no extra charges.
2023,2,Cannot filter airlines! Very hassle. I filtered airlines of my choice but it still shows the airlines i don't prefer in the result.
2019,4,Very good app but needs improvements to be considered excellent. To start with how about adding the Airlines Alliance Grouping function?
2019,5,A very good app but sometimes under explore feature fares shown do not match with final rates.
2019,5,"Really enjoed using this app, after checking all the other sites this app gave me deals I couldnt find on any other website. The app works, looks nice and is easy to use."
2021,1,I'm searching for a flight and like Qatar Airways. On their website they have a flight but excluded from your search results. Still same problem. Do airlines have to pay to be listed?
2022,5,"Makes it easy to find flights and cars, and finds the absolute best prices. What more could you want?! Love it."
2019,5,Always good experience. I've booked my last 3 flights on it .hoping to get my cheapest flight back to tasmania on here too
2022,1,"very disappointed booking with gotogate, first and last time to book through...no accuracy in details and total amount of money is different from what you pay...I paid more than what is mentioned....be careful of GotoGate provider...no transparency at all"
2019,3,i book my flights with the airline direct. is good app to look @ different prices. only am flying blue member so i do more benefits if i book with the airline.
2023,1,Useless now. It shows the price based on earlier data. Actual price may differ by 3 folds
2019,4,Works quite well. Always room for improvement (expedited purchasing through arrangements with major travel booking firms would be wonderful)
2020,1,"Go back to the old lay out please, this new version is horrendous to use! Used to be a great app. Google flights is easier than this rubbish!"
2018,4,"Easy to use, no hassles with unwanted info. Short sharp and straight to point."
2018,2,"I downloaded it because I saw an offer for train tickets but keep getting a notification when applying the code that I'm not a first time user, although I've never used it before"
2022,1,Can't seem to set parameters relevant to my travel plans prior to search...so too much time wasted going through the results after. Deleted
2023,1,Unable to complete profile setting. Getting nowhere trying to find the flights I have previously selected to track prices.
2019,2,It's a good app but can't put the amount of people travelling..it's annoying. I have uninstalled heaps of times
2022,2,"The app would be ok but useless for planning, because it doesn't allow to copy text or flight information or to forward and share your flight info to email"
2021,1,They have deleted useful features of the app. I can not search for a cheap flight on a month.
2019,1,"Terrible. Just installed on android and doesn't work! Tried booking a flight several times, nothing, blocked. Useless"
2020,1,Updated the app over night. Now I can only check for economy flights. No option to change class. I've tried everything
2022,1,App doesn't provide sufficient flexibility with date departures when searching. I prefer the web version.
2019,3,"App struggles to pick up locations based on abbreviations, so then the search fails. Mobile browser is more reliable"
2021,1,This app sucks! I tried so many times to save a Flight and a Trip and there aren't any save buttons or links do how do tell do you SAVE anything in this app? Garbage!
2019,5,"So simple, convenient and fast to check on flights. The fly to 'anywhere' option is our fav."
2021,1,I used to love this when I could scan for the best price over the span of a few months. Now that I can't do that I will not be using this app again. I can do what they're offering with other apps
2023,2,it used to be much more reliable and accurate about flights and prices. Not anymore! Very disappointing...
2019,4,Offers you flights with cheapest price and best quality but the problem is that it's not easy to find round trip flight with different routes and stops
2021,1,"Credit/debit payment ‚Ç¨75 additional, can't understand that why? Too much to add on.too much to know, when you trying booked a flight. Is getting definitely worse üòÖ?"
2022,1,"Your app doesn't allow for booking with infants at the same rate as 2 ppl how stupid, just another money grab with no value added. Better of using Expedia"
2018,5,Love love love this app. Been using it for years now and only use this site to find the best flight prices including budget airlines.
2019,5,"It's our regular app for flight searches and bookings for several years. easy, accurate and reliable."
2018,5,"Easy to search app, very nice, data management is also very good, cheaper rates."
2022,5,i always use this application to find the cheapest flights and most of the times I get the best rates however just make sure that the flight that you take is not a multiple route flight
2023,2,"Cannot easily see options for regional alternatives or flexible prices, even though I chose the monthly option. Prices don't appear"
2019,4,its very useful and easy to navigate application. always best options available.
2020,2,"Terrible, while is travelup using small price to lure people, then when you tried to book it's kept coming up as flight not available, This fraud."
2019,5,"good price alert, but please add one more option in which we can select only drop price not the higher than actual selected time."
2021,5,This is a great site for flight discounts and I love the option that allows you to search a variety of cities and countries at once.
2019,1,Uninstalled in 30 seconds Why when your website is very usable can you not design a user friendly app ? Even worse than your last app. Back to using the website.
2023,1,Purchased Ticket and cancelled it .. but no refund ... Pls be careful they don't keep and record but take your money ... Why are they only allowed to operate in the first place . Its all fraud
2019,1,"I am looking for flights, not to be upsold holiday packages, but unfortunately Skyscanner doesn't seem to be a good place to get flights anymore."
2021,1,"Congrats for screwing up the clean old search interface rendering your app completely useless. Astonishing job, really. Uninstall."
2019,5,"If you're looking for cheap flights, this app is all u need. It makes booking flights easy!"
2022,1,"Have been using Skyscanner for a while now but given that they have started redirecting to unscrupulous providers like Opodo, I will have to figure out a better way of booking flights"
2021,1,"You need to read the horrible reviews and change back to your old, better setup or else expect to continue seeing terrible reviews. This isn't rocket science here. Everyone hates the changes, so listen to them."
2019,1,"The new logo is disgusting, please revert asap. I loved this app until you changed the logo, planning to use other apps from now on unless you revert."
2019,4,"Instantly display the optimal combination of flight ticket prices, which is really awesome!!!!"
2018,5,Great user interface. Super basic and easy. Don't change!
2022,4,Great app. Filters all available options to find the most economical flight path or cheap hotel stay.
2019,5,Easy to Use..! and getting for a good deal and also u can see the prices of the different airlines in same time..!
2019,5,"Great app! Works very well, almost no ads, really usefull for planning your trips by air and booking plane tickets!"
2019,1,I would prefer website over app as the app hangs a lot and everhtime you restart you have to start from begining..once it stopped while i was making payment..
2021,1,Used to be good now it's Absolutely disgusting. Uninstall this app if you made my same mistake. Got redirect to a scam website through this app. Now I'm fighting to get my money back.
2019,1,"How come the calendar is not correct??? like June 18,2019 is a Tuesday. But in this app, June 18,2019 is a Sunday! is there a way to adjust this????"
2022,3,Unable to select nearby airports function which is on the internet version. Very handy in widening search parameters
2019,4,"I have not use the app yet to bye my ticket however, I wish to find low price of ticket soon. I am receiving daily email on the price."
2018,5,This should be the first place to look at the prices of airline tickets when you want to go anywhere. Simply love how it works. Definitely recommend it.
2023,1,"Chinese app. Everything is written in English AND Chinese. Support local apps, not from countries where there are dictators."
2023,5,excellent gives instantly prices of all categories. which is very useful for deciding.
2021,4,Old interface was good. Selecting from to in the current setting is a bit confusing
2018,3,I can't find price alert button. Already Googled. It should be next to search button. But it's not there.
2019,1,"Searched for flights from LGW to Malmo, Sweden. Results show many different airports for my origin here in the UK. And it's multiple airports for origin for the same return flight, meaning it shows, for example, the flight leaves from LHR to Malmo, then return is Malmo to Stanstead. Insane. If I search for LGW it should ONLY show flights from and to LGW."
2019,1,Updated app and now keeps crashing. Too bad because this is how I always book my trips. I guess I have to try a new app now.
2021,5,I I have never had any problems with this app or the companies associated with it. The flights have always been available as described
2018,5,"Wonderful, calming, and fantastic flight info and options. I travel a lot and I use it every time."
2019,5,"I haven't used it so often, but it seems that they did an upgrade and last week when I used it I really loved the user experience. Well done!"
2019,3,The departure/arrival time filters are unidirectional and extremely annoying.
2019,1,The app recorded 49 second video in the background of my phone - removed app. There was no reason why this should be recording videos
2020,1,"It's not the skyscanner which it used to be, store cookies and increase the fair, store our data and share with 3rd parties, why do you want to store our data with you? Your job is to just list down the flights,its damn slow you need to your work the performance of the aap"
2021,2,They ruined the App. Before the last update it was amazing. It is very difficult and confusing to search for a flight now.
2022,2,"after providing all the details like dates... the app does whatever it wants anyway... pure rubbish, but won't forget to try and sell you even a donkey, if it is for sale..."
2022,2,They up the prices after you searching flights. So annoying. Try to book from other people's devices
2021,1,what the hell did you do to this app?! I used it years ago. it was so simple and user friendly. Now it's not. I can't even change the starting airport.
2019,5,You can find the flights that you preferred(price & destinations). Is easy to use!!
2023,1,Oops something went wrong.... We cannot complete your search. Happens about 60% of the time while searching. Have to wait a few hours and try again later
2020,5,"This app is the best I have come across in this genre. Does what it is supposed to, without bugs and provides real time good information."
2019,5,"well made app, intuitive and really helpful. to recommend 2 app flight-fares related, would be momondo and skyscanner"
2022,5,"Best app in the world for finding flights, been using it for all my flights for nearly 15 years. highly recommended!"
2019,5,Best site for flights and holidays by far in my mind tried them all.No hidden secrets. The go to site if you wont a last minute holiday . Five star plus.
2019,1,I am unable to find the show whole month icon. Previously the show whole month icon was available showing the estimated fares of the whole month. But now cant find it
2022,1,"Application is continuously showing status of ""installing"" in ply store since last 12 - 13 hours. I tried to cancelled it many time but play store got hang."
2021,1,"No option to select where flying to. Selected Melbourne but there is no where to select destination, in this case Hobart for June 2021"
2019,5,i love this app. It is easy to use . However I would like that the app suggest you places to visit based on price range. Thank you
2019,5,Best way to book or ticket and plan you drem vacation. The new explore feature is awesome.
2020,1,Used to be my wife and I's go-to service for finding flights but it has become messy and seems to have lost functionality with a recent update
2023,2,Used the app for years because it's so good. But now it's pretty poor - you can't clear your last trip to investigate another.
2021,3,"It shows me prices of the currency of the country I am in, not the curency I use and think in. Therefore this app is completely, utterly, functionally useless."
2022,1,Used to to be great. Used to show you prices for each date which you could quickly match up. Resetting your dates is a real hassle now üëéüèª
2021,2,the price given is the absolute lowest. if you want luggage or status recognised then there's hidden charges after you go to purchase the flights.
2019,5,"This is my favourite go to travel app, have tried most others can't beat Skyscanner. Easy to use and consistently beat other apps."
2019,1,I need to get in touch with you guys. i just booked a flight and did not receive any confirmation. my money is deducted and i just called the airline company they confirmed that they did not receive any booking. i booked a flight from Mumbai to Kochi
2021,1,What have you done. Don't think I have ever seen an app take as many steps backwards. Absolutely shocking. Useless app now. Fire the UX team. Pretty unusable and useless
2019,5,super easy to use . the best prices in all of the apps skyscanner stays the best . super happy with the service ... will always use it for any of my flight reservation
2021,1,They new update sucks. I want back the price range chart so i can select the flight i want easily. Until that happens i rate the lowest
2018,5,"I love this app, very nice interface and easy to use. Helps me alot to find the best flight and compare different options"
2021,1,"Hello, I don't know how most of the teams think, but whoever said that the monthly view should be removed or moved should be fired. why would you take out the only feature being used by everyone? and the new interface is horrible ! using the last update btw (12/01/2021). 1 star and uninstalled."
2019,5,very good app. no problem to book my flights. I've never booked holiday but i have booked flights before. very accurate
2019,5,Booked loads of flights through it - love it! The 'Fly me anywhere' feature has led to me visiting places I never thought I would!!! üòÅ
2018,4,It would be good if they manage to compare like for like prices. Many sites/airlines promote unrealistic base prices and lots of Mandatory costs are excluded which u see at checkout
2019,4,It's great. Aggregates prices from almost all sources. I give it 4 stars - the 1 star missing is due to the few sources it does not aggregate from.
2020,1,The last update is very bad .. flexible dates chart not exist anymore ..so annoying and the app being same the other apps
2018,5,Probably the best app out there. Found the best deals to the most exotic destinations ever. Thumbs up
2018,5,"Great app, fast, accurate, hidden rates. Much more reliable than Kayak and Expedia."
2022,1,"When I go to look for flights in August, it only shows flights up until March. The line along the LHS suggests it should keep scrolling to later dates, but I can't scroll down"
2018,4,Its simply the BEST. No need to check different websites. I am very glad and sincere Thanks to the owner/owners of this App. all the BEST to all of THEM. With BEST WISHES.
2020,1,"Used to be so simple to navigate and see flight prices different costs on different days, luggage allowance etc. Now its a pile of steaming üí©"
2022,1,looks like scams every time I try to pay it gets higher and so many add and services that take so many times also the feedback is fake.
2021,2,App navigation changed for the worse. Now you need more steps to do the same thing as before with flight finder.
2020,1,"Unreliable app, shows only expensive flights , you can find tickets way cheaper on other websites, don't book through here!!"
2023,5,Wonderful app for lowest airfares.
2019,5,"Excellent offering, uncluttered, quick and user friendly. Best I've used to date."
2019,2,"It is showing flights, but when I click on them it says there are not enough tickets. Then don't show them and waste my time."
2022,1,It's a fake app i paid 5641 for flight booking but payment cuts they get but not booked my flight and they eat my money too much fake app this is really i will do case on this application in cyber crime soon.
2019,2,I've been using this app for long time. But now i found they don't search anymore in low costs like Jet Smart. And i bought tickets in another airline loosing money
2019,1,Had a trip planned for 300$ checked a few mins later to book it and the price almost doubled. Sure that wasnt some scare tactic at all. Thanks
2019,5,Easy to use. You can see a lot of different flight options without having to visit a bunch of websites.
2023,1,WARNING! NEVER EVER USE THIS APP YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO LOOSE YOUR MONEY.....i booked a flight ticket for 9 paz from bagdogra to mumbai on 28 jan but after the amount getting deducted the fair rose and the page asked for more money stating an increase in fare then the page got cancelled.... There is no customer care to contact and you will have no nimber to call.... You will be left high and dry
2021,5,"this is the best app ever to plan your trips. whatever your style of travel - fastest, luxury, cheapest, business the search just gets it."
2022,1,"Used to be good. Now shows no results anywhere. Cleared cookies, Reinstalled, same issue!!!!"
2019,5,"I've been using this app for 6 years now. I love it. I find it more competitive for flights outside the US, especially within the EU."
2018,5,"Love it! Its accurate, shows me flight options, transit time, flight hrs and price! üòÑ"
2021,3,"Finally you listen to us and bring back the old interphase, but can you please add the type of plane used in the flight? For me is really important."
2021,5,No double it's very helpful for book tickets on best price. I have booked that's why i am writing here. You will get best price.
2019,4,Don't Collect/Share My Data. I really like this app but since there is no opt out option with collecting/sharing my data it's time for me to go.
2022,1,"Too bad . I booked a flight, which I canceled within less than 22 hours .and still they deducted 146 USD $ from the refundüò™üòî complete fraud behavior"
2022,1,"I have booked a ticket and paid the ticket price, the after two days they send me an email that the rate is not available and the will refund the amount in 5 to 10 days . The same casued financial loss ."
2020,1,Clunky. Limited search options compared to ordinary browser version of website. More interested in trying to sell hotels to you. Walked away went elsewhere.
2022,5,it's always been my most dependable App for flight comparisons. Easy to use with no much advertising strings attached.
2019,4,Super helpful app! I have been using Sky scanner for a few years now as it is a really helpful tool when booking flights.
2019,4,"It's fast and reliable. I got my ticket 10 minutes after I book my flight. but they should have put here the ""Add bagage"""
2019,1,"it's scumskanner, I'm checking price on skyscanner and directly by airlines,the same dates and flights and airlines....3900$ on skyscanner and 900$ directly by Emirates.... no words 3000$ different!!!!"
2020,1,It was my favorite app to find flights till the NEW interface. Very complicated all on this new one... Completely disappointed
2019,5,love this app!!! The lowest prices!! easy to navigate and I love the notifications if the price lowers!
2021,1,"This is bad and a fraud app. I have booked my flight ticket ,but it has been cancelled.And they didnt paid back/ refunded my money yet and this happend to four of my friends too"
2019,5,"Good range of fares, easy to use & does seem to show everything without Mark ups."
2021,1,"Price showing on this app is not even 1% correct. It's fake, fake etc. It's not all about showing cheap fare. It's about showing genuine fare."
2022,1,Very bad website and app. The options showed are not even working. You would not be able to book the flight tickets what a scam
2020,1,"None of the flights shown are available through this app or website, they all lead to broken links. Total Waste of my time"
2021,1,terrible update. spent 20 min to find how to change them one-way search. couldn't find how to s arch best price in a month at all. deleting.
2021,5,They should not list the booking by agencies which have done more fraud cases. It will be a favor to customers. This is very good app.
2019,1,"Used to be a great, straightforward app, but with every update it seems to move away from that."
2019,4,"The site has enough options to choose from, so it helps with your budget. It is first place I come when travelling"
2021,1,The latest 'upgrade' is a dramatic 'downgrade' - PLEASE reinstate the previous version. The new version is just awful.
2019,5,Best deals with accurate results - skyscanners is where I go to whenever I have to plan travel. Gives me best deal options.
2019,5,"Easy app to navigate. Will see the trip planner works, then of coarse see how the trip actually goes."
2021,1,Use this app Only to scan. Not booking It takes much fees. They took 150 Gp for three Tickets which made my Tickets more expensive than the airline site itself whole they gave me less price for the ticket when I scanned.
2019,3,"Some among the suggested by Skyscanner are fraudulent. Be cautious. Recheck the reviews of such sites and book. If u book through Skyscanner, refunds will be bit tougher to get."
2019,5,this is best way to find flights any were in tthe world.. Hassle free best prices..I have been using Skyscanner for many years..for both internal and international flights.. Can't be beaten..üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏
2019,5,Great app for searching flights. doesn't lag or crash even if you have an older phone.
2021,5,Nice app reacts swiftly. Some providers do not show final price. When flights better buy directly at the airlines. App is recommended.
2018,4,Very useful for travel planning and bookings. One of the best option available
2023,1,Web browser version is better.
2021,1,"bad experience, only one of the highest rates i can see on the app, and not even the cheapest shown, had to go literally on airline website to compare and my oh my, this is awful."
2018,1,Urggh. Rubbish. Their website is so easy. Their app is complicated. Can't easily find cheap flights. Sadly useless
2019,5,"Fetches true lowest fare and doesn't add bank's convenience fee either while paying through NetBanking. Simple, fast and trustworthy."
2019,1,The quote they give is $100 more for the same flight on orbitz or Expedia. I would be cautious trusting this app as finding the lowest price
2022,1,Fake site. Don't get into the trap. Also on reels many people are promoting this website to book flights hotel. Don't believe them. It's totally fake one.
2020,1,Became totally unusable... For a flight reservation it's looking from the hague and returning nothing of cause!!! And couldn't find a way to change departure location ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
2022,5,Thanks a lot SKycanner!! I had a problem with cancelation but Skycanner came right away. Problem solved. Thank you folks.
2018,5,"It's very useful, and much faster than website. I could find my flight that i want very quickly with affordable price:)) thanks!!"
2019,5,I love This app. I've been booking my flights thru this app since I started travelling 2 years back. Been recommending this to my. Friends and acquaintances
2019,5,"very user friendly. good filtering of airlines, airports, etc.. like the alerts for flights previously researched whether the price is +/-"
2020,2,"I have to sign in multiple times to access my account. Then, even though my account says US dollars, it prices everything in British pounds Sterling."
2019,4,"for every travel in the world,but it be little better if they had service for transport for every destinations you should travel in the world"
2022,1,"The app hasn't warned me about dangers of booking with kiwi, that does terrible job and messes up plans, losing money and time Strongly recommend to be cautious when booking"
2019,5,I love the flexibility this app gives you to find the best prices on various dates. I also use it in my desktop
2023,5,You can get the cheapest price and best option.
2023,1,Very very bad app. Ticket not booking after successful payment transaction. Also helpline no. Responding earlier.
2018,1,I did a search and was referred to a third party site ezdreams but they showed 9 tickets available but I could not book. When I called them they said there were no tickets left. Please remove them from your search as they are dishonest
2019,4,"Good, sometimes they have really good offers Just hate the fact that sometimes when you Nooka. Flight it send you to different websites not Skyscanner."
2020,1,Programming error. It only offers flights and have no choice to see the hotel and rent a car option. Agreed with Jon March's comment below.
2019,1,You may get a cheap flight but with them using very dodgy third party sites you will most likely get screwed over in the process better to use a real app like kayak or cheapoair
2019,5,have to say its the best app on the web for travel booking for a holiday or on bussness get's you the best prices and fast and very sinple app to use i recommen to every one 100% i must have app for travlers
2021,1,Very bed experience....i booked my ticket from skyscanner.....and they deducted my money after that....i didn't received my flight ticket...i need a souluation please suggest
2020,1,"Used to be an amazing app with the perfect calendar view, now no prices shown and much harder to use"
2023,1,I booked through the app jist now and I lost money but I did not get booking confirmation. And it says book price is higher than the previous... What should I do. I lost money
2019,4,"Always helps me find the best fares. From New Zealand to Perth to Bali, Perth to the Philippines. Love the app. ü¶Ñüòä"
2019,5,"Very good app. There is a bug when I change currency, the currency symbol change but the price didn't."
2018,5,Very cheap price than another apps. Many time i bought an airline tickets from this apps. Great apps. Thanks skyscanner team.
2023,1,"The tag line of this application is that they help travelers to book budget friendly hotels, airline tickets. But this app is not showing any budget friendly hotels... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2019,5,Absolutely fabulous app to plan a trip. Gives all the needed info and is very user friendly too!
2021,1,"This new app is awfull, please please revert to the previous app it was so much better and easier to find future flights with the sliding month to month."
2023,5,"Skyscanner is very good app,gives different choices for booking tickets, hotels etc I recommend it for the people as it is the best app."
2022,1,Blamed seveveral reasons why they needed 80$ more.All could be verified I did correctly and tried to contact them to rectify situation to no aval.DONT USE THUS APP SCAMMERS !!!! THIEF !! I PAID FOR TICKET GOT CO # ETC TOOK MY$ THEN YOU SAYIM NOT BOOKED THIEFS
2018,4,"Good app to search flights,; however, some airlines are excluded that limits your search with included airlines. Keep this in mind."
2022,1,This is very fraud booking app Please don't book from this site Because we have faced so much newsense from customer care That our amount was deducted two times for a ticket that they are not cancelled my ticket and not refunded my amount So requesting you people pls beware before booking
2022,1,Getting worse all the time. Now you type in Dubai and you can choose from two identical Dubai options...
2019,5,"good app. pretty accurate on prices, crashes sometimes, but overall great experience."
2018,5,The best app with the very best flight comparison and price lists. App functions great and trust them all the time.
2021,1,"Can't use this app anymore due to the new version which is very strange, difficult and messy to be used. Do NOT download!"
2023,5,Good app to track cheap fare
2019,5,Skyscanner is my go to! I have found affordable prices to travel international & domestic. Skyscanner has been treating me well.
2019,5,never disappointed when looking for flight even in the last minute time. Always provide the cheaper price compare other website
2018,5,Easy to use and gives a snapshot of flights prices. Also love the colour coding so you can select the dates to get cheaper flights
2019,2,"Very disappointed with the removal of ""multycity"" option. It was very useful. I hope it will be back"
2019,1,It doesn't give an information when the prices fall. It only gives information when the prices has increased. This is so annoying.
2019,1,No option for cheapest month and lacking interface/ navigation . The website is awesome tho
2019,5,the best app for finding best flights. I'm using it for good few years and very happy. thanks and keep up the great service
2019,5,Haven't beat this app with my own research so I trust it. I like the price change alerts on dabbed searches.
2021,1,the new search interface is awful! so irritating when set dates or modify it...
2023,5,"Experience was great traveling with this service r. The rates were affordable, driver was good, and the overall experience was also awesome."
2019,5,easy to use comprehensive results easy to sort and filter with essential options provided
2019,5,Great and very user-friendly app. A must for anybody who travels on a budget.
2019,5,just with internet and skype credit. you can call overseas cheap. without international roaming on your own country simcard. even when you are overseas
2020,1,Can't choose multi city departure/arrival points on the app like you can on the website I mean preferred departure airport ie select bhx but include nearby airports
2019,5,Very useful app. It makes it easier to look for cheaper flight options
2023,5,One of the Bestt apps i have ever seen. Flight ticket in spicejet app was ~5000 Same flight ticket in goibibo was ~3700 Best part same flight ticket booked through sky scanner at ~2500
2019,3,Is there a way to do flight search that AVOIDS USA? Flying or transiting through USA is a Major inconvenience to some travellers because of the Transit visa issue.
2019,1,"The last update is confusing and takes longer to enter all information again every time you seek flights, you really messed up a great application."
2019,5,"So easy, extremely useful and terribly addictive for a traveller such as myself!! Awesome app couldn't ask for better!!"
2023,1,Very poor and cheating on the edge as price for the exacr same destination are different between the web app and the phone app....
2023,1,Why can't I choose to filter ONLY direct flights BEFORE I search for a date to fly? I have a Samsung but my friend who has an Apple can do this. It seems crazy!
2023,1,Bad freezeing web pages
2023,2,Google said this was the best but i found cheaper flights else where. No i dont want to contact anyone. No feedback needed
2022,1,"Application is very good to use, the reason why I am giving 1 star because frequently I am getting human verification windows which is very annoying."
2019,5,"Easy to use fast search and scan. Local and international flights details .And"""" thank you very much """
2020,5,"Fast, easy and informative with a user-friendly interface. Never had any problems."
2022,5,"does exactly what it says. finds flights from many reputable sites. although there are times where there is a difference, but it's still better than nothing"
2019,3,"Really good app, but needs some improvements for a better User Experience like to be more responsive and better filtered results"
2019,1,"Now a days it started to crash like anything, literally my phone get stuck when I am trying to use sky scanner, it never happened before, very much disappointed"
2022,3,"Ok. But small irritating bugs, like showing weeks starting from Sunday, with no option to reset it to a global norm."
2019,4,"its good to compare flight tickets, but sone of the booking sites are not good. pl. put goid ,trusted booking sites."
2022,4,Don't use provider as budget ticket..Initially it has shown less amount but its increasing the cost after payment so we need to pay extra amount.
2021,5,Is this good app for searching a flight? Because I wanna book a flight in this app.please let me know who experienced it. Badly need your feedbacks. Thank you
2022,5,Better than Hoppers ridiculous app. If you lose a phone or sim. With Hopper you are screwed. So it's this app for me for future.
2023,5,Excellent app. Does what it says
2019,5,"Wow! I don't know where I've been, but what a great app! Great UI design, and this app is so much faster than any other aggregator I've used."
2019,5,great deals! auto tracking of discounts. easy to use and understand.
2022,1,"If you search incognito you'll receive cheaper, better deals. I could have saved more than 150 dollars if I knew that. This company has lost their trustworthiness."
2019,1,Skyscanner uses Exploretrip a fraudulent company therefore Skyscanner must be a fraud too. Exploretrip took my flight money and canceled my trip with no refund. SCAM ALERT: BUYER BEWARE
2019,5,very helpful in finding and booking the most affordable flights! also very user friendly!
2022,2,I used to use the app all the time but now it seems the prices shown are rarely right and are much lower than the true costs.
2021,1,"was good before, you could do an open search. now changed so you need to define journey. garbage now, uninstalled."
2023,1,Air ticket Booking hand Luggage how much Cabin luggage bag how much please add
2019,4,"Very useful app but I can't find the ""add nearby airports"" option that is available on the Web version."
2018,5,The best app for find cheapest flights. They give a lot of options. Love it!!!!
2023,1,I feel you advertise fake fares then say they are no.longer there.
2018,5,The prices I got with this app are unbelievably low. For some of the flights I have payed more for the taxi to the airport!
2023,5,good app for flight tickets üíï
2019,4,Really nice app to find and compare flights for all sorts of destinations around the world!!!
2020,5,Had always relied on skyscanner for timing and planning my trips. Saves me a lot of effort and money!
2023,1,Old lay out was good new update is not good and not used friendly
2023,1,has been terminated showing
2019,2,theres a green yellow and red marker to say how cheap the flights are but yet they are all wrong sometimes the red are cheaper then the green this seems broken and need to be fixed
2022,5,Great app for all types of travelling...Gives you very good price details and also let you choose from deal you prefer
2020,1,What the hell have you done to this app... Why will it only let me search for Zurich? Why doesn't it recognise Edinburgh? Why can't I just look for flights?
2020,1,"This app become rubbish , never able to book tickets always had race to get price , prices never stay same for 2 mins"
2018,4,Flight prices shown are slightly differred from actual but overall is informative and good for surveying and buying lower prices flight tickets through their agents/travel partners.
2018,1,Just won't let me search for train tickets. Does not open a menu to select departure and destination. DOES NOT WORK
2023,5,It is a nice app to manage your trips and any polace you visit and it also provide you good price for any trip and it also make your journey comfertable.
2019,5,Love using this app when I am in trip planning mode to be able to see all options on different dates then be sure I'm making the best decision price and time wise for me
2020,1,Absolute disaster! I want the former skyscanner back. Calamity just to make it look a bit funky.
2018,4,"Great app, easy to use, compare prices on flights and car rentals. I have found great deals."
2021,3,"Not as easy to use all as it used to be. When just 'direct' flights are selected, then just show DIRECT flight options please!"
2021,5,great app & so far it's best one I've found that actually has the cheapest flights. I'm still trying out a few others so will update if I find better one.
2019,4,it saves time and data. upu dont have to shift from app to another app to search for the cheapest flight
2020,1,"Why is there no list of price alerts I've added? The web version has it, but this app is confusing in terms of managing price alerts."
2018,5,Very gud. Like it . But sometime show the price but when u search u r stock becuase it is totally changed to higher prices. Please consider this.
2020,1,This was one of the best to compare flights now the worst. It's not user friendly....bring back the old version.
2023,1,this screen keeps coming up
2022,1,Never trust this sky scanner I just buy tickets when I talk with then they said they will pay me then now other person talking about fare if I booked early then it definitely cheaper then current price. Make sure before might be you next. Don't trust blindly it not deserve it.
2023,1,"It's doesn't show the lowest fare available anymore, sometime some airlines they don't show on their website anymore, seems like some airline perhaps pays more to be advertise on top"
2019,5,was a big fan of their flights anywhere function since their desktop site. app is nice too. gets me good ideas and keeps me daydreaming :)
2021,1,New updates have made this app unusable! This was my goto app to find and book flights but now it's too difficult to use. I hate it!
2020,1,Since received your answer seems promising. But you gave me totally false contact nor contactable. you dont even provide me a email thurs i can send you to read. you are just as same as GOToGATE people You have no responsible. It's been 3months But I am still waiting for refunds from GOTOGATE. Please don't you ever recommend nor connect with false airline who easily turn down on custome
2018,5,"love the new features, how ever the app will crash overtime. wish it can be overcomed."
2019,4,Very responsive app. Only downside is that it doesn't provide options for packages
2023,5,This site offers a quick snapshot of flights available and seems to be quickly keeping up with changes as they occur.
2023,4,"Good prices, could make it better by adding baggage allowance required. Also quick response to review, which means Skyscanner is listening üòä 1 star increased!"
2022,4,"Great place to find and compare fares for travel, whether it's domestic or international! Love ya work!!!"
2018,5,Been using Skyscanner for last 5 years. Brilliant. Have flown all over the world with it's aid. Thanks Skyscanner
2021,5,this is very helpful to find out the perfect flight and cheap cost . so I am really glad to use this app. everyone try this one .
2018,1,As soon as I clicked confirm the price changed and got charged for extra!Why didnt the bloody price change prior to me confirming my booking???Ridiculous #RipOff!!
2021,5,"Excellent search engine for frequent travellers, fast, efficient and most part of the time 100% reliable"
2019,1,very inaccurate pricing. found the same flights much cheaper on other sites. disappointing
2020,1,No cheaper flights simply promoting about less rates in advertisement on websites. Make my trip is much better.
2022,1,Sadly another declining app that used to be brilliant... Ruined by unnecessary updates... ( If it's not broken... Don't fix it ) .... It's a mess .
2018,1,"first time using it, did a search right after expedia to see if they have better deals and came up with nothing. don t even bother"
2019,5,Excellent site. I was searching all these websites independently and forgot I had this app. Found what I needed in less than ten mins. Love it!
2023,1,Worse than web service. Cannot select different months for return tickets. Cannot see all fares on table.
2023,5,best app for flight booking
2023,5,Time saved aswel money saved by searching us a lowest ticket price as our request and requirment
2023,1,"After update, the app doesn't save searches. I have to insert my data everytime I want to look for a flight."
2018,1,Prices are way higher then most sites. Checked the same flights on Expedia - $200 cheaper.
2022,1,"people used to say Skyscanner give us a best prices it's baseless compare to other site we better search it for them own airlines, no need to for third parties not such worthy"
2021,1,"Hi I have made the payment through the apps booking for airasia flight, but airasia show no payment was made. Kindly help me solve the problem"
2018,5,"Great app to explore travel options, but i wish the filters were more customizable"
2023,5,"Top-flight booking app - user-friendly, quick results, and competitive pricing."
2023,1,"Flop app, useless, not showing any booking made through skyscanner, also the customer care support is flop and usless, my 1 flight is not added to app, i am contacting customer service 4 times, very flop app and services"
2023,5,"I love Skyscanner It is easy to use, your able to get economically priced flights and they have great hacks for flying."
2023,5,Great App and the prices are cheap not from this world
2019,2,No need to fix what is not broken. From easy intuitive app went to cheap unclear interface
2023,4,"It is a very good app, it guides me to have some ideas about the cost of my upcoming trip costs."
2021,1,Useless during covid. Map appears one way and is totally different. Really poor.
2022,5,all the information you can need in one app. multiple airline in a matter of seconds . amazing app will be using a lot in 2022
2020,1,"Keeps crashing, freezing, and seriously not friendly. Absolute waste of space. Uninstalled."
2019,5,easy app to use. very quick accurate and responsive. We use it all the time
2018,5,It's fast and convenient during trip to find flights and hotels when itinerary changes are requested.
2019,5,"Awesome app, just found smoking deal on tickets. Deal that was no where to be found on websites."
2019,5,"Easy to navigate, pick your dates, see each day price etc. Excellent"
2019,1,Very poorly designed. This application is extremely difficult to use and it is full of bugs. Stick to the website!
2019,5,"Great app, gives many lines and price options when looking for flights."
2020,1,"This app is a joke.. fake availability that never exists when you click, broken links.. I think you guys should stick to desktop site.."
2023,1,Can't even log in. Error message when putting in the 4 digit code. How can an app fail so hard right out of the gate?
2019,5,"Great app, easy to use, always use it before searching other sites. The explore function is excellent."
2022,5,"It's easy to use,you can make quick search for hotel bookings,cars for hire and much more interesting things.Thanks Skyscanner for this incredible app"
2019,5,I really love the new look of app and website. I always used Skyscanner to find the best flights.
2019,1,I love the skyscanner website but the app doesn't let me search a whole month to find the cheapest dates.
2018,5,Take it from someone who books a lot of flights and has used a lot of sercices/apps - this is the best one to date!
2019,1,"I hate the new update, they've taken away the multi city search and you can't change cabin class! Why remove functionality? Deleted."
2020,1,Used to be a good app. It's now more complicated to use and half the flights it finds are unavailable...
2023,5,"Hi the apps now is very friendly. But for laptop full website, i cannot find the aircraft type. It will be good to have this info for laptop website too."
2018,5,I like it because it is easy to use and keeps me up to date with prices. Also lets me know when prices change
2023,5,This is the best app for comparing prices of different airlines/websites. It will get you the best cheapest prices. Loved using it!!
2019,5,very useful app. i do all my bookings through Skyscanner and it gives me the best deals. great app
2022,5,Great app. Used loads of times to search for flights whether direct or including stop over. Not fond of logo.
2019,2,yes it shows cheap flights but when you plan to boom always getting message that the price changed
2021,5,Best place to choose flight options. Prices are also always very competitive.
2022,1,"Waiting refund from 15 days, when i call the support all of them told me that the refund process will start today, calling from past 10 days and same response. Useless app useless support and fraud."
2021,1,Before i loved the app it was easy to find good flights but now its so difficult and not nice that i will deinstall this app really don't have fun with this.
2023,4,Quick and Easy to use
2022,5,it's very informative and useful to book tickets as we can get many alternatives to book flights.
2023,5,Different Styles Different Offers Good Sky Scanner
2023,5,it's too good with multi city trips
2021,2,"1. Are you an online seller or just search engine for flights, hotels etc? 2. If the flight is canceled or delayed, how fast your service to inform the customer? 3. If the customer wants to change his flight after booking, does he can?"
2023,5,software very nice and praise also very nice
2023,4,The website stopped working üòû
2023,5,easy and beneficial
2023,2,does not give an option for flexibility.
2021,1,The layout is frustrating! Please change it back or have option to view traditional format. Uninstalling.
2023,2,keeps shutting down my multiflight screen..aaargh
2023,1,Prices on their website never ever match the airline. Always under priced by a couple hundred dollars.
2020,1,The new format is just too difficult to use booked many flights from old style but impossible using it these days
2019,5,"Skyscanner has never let me down, been using it for 2 years, couldn't recommend it enough."
2022,1,Showing cheapest fare in the app and when you proceed ahead with that and boom you'll a find a different fare from website or service provider. Idk what's going on?
2020,1,Return the graph chart !! You're losing customers ... a year ago you were the best flight search app ever ... listen to the feedback!
2021,5,great app for Travel India and any where in the world. we wish all the best for them. hope to receive one trip flight ticket free for me .thanks üôè
2022,4,"More of the Matrix Tabulation would be a good idea. Also, Nonstop option on main search, where is it? Thanx."
2020,5,Good design and easy to use. Like the reduced CO2 notifications for flights
2018,5,I could buy multiple cities tickets with this App. It's very helpful as other App doesn't have this features.
2019,1,I hate the cluttered new look....just looks like you are trying to upsell everything! Horrible UI/UX.
2019,1,One big fault. It does not remember the amount of ppl for every saved search Please update me once fixed. Thanks
2019,5,Very convenient to search for prices..offers and can buy directly from here instead of search and buy elsewhere..
2020,5,"I had an issue which got resolved. App developer was very helpful in guiding me for online customer service. Good app, highly recommended."
2019,4,Good experience every time with the best prices and saving me the trouble of going to every individual company.
2022,1,"Doesn't work on Xiaomi Mi9 Lite,keep stopping when I open the application. PS:Yes,I did try to uninstall and install again,the app keep closing."
2022,5,After finding this app I literally don't buy tickets anywhere else. This is basically a hack to travelling. Love this app!!!!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
2022,1,"Very poor service,didn't mention properly for ticket changes and take 4 months to refund the money, not recommended to use this application"
2020,1,Update is terrible. Results disappear after they show up while app is searching.
2019,4,"useful app. unfortunately once it collected cookies and know what yiu want, it will sell tickets more expensive. done same search form different devices and got difference"
2019,5,"Fantastic App, has all the features you would expect and need to book a flight or a vacation package."
2019,5,"Honest, informative and comprehensive. A real help to find the best, cheapest or most adequate flights."
2018,2,"Good ui , but it gave me multiple SOLD OUT flights that I had to sign up and finish purchasing tickets before it would tell me. Nearly worthless"
2023,2,"Difficult to find in a range of dates Don't alert me, when price is going up. You should give recommendations based on a past data"
2019,5,very user friendly and has so many different ways to find good deals. whichever way you want to search for it
2021,3,Why on earth the tickets for the country I'm looking for are in the language of the destination and not in English? How am I meant to purchase them if I don't speak the language? It happens to EVERY website I went to
2023,5,excellent service and genuine prices
2022,2,I hate that when you search for flights in a whole month it tries to be clever and show you the best prices for irrelevant dates. The website handles this much better imo showing the prices for outgoing and incoming flights per day of the month
2021,1,"Made more difficult forced to remove from phone and turn to Google flight old version was better, best way is to sack app development team and ask user what wrong"
2023,1,"Can't choose departure airport or destination, comes up blank. This has been happening for 2 weeks now."
2020,3,Price increases once you check the flight more than 2 times. So i had to buy a ticket somewhere else
2023,3,Very best app to travel your journey. It is safe and happy journey fully relaxing and enjoying.
2020,1,"You don't show diagrams with prices anymore, thats the main reason I used your app all the time, BUT NOT ANY MORE, too bad!"
2019,5,it's the best one I've used. Accounts for non connecting flights to save thousands.
2022,5,Hii skyscanner i have an idea for update The idea in category flight please put how long the flight is example: I searched American to Egypt And it will say how long the flight is to Egypt Btw the app is super duper amazing 100√ó more amazing!!
2018,5,My brother lead me to this app said it was legit and I believe it is. Couple hundred dollars less than my usual trips for now anyways we shall see in the future! Thanks skyscanner for now hehe
2022,4,"I booked last three times on this site and got lowest price comparing to other sites like easemytrip, cleartrip, MakeMyTrip etc .. price difference was more than 15% awesome!!"
2019,4,I been try to paid for my trip since this morning until evening. but it keep showing payment fail. why? I'm sure that my card info is correct and still valid
2019,5,it helps me a lot to book my cheap flights. a must application for a person who travels a lot.
2021,4,"Great app, user friendly, could be improved with a date grid to view several options at once"
2019,5,My favourite app for finding cheap flights. The webpage is still a little better for some searches but the app is handy.
2019,5,This weather app is by far the best weather app available and version 2 is excellent. Thank you for your enormous efforts in developing this app.
2019,1,Slow. Issues with results until clearing and re-applying filters.
2019,1,Prices are just plain wrong. What's the point in have price alerts when the price isnt genuine in the first place. Uninstalling this waste of space.
2023,5,"Best prices and I'm not sure what the other reviews are about, but when I click on a price it takes me directly to the airline website with the exact same price to book it"
2019,5,"Very convinient application, easy to use, finds the best prices. Would recommend! :)"
2022,2,"Great, except it allows bookings through TripMonster who are completely inept, useless, and uncontactable"
2019,3,"I always use the app, I like it. But I can't search for a hotel atm. When I click on the button nothing happens. I'm on a pixel phone"
2019,5,"this is great. have used for months and multiple flights/hotels,always get the best deals."
2023,5,Best useful application!
2019,4,It's been very helpful app to discover least price and also when l chose the date it knows me the prices of the days by putting colour to the day as it high or low in price
2023,4,very nice app.
2022,1,Terrible if the contact number that is supposed to be 24/7 doesn't work for an entire day when you need to get in touch with someone!
2019,5,I've been with Skyscanner for more than 10 yrs now. International and Domestic flights with this travel site everytime!
2023,5,very good app.
2021,1,Latest version is catastrophic!!! Impossible to find one way ticket!!! Terrible!!! Everything is messed up
2018,5,Just the app I was looking for to book last minute travel based on budget to any destination.
2023,1,This app is awful compared to the website. Sort out the dates and direct flight options and it might get better.
2023,5,very good app
2022,5,Really helpful in quickly shortlisting and comparing the best flights :) Awesome experience!!
2018,5,I use mainly for Air Line fair checks and availability. It's exactly what I was looking for.
2019,5,best app for traveling. hands down. I have used it for the last 2+ years and no complaints.
2021,1,The price suddenly goes 3k higher than what showed on app. This is really very disappointing.
2022,5,It's always a hassle free experience using Skyscanner to book for my flights. Thank you for this app!
2020,1,I am long time user of skyscanner. . With over 50 flights booked..but this new app makes me mad.. cannot workout properly..shows no colums any more.. just dates.. not handy at all.. from 5 stars now to 1
2019,4,so for I really like the app for searching. I can't say if it's good all the way to reservations because I haven't made a reservation yet.
2018,5,Awesome way to find flights and set up alerts to watch prices if you have time.
2019,5,pretty good. great for mobile use where you don't have space to see all of the other travel websites
2022,5,LOVE this app and that it doesn't keep cookies. that's the best part and the ONLY reason I've been using it for years!
2022,5,"I am very GLAD from use of this APP....very informative app for air lines tickets and hotel booking...i was wondering to see the app didn,t cut any commisions... GREAT WORK Skycanner app team...Huge and Big love from Pakistanüå∑‚ù§Ô∏èüáµüá∞üåπ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2022,5,"it's super awesome app , that compares price with different agent apps and fetch you the best deal. it has helped me save a lot"
2018,4,"very nice app. Only down side is sometimes it will show the wrong price, but that is very rare."
2023,3,The fare rate is same as in Amazon or Flipkart or other travel booking partner...not large difference of fares ..
2019,5,"I really like the ""explore every where"" option in flight search tab. I recommend this app to all of my friends"
2021,1,"BOOKING CANCELLED AFTER THE CONFIRMATION EMAIL. I booked the flight through sky scanner online, paid the amount full and git the confirmation email of booking. After one hour, sky scanner cancels my booking without my consent and provide me with cancellation email which is so unethical, irresponsible behaviour of the sky scanner. They told me that my amount will get back to me after 5-10 days. This is so wrong, they pushed me into this dark and they are not accepting their fault."
2019,5,"dude it is awesome, if you're looking for a flights that are really quick really cheap and really reasonable and this is the explicit you should be looking at"
2023,5,affordable in price
2018,5,This is always the best price for flights. I have never seen it give me a higher price than any other site! Love this
2023,4,very nice and usefull
2023,1,I can't find cheap flight
2023,4,useful all in one place
2023,5,the best traveling application evevr
2023,1,"""Very deceptive & sneaky business practice"" Never use it!"
2023,5,Always finds me the best price for the best flights. I have use the app many times and it has saved me thousands on dollars.
2023,4,best search engine
2023,2,want more information
2023,1,support team response late of Skyscanner vendor.
2023,1,hi I cannot find my saved flight
2023,5,make me easier to find flight 9lor hotel for my trip
2023,5,I love your service excellence
2023,5,love using the app
2023,5,traveling to be completed
2023,3,Keep working you will get it Worthy
2023,5,I like this app so much
2023,5,simply the best
2023,5,I love this app
2022,5,very good app to look for least flight fares.. we should not waste time to search.. This simplifies our search for budget flights...
2019,4,been using this app for a couple of years. best feature? destination to anywhere for that spontaneous vacation:)
2023,5,fabulous app for a good comparison on prices
2019,5,"While you cant find some airlines on here, it is usually my go to app for finding great deals on flights."
2019,1,"This is the worst update ever in all kinds of apps. I have using your app for the last 5 years,but this new update is embarrassing really. Goodbye"
2022,1,"I will never use again this app, flight network is the worst company ever after a week they are not able to reschedule a trip that Emirates deleted . Plus many people are waiting for a refund after 2 years."
2020,1,"Unable to view cheapest dates in graph format or show prices on a monthly view anymore, very disappointed this has been removed"
2018,5,Use this app at least twice a year for my travel and so far it is the only one I trust for competitive prices.
2020,1,Sorry but the new layout is terribly non practical. Why change something that worked fine for years and was handy like the web/desktop version?
2019,5,"Easy to use app with many features to tailor my search and, most importantly, it consistently finds best airfare!"
2019,5,"simple to use, sends timely updates and has allowed me to snag some excellent deals."
2021,1,Still difficult to use. Flights list gets cut by ads. Ridiculous!
2020,1,App is a joke. I search for a city. And nothing happens when I try to choose that city. Horrible programming
2019,1,"i did flight booking via skyscanner,happygoeasy portal,4tickets,money got deducted,its almost 24 hours,but no communication from them,No PNR generated, i mailed them twice ....why do you allow such portal on skyscannner? take immediate action and get my flight booked ASAP or be ready to face the next step in consumer court.i checked with indigo airlines,no booking is done on my name"
2018,5,"Use sky scanner everytime I'm planning a trip, so easy to use and compare flight prices."
2020,1,"Rubbish since the last two updates, can only search for economy. Please fix. Nope, just shows economy"
2022,1,"The app asks for my email address, tells me I'm already registered and to log in, but doesn't give a way to log in."
2018,5,I like the price change alert the most. Have save me a lot in buying flight tickets during festive holidays.
2020,1,Do not book your flights through skyscanner i book a ticket from europe to india they cancelled my flight ticket and there is no proper response and my money is not refunded ( And the main problem is my debit card details have been taken from someone and used for shopping so do not add you personal bank details are credit and debit card details )
2018,5,"This is an amazing App....since I found this, I have done more than 95% of my bookings through Sky scanner."
2019,5,I find Skyscanner to be extremely helpful in order to compare flight prices and routes. Highly recommendable.
2019,5,Amazing app to search for cheap flights. Skyscanner is my go to whenever I need to travel and this app is so helful to me.
2019,5,"We used this app for a taxi from the airport in Berlin. Amazing service, luxury Mercedes driven by a properly suited chauffeur! Excellent price, would recommend ."
2023,5,Best place to Book Flights!
2019,4,"I LOVE this app! it would be a 5 star if yoy could enter in a budget, and it give you road trip desitnations too"
2021,1,"The new interface is not user friendly at all, please fix it, I used to use ur app alot b4 this new update."
2019,1,can you fix the date options. choosing a date closes the the date menu and returns to home page. so annoying
2019,5,Love this app! So convenient and intuitive. great tool for the savvy traveler.
2020,3,One Option is missing In website we can know the exact rate of the flight while selecting dates but in application this feature doesn't...
2020,1,"Doesn't work anymore. Perhaps an update has broken this but I'd like to decide myself when to update the app, I don't like forced updates."
2018,5,Very happy! Like the Explore feature when searching for deals a few months out
2021,5,Great application! I use this for all my travel needs! Has great accesibility and great information.
2019,5,Amazing app. I hope that they would include a page that displays all of my subscribed price alerts.
2019,5,"most cheapest and great value of money, it helps much in trip planning especially for whome budget orignted"
2019,5,Great app for finding cheap flights as well as easily bring able to see when the cheapest moment to take a particular flight is
2021,1,"It is no longer a great app as all flights are so expensive and it's just rubbish now , l am going to uninstall just doesn't do it for me anymore ."
2023,1,Keeps asking me to confirm I am human and when I do it throws an error and send me back to the same page... Poor user experience
2022,1,Poorly thought of app I would of expected better Change currency a vodoo trip to find setting for this simple function Nearby airports Where is the setting?
2019,5,"Best deals a woman needs when society has escalated this last few years. So if anyone reads these reviews take this app use it you save heaps and quick, easy no stress involved. A+"
2023,1,Beware. Automatically changes dates to show cheaper rates. Always check before booking
2019,5,I get this app with my friend and I use this app so quick 100% right answer special thanks for skyscanner management you make easy the world's. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
2020,1,Can't use it. Stuck in the calendar and it won't let me out. Had to uninstall and reinstall to try again.
2019,1,"When I try to log in, it brings me to an Amazon login page. Enter info, it says not logged in and cycles back to log in page. Is this a scam trying to get Amazon log in info?"
2022,1,"Useless app hard to set dates use a pc What a, bad experience if you cannot make it functional for normal. People add dates like pc quit your job and find another tech boss who lived to be a adored Have the guts to tell the truth"
2019,1,"new updated app is worse, how to select flights for the cheapest month, unable to find that feature, better to use google flights instead"
2019,5,"I love this app you get given lots of options, must be careful when booking though, I live in Australia and assumed all the prices were AUD, got caught.üò±"
2020,1,Horrible app. Just installed. Every flight I checked was over $5000. Yes. $5000 to from Cleveland to CT.
2021,1,"worst update ever , every time I try to use it it takes me 5 mins to set one way ticket or return. Looking for alternative apps"
2019,5,"I've compared this app with other apps, this is good and easy. But I wish this app can be move to SD Card."
2021,1,Worst application Tried to book hotel they took amount at that place nothing like hotel they make us fool. I lost my ¬£42 and my trip as well
2019,4,a nice one for comparison.. but the final price is always different at the time of payment
2022,5,I've only had this app for a week and it has given me so many more options than any other apps for flights. Love THIS.
2020,3,"Sunday is set as the first day of the week, despite device settings; no option in the menu to change it"
2019,5,"I've been using the app for a few years now. Simple navigation, self-explanatory, great details."
2018,4,Good app. Sometimes the rates change by the time it redirects to the airline website.
2022,1,"DEAR PUBLIC DON'T BOOK TICKETS VIA SKYSCANNER APP. cheating poor public money?? Last August 16 i was booked a ticket through Skyscanner app - budget air, but ticket was not booked, Till now the amount also not refunded BOOKING REFERENCE NUMBER BIN-5129158"
2022,2,Fake prices. Shows a certain price on a date but then select that day and the prices always much more
2021,1,All the new updates are making the app rubbish to navigate. Gets more complicated and useless with every update. ‚òπÔ∏è
2023,5,best app to find great rates.
2019,4,"Fantastic site that brings you the best prices, venues and places to travel too at an affordable price !!"
2023,5,real helping app

2023,5,i found good option!!
2020,1,Missing all useful functions as: Follow multiple dates to see when is the lowest price.
2019,2,Size of this app is getting out of control. Every update swells it even further. Becoming far too cumbersome now to retain.
2019,5,easy to use; scans a large range of travel companies; can create alert.
2023,1,It looks more like a click bate... you click on a price ans it's never the one you selected but one way more expensive
2019,4,"Edit: Good app, works quite well, jist has a few bugs on older smartphones, thats all."
2023,3,Can get better on others

2019,5,This is the first app I open whenever im looking to travel. always on point and never has any glitches of sort
2022,1,There's absolutely nothing special about this app. I was looking for a cheap ticket and I couldn't find not even one. Waste of time and energy.
2022,4,Great app for planning and also fantasising! Can't find the 'cheapest month' option tho which I can on the website
2022,1,"Scrap app.. while searching it showed reasonable prices n ones v try booking, d flights either showed full bookings or prices increased rapidlyüò†"
2023,1,Traveltrolley is a fraudulent travel agent operating via Skyscanner to trick and scam travellers. They denied me of Extra check in luggage which traveltrolley charged me for. I need my refund or i report it as a fraud and take a legal step.

2019,5,"Great app. Tells you everything you need to know, like when you get there at certain time that there is no public transport available."
2019,5,"very helpful. Love the ""anywhere"" destination feature. great for price watching."
2019,5,Fantastic to plan a last minute holiday and perfect to find out more information about destinations and prices.

2019,5,"Very good app, good to be able to compare flight costs. Very helpful. Highly recommend this app."
2019,5,I have been saving money on Sky Scanner for years and this App makes it even easier to save money.
2022,5,it's cheaper than the other apps I use plus it show you how much it'll be on the day on the calendar which is very helpful
2021,3,I think there is a change on the App. I do not really like this new version. It's not easy for searching flight.
2020,1,The new interface is awful. The app used to be easy now it is difficult to get it to do what you want
2023,4,Better rate provider than others but remember it is a search engine so keep your eyes üëÄ open while buying from sites listed. Great effort Anyways.
2023,5,very good i will confirm today

2022,1,"I booked a flight, and it was not a transit, and I lost couldn't reach my destination because I couldn't get in to the first plane due to this problem"
2023,3,"definitely doesn't work as advertised, will search for one thing and get completely unrelated results"
2023,1,The touch precission os off when selecting dates
2022,5,"üò°üî•Be careful of the redirected websites like travelwings üò° after i bought the flight no confirmation received and they council my trip before 4 hours of the takeoff time and they said your paid amount ia refunded verbally when I called , no email yet for the refund and I've to rebook my flight with higher price again üò°üò°üò°üò°"

2023,3,a bit more expensive than the other apps
2023,1,"Price manipulation, fluctuating prices"
2023,1,too often the prices listed when you go onto that dates tab (lowest price under each date) is not matched when you click into the date
2022,3,"incorrect pricing for flights is a consistent feature, if the sites donthave the fare dont show them for sale, sadly lacking integrity"
2019,5,Easy to use and all of the companies I have purchased tickets from have been very fast and professional. Recommend.
2023,1,Not showing all air lines .
2023,1,The month that was shown as default was the next month. Instead of showing the next month. Made me lose money for wrong month booking
2022,2,Dont install with any hope to get cheaper deals... ClearTrip gives much much better deals than this. Uninstalled.
2022,1,"It directed me to a fraud agency called trip, they just ripped me 3000$ for a booking and eventually got no tickets. It is un trustable."
2019,5,"Great app. Easy to use, easy to navigate, prices accurate."

2019,5,Very helpful in flight watching! I've been using it for quite awhile and I have no disapprovements while using it üòä Great app üëç
2019,2,this app needs to be more flexible. I can't change my currency. It always shows the currency that I don‚Äôt want. disgusting
2019,1,"personal data sharing with facebook without my permission - not cool and should be investigated for violation of laws. Uninstalling now, and will advise anybody I know to do so as well."
2019,5,"Very informative, and easy to access. To find so many flights on one site is awesome !"

2020,1,"New app is not user friendly, you guys are going backwards, looks like some cheap developer, just send him home."
2020,1,I book one airline ticket through this app via trip site.i canot travel on that day because of globel situation of covid19.They gave me a vocher number and tell me that you can reebook the ticket. No one till now responds to that mail that how to use that voucher.where i put that vocher number to radeem my new ticket.Dont cheat the costomers like this.very bad experience from this site.i will not give you any star.who is the responsable ?
2022,1,Useless app. Does not display anything whereas searching directly on airlines websites works perfectly
2019,4,very good to have preview on airplane price. but need more price source from more reputable online agent.
2019,5,its a best fights campering application. very cheap. and payment options is better from other websites
2021,1,Rates from website and app are different its really strange to see such thing. UI is bad website is far better

2018,4,Really helpful. Helped a great deal to compare flights. I highly recommend it üòé
2020,1,Really bad update. Why to take a great app and downgrade it to bad not comfortable app ‚ùì I'll go to your website instead but it will make me search an alternative app.
2019,5,Lots of fare options lots of choice airlines. About time Skyscanner opts for 1 stop ticket purchase instead of links to travel agents were prices can change.
2020,1,"Unusable garbage. Claims to have found a flight for 600‚Ç¨, then only displays flights starting at 900‚Ç¨."
2019,5,excellent service! spent ages trawling different sites shouldn't have wasted my time. Mal
2018,4,Good to check flights and prices. I rarely use it to actually book a flight.
2020,2,The price that show on the cover before click into the flight detail is not match with the real price of the flight ticket.
2021,1,"Booked a flight, paid in full and they canceled it 3 days before I was leaving! Horrible!!!"
2019,2,New user experience i dont like. Hard to compare prices to a location over a period of time
2018,5,Great app. So easy to use and I like having the widget on my homescreen for leasure travel.

2018,4,"Great solution for flights comparison, the filter and system to sort the flight is very useful for me"
2018,1,Search does not work. If I set a search why does it reset every time I click any selection ? Useless
2023,5,"Used it for years, the original version was still the best because you could find lowest price per day over a month"
2022,5,A wonderful yet simplistic medium for the best and most competitive rates.

2023,5,Very useful app
2019,5,Easy to use. All the best flight options available. I always use Skyscanner when booking my international flights.
2019,5,This app is a very accurate and realistic predictor of airfares.It is translating travel into a unique experience.
2021,3,Easy to search flights but the price shown are different on app and website.
2022,5,Great App and i realy thank skyscanner to make my trip easy and low cost.. really appriciate the app and it can easy to use... thanks a lot...
2019,5,"Great app and deals, very easy to use! Couldn't ask for more from skyscanner üòé"
2018,5,Excellent app for travelers! I can manage my trips through this app very well. Thumbs-up guys.
2018,4,There should be more options for flexible dates other than that this app works great compared to others.
2019,1,The worse application.i booked a tickets 2days ago. they charged me a price. then they changed it after 2 days. GUYS J DONT RECOMMMMEEEEND THIS APPPP.
2023,1,totally fake application show price cheap book in higher price always show airlines increase the price... lol

2023,5,Offers better deals than any other app you could possibly find.
2023,5,best app to find all airlines cheapest air fare and explore places
2023,1,When I choose option to travel everywhere it gives me non existing country/coloniser.
2023,1,"hello dear a three days before I made a air ticket through your app, and a provider he showed the ticket price 69 KD PLUS 3 KD For some services it means TOTAL 72KD, but go to go deduct 83 KD FROM MY ACCOUNT, Already I emailed but nobody replied,"
2022,1,Shows low cost but at time of booking very high price. Frustrated with app. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò•üò±üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨
2020,5,Great app for finding best prices for weekend getaways and vacations. I love you this app.
2019,5,"Somethings are still missing, but is the best app or web to find cheap flights. excellent"
2022,1,"Useless and time wasting, when would u going for booking immediately price will be increase. I will say, cheater and criminal mind set oriented. Don't use this app"
2023,1,"needs work, is unable to search, and splits the whole months to find the best flights, i will still use web search instead"
2023,5,In the beginning I was very sceptical about it cause prices were really low. But it really a real deal. I used their website so no idea about how's the app is. Thanks guys
2018,5,"Love it! Fast, easy flight search and comparison! My new travel best friend!"
2023,1,"Display of Price is different and after selecting, prices rises by 3 times It happens everytime This is just to attract the customers on their tie up websites Not helpful at all this app"
2022,3,It could be a great app if bag allowances were added with every ticket during search.
2018,5,Very good app. Gives you clear perspective of damage and various options to minimise it.
2022,4,"I love this for long years, but thought today strongly it's nice if having a sorting with each alliances for milage purpose!"
2023,5,not support your travel patner i am try but not my book ticket
2019,2,Was fine until I updated it. How come I had multicity option before the update and now I don't have it? This is what I use the most!
2021,1,I bought tickets Bravofly from skyscanner they cancelled and few hours ago of my flight and even they didn't return my amount in my credit card yet they said it may take 72 hours but it's been 10 days now
2019,5,Sooo easy to use. Could do with a flight destination map with from prices this would make it awsome....
2020,3,Skyscanner seems to get worse and worse everytime I use it. It's trying to do too much.
2019,5,I have used many of other websites to buy tickets and Skyscanner always gives me the best price.
2018,4,"Even better than the desktop version. Visual, fast & covers most airlines."
2023,5,Great best price
2021,4,"Great app, I always use it. One thing tho, my currency is set to Euro but I receive promotions in Pounds."
2020,1,Ive used that app for a long time but the latest version i so user u friendly. Give us back the old Skyscanner
2020,2,Hi hum. Just another trip planned. Used to be this unique resource for tracking air traffic.
2019,4,"Good tool, but I haven't been able to do a best dates search with multiple cities."
2019,1,Uaed to be great for searching everywhere. Not anymore. Too many unnecessary changes.
2019,1,The app took me to a Fraud Website. I booked the ticket and I haven't got the eticket but just the payment slip.This app is a fraud app as well i suppose.
2023,1,Very very bad my experience this app I am booking to flight to this app but I want change date and time not obtion to this app and Ur partner apps

2021,2,"Ugh, please dear God bring back the old UI. The search to and from setup is HORRIFIC!!"
2022,5,there is a very good app with the help of which you can do your work. All its feathers are made according to your needs.
2019,5,"There's always a ""wow"" factor to someone whenever I introduce this app. Traveling is fun!"
2019,4,Filters and notifications aren't easy to manage.
2019,5,This is my go to app when looking for my next holiday flights. Never had a problem it always works just fine
2020,4,I reported an issue with this app and got a really fast response and fix. Now it works. Thanks.
2019,5,"absolutely love the app as all information is gathered together, very easy to use."
2022,1,"gives incorrect prices, waste of time when I goto book the flight, price changes, so many shady companies like mytrip etc."
2022,5,Very helpful application. But sometimes have to suffer a lot with partner agencies
2019,5,Love how it gives several different rates and flights. Keeps me up to date with all my preferences. just wish it had pkgs
2019,5,"very very useful, a little hard to navigate the app, but that could be because I'm a bit of a technophobe"
2022,5,"Excellent site to get best deals on airfares, and it doesn't charge you too much for any airlines that you prefer to travel by."
2019,1,"I can't select fly in and out of same airport in the app, also doesn't show me more than 2 results?"
2019,5,"Have used this app several times to book flights. No problems, info always good."
2021,2,It's been absolutely ruined. It's now almost impossible to navigate. For God sake restore the earlier version.
2019,3,"It was good to have this app for online booking. I hope you can send me alert whenever you have piso fare., thanks."
2019,2,Skyscanner what have you done to a great app. The price monitoring of flights no longer works
2019,2,the days are wrong in the calender part of your app. they are off by two days making it very difficult to search and plan
2019,5,This is the best app to plan your unplanned flights and locations.. extremely happy to update app as per my planning requirements
2019,5,best app ever i make the payment at lowest fares for my Singapore trip as if i was getting 1000-1500 rupees extra on each site excluding con fee i able to save alot
2021,5,"one of the best platform to book your flight tickets in cheapest price,indeed I like this app and refund policy also awesome."
2018,1,I found the ticket. But the price of ticket is higher than airplane company's. So I have to pay $80 over. How can this happen?
2023,1,"No longer works on flights. Updated to a new version, which won't let me enter start or destination points."
2019,5,Absolutely amazing. Able to compare prices and get a guide.
2020,1,Do not book with deal from GOTOGATE. Show cheap price but charge more. Hardly to contact with support center.
2023,5,good to get cheapest flights
2020,1,Why do companies who have a very usable interface always insist on changing it for the worst possible app replacement this app is now useless David
2023,1,When i search flight then showing one price but when i trying to book price increase so high.
2022,2,"The new version is bad !!! i wonna version from 2019!! We wonna old version !! With diagram for all year ! in calendar one price ,when you chose and serch flight price be difrent!"
2019,5,Good app. I've always used Skyscanner for narrowing down to the best flight prices.
2022,1,Skyscanner returns flights that are actually not available to purchase. Very annoying.
2021,2,"Baggage allowance information is missing, it will be easy if you add that."
2020,3,It does not show same prices as on web. The app is not user friendly or doea not work properly.
2020,1,"Used to love it, but this new update has stripped it of everything that made it special and even managed to make it worse than most of its competitors. What a shame"
2022,5,I am always thrilled about skyscanner. it is the best app to find good airline offers.
2023,1,Waste app.. amount got deducted. Did not receive my booking. No place to contact the customer care.
2022,5,I get like 1500 less price on this app then the original website of the airline and booking website i loved the experience i had with Skyscanner
2021,1,All the prices are lies. The prices are always inflated once I click on the search result
2023,1,Was great now un useable. Can't enter the from and to destination for flight search so the app is useless
2020,2,Since youre new update the price that you show are not accurate anymore... really disappointing i did love youre app before !!
2022,1,I purchased a ticket trough one of your provider travelgenio still I didn't get my ticket by email im trying contact them not reachable I need help to get my ticket or refund my money. Thank you
2020,1,"Newest update is super terrible,who comes up with stuff like that.Complicated to use,best features are gone.Change back or loose users"
2022,5,it's ok. unknown and not well reviewed sellers. would do a quick Google search of the site selling you that great deal before buying.
2018,5,"Useful application, providing any information someone will need for booking a flight. Very cheap prices available."
2021,1,The UI has changed completely. It took 10 minutes for me to check one way flight.
2023,5,very nice good low price
2019,5,"very efficient, will always scan for the lowest fare. hopefully it will remain this way and don't change later on... like others do"
2019,1,Wow those prices were terrible. better off buying directly from the airline for $400 cheaper!
2023,1,Very bad app dont use first showing low price ticket date wise but after click on that price increased its very bad
2019,5,"it does what is must do. good price comparison. no ads, just good rates."
2019,4,"the good price keeps disappearing after I select it, but it makes searching for a getaway easier"
2018,5,"I travel frequently and this is the app I mostly use. Simple, lots of info, amazing."
2019,5,"very easy app to use, nice that I could easily find the best flights. highly recommended!"
2019,5,this is quite helpful I found a holiday with this app then we booked easy jet flights via the computer great price for December thank you x
2019,5,great application. a suggetion for app is please add cheapest month option in application like Website to find cheapest one.
2019,5,"I have asked Skyscanner staff to pursue refund of the Jet Airways ticket. They do help and the travel agent Travelgenio, albeit their usual unresponsiveness, eventually reply."
2018,4,"Decent for booking flights, pity it can't run times and prices for multiple days at the same time."
2018,5,"Brilliant, makes identifying cheapest dates to fly very simple."
2019,4,Great app to find a good deal on airfare! It also has a book your hotel feature.
2019,2,"Used to love this app and used it frequently. However after the last update I can't open flights, hotels and cars"
2023,5,Super Awsome app for real time flight tracking and its quite accurrate as well. good app I will strongly reccomend
2021,1,Please change the app back! Why would you make it more difficult to find flights?? This is a terrible update!
2021,1,Since the update the search system is rubbish... too long winded. Preferred the old system
2021,5,I've gotten so many great deals through this app it's crazy. Just got a rental car marked down from 840 to 230!
2019,5,first off all LOVE U Skyscanner. bcz Have a very very good and very useful ideas. not in other app.
2021,1,It was really good before the new interface. Now it is impossible to use it. I will definitely try to find another app.
2021,5,I am using this application for 3 years. My experience was excellent üëå Thanks skyscanner
2019,5,"Excellent, user friendly app. Keeps settings you've already set up . Cheers Paul"
2019,4,easy to search. but sometimes the quick results do not match the details.
2022,5,Excellent price comparison between multiple online travel portal and you will not find such route options which you get over here
2021,1,"Hate the new updated app, where has the flight price graph gone? Is there any way I can uninstall the update to get the old one back? ü§îüò¨"
2019,1,showing wrong price and after completing transaction I did not got confirmed ticket and It is taking too much time to give refund.
2021,2,"It's been 6th time when I'm looking for tickets and it is showing me tickets that does not exist . It is ok 1 time, but not every single time"
2023,1,Useless app even their is flight on the date but no showing .
2018,5,"This app was suuuuper easy to use. Very smooth. Love it. Way better than any other ""travel app"""
2021,2,"Unfortunately i did not like the new version update ü•∫, I used to like the application and recommend it to everyone i know. But not anymore unless it will become like it was!!!"
2019,5,Been using this app for years and booked lots of flights without any issues...Love it so much!
2023,5,very easy nd good application
2019,5,great app... keep going back to check prices because it allows you to find the best deals
2021,5,Skyscanner is always my go-to site for flights. It always has the best prices.
2020,1,"Rarely write reviews, but the new UI of Skyscanner is just terrible. They ruined an amazing app :("
2023,5,Very nice application..... I found Very cheapest flight ticket compare to another application....
2021,5,I would recommend skyscanner to not include mytrip on your list. They are scammers. Just bought 3 tickets costing $3000 that i cant board and can't have refund.
2019,1,It does not work. It doesn't show even a quarter of flights from a chosen airport in a chosen time frame.
2018,4,Recently I've experienced many times the price didn't match when we enter the payment ... Please follow up about this ... Thanks
2019,4,"This application is good enough, i can compare price with other flight companies and choose the one i need"
2022,1,I gave one star because it shows less amount first then after you fill personal information it's price suddenly get high. Finally my opinion is don't trust such kind of websites. Please go through some other trusted sites.
2021,5,Very simple app in using it. Gives you all what you needed from information on your travel.
2019,5,"hi there, i find this app useful moreover i can save my time and my money with find a suitable flight....thank tou Skyscanner.üå∑"
2021,1,An empty app? I put in flights going anywhere at any time and got...nothing. Same for hotels and cars.
2019,5,"easy and best way to get comparisons. many a times, you get good deals also"
2022,3,Need information about baggage from the start with every flight!! Useless without that information!
2022,1,"Extremely untrustworthy for flight booking. We booked flight, and it led to untrustworthy sites where we lost 10k"
2020,5,Great for finding cheap flights anywhere. Have used it for many years.
2019,1,"really poor, doesnt load up airports anymore. edit. ive emailed you screenshots via the link youve sent. thanks."
2019,5,The site is user friendly and helps to choose from various available options for bookings.
2019,4,"In defense of this app, it does not ""exclude"" Southwest airlines fares. Southwest does not allow any fare search or purchasing app or website to display their fares. The only way you can search fares or buy tickets on Southwest is directly from them."
2018,5,"Best app I have ever used, always had the best deals compared to other apps and is easy to use."
2022,5,"Really awesome -- Skyscanners, rise up and shine. The best by far despite the weird comments. Keep it up, Godspeed!"
2023,5,Best app for flight search. Skyscanner should be your first and final stop for flight search
2019,5,Much better than the web page on mobile. And sure who doesnt like cheap flights?
2022,1,"Shows one price, u clicking - and trere is more expensive like in 2 or more times!"
2023,1,Why this app is only showing flights if we are traveling in out country with train or buses so we need to add our train ticket or schedule time of it and same fir busses too
2023,5,a good tool to find flights and prices
2023,1,To hard to use i will book some were easy
2019,5,I find good deals o skyscanner. And the app is pretty stable as well.
2023,5,most uncomplicated no nonsense rates
2019,5,"it's very handy, easy to use. always showing me the best option for what i look for."
2020,1,This app was super helpful. The new look sucks badly. Put it back to the previous version. üò†üò†üò†
2018,2,Why it does not have multi location flight to choose? Feeling different with the one in website.
2019,4,It provides the most convenient to book flight with a particular take off and arrival time.
2019,5,"Quick and Easy to pick the most up, also a variation of filter"
2019,4,"very helpful, but could be finding not just city to city, but country to country as well"
2019,5,My go to app for all things air travel! Easy and convenient right from your pocket!
2023,5,Best app cheap price no one is compare this app
2018,5,"So far. I like this app. For helpful and useful. I haven't used it to buy tickets yet, as that time is coming soon."
2019,2,Without being able to add baggage in the search the app is much more difficult than others like Kayak
2023,1,Your prices show on your web much more expensive than the actual airline. I become too scared to even book with you anymore. I wasssss so fan of your web not anymore
2020,1,You have completely destroyed the app with this update..where are business class options..the interface is awful
2022,1,It won't find any prices for a simple search (Netherlands to Bali) this app is useless as it is now.
2019,5,excellent guidance on flights....my go-to app when booking for work or pleasure.
2018,5,Awesome. Simple to use. Accurate. Does the work searching so I'm not going from site to site comparing prices!
2019,3,"The app is getting crashed , when I hit the back button after checking the flights list."
2018,2,Price graph is useless. You can never find flights in the fares shown.
2020,1,Bunch of thieves if you search for a flight a couple of times price goes up search on a friends phone 200$ cheaper.
2023,1,this application is not fair as per my opinion
2022,5,there is no person on this planet who doesn't like the idea of having all flights availability to check from mobile phone:)
2023,5,This app acutally saved me a ton of money including convenience fee. A must have for frequent flyers.
2022,1,they upped the price of my ticket while I was trying to book. Edit: I messaged them and they said there's nothing they can do.
2023,5,This is very helpful app for hotels searching around the world. Very easy to find hotel with best prices.
2019,4,"reallt very helpfull app to travell around the world.I m a adventure lover, this app is very very helpfull to me search my flights ....great..."
2019,4,Pretty comprehensive and notification of price change on watched flights is very useful.
2021,1,"Set filter to book a flight for 1 month in advance and the app sent me to book it for 1 week out on a nonrefundable ticket, dope first experience"
2019,5,App just helps in various ways to get at your target for cheap flights.i will recommend to others.
2020,1,"New interface very bad?? What is this! Tiu just simply killed you app simplicity i am remove it from my phone, you should fire your designers"
2022,1,Because it shows kiwi website which is is a fraud type of website Don't go with kiwi else at last you will find your ticket double of the price
2023,3,Like to use to check for flights but wouldn't use most of providers offered and often flight price not available.
2019,5,i always get my flights through skyscanner. some of the prices have been unbelievable.
2022,5,"this app is perfect, it shows you the ideal choice to you, the cheapest and the best prices for you."
2019,4,very cheap flights and combo offers among other applications...keep it up!!!
2023,5,Best for flight bookings

2019,5,good and help fully. very chipper flight rate and found other service. gooooooood..
2023,5,handy to help decide where to go.
2021,1,"It used to be the best app, loved it, now it's impossible for me to understand how it works honestly , don't like the (new) logo either"
2022,1,Can't book a flight. Just car hire and hotels. Used to be a brilliant app
2019,4,"Great app,most of the time is giving me good prices... Always they have work correctly."
2019,4,"they have good prices, not the cheapest but, it help, also it gives out some good tips !!"

2019,5,I absolutely love this app!!! I travel alot and use this app to find the cheapest route!!!!

2018,5,This app.saved me so.much time and money for me. I can never repay then for their great work.
2019,3,Theres no option for selecting whole month on the app. I always have to use the website
2023,5,A great app. Really amazed by its on time services. I would recommend to everyone.
2021,5,"very useful for it does all for you, no hassle to go through all the traveling companies apps."
2018,5,Consistently the lowest price fares among all the big name search engines.
2019,5,"i always find the cheapest rates on here. tried everything else like kayak, hopper, momo, cheapflights"
2022,4,Please add the option to search flights from multiple airports. That would be super handy.
2019,5,Very easy to use and to get updates for price changes in flights.
2023,1,"Limited search, is not possible to check available dates if looking for days in a month. Etc useless"
2022,3,This service was good but in the last time showing wromg prices and when u click to choose price go up like double
2018,5,"Fantastic app for when you just want to get away. Find the best prices to ""anywhere""."

2022,1,This site and app is not safe.i made a booking and it took me to a 3rd party site and charged my card yet upto now no ticket has been sent. Pls don't use this app.
2019,1,"Price are different when u click the website ! much much more expensive, very dissapointed!"
2022,5,So new to the app. So far so good. It's easier for me to browse in one place and compare the price
2023,2,last update is too uncomforttable
2019,1,The book for fligth is to expensive... i though its more cheaper than traveloka but its 2x the price.... wow!
2020,3,This app needs improvement. When I tried to book a flight it wouldn't let me. Not happy!!!
2019,2,Filtering is bad. App insists on taking flights that take longer than travelling by coach.
2019,5,"long time goto app. not too convinced with new style, but functionality just beats the rest. spot on"
2021,1,"My flight booking with Skyscanner with bravofly ,Helsinki to Hyderabad also amount 69114.20 but not confirmed both apps ,this both apps is scam don't loss money fraud apps, cheat public worst service scam"
2018,5,"Your travel plans, budget calculations, hotel comparisons and all at Skyscanner. Loved it ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2019,5,Must-have app But it doesn't seem to have the option to remove airline combinations like its website?
2020,1,You were the best cheap flight finder and you completed ruined it by stripping your explore tab of so many features
2023,4,Nice helpful app
2022,4,Cannot change email address through the app. Works very well otherwise
2023,5,"Fantastic site to find the best flights, and great prices for all your travel needs."
2019,1,i have booked a ticket now and the amount has been deducted from my account but i am yet to receive the tickets or any confirmation for the same. need you to look into this asap
2023,5,"Showing Scammer Website links for booking flights, I end up being scammed by Budgetair, but Rob from Skyscanner helped me out by continuous support. I must say very supportive people they have.... So changing my rating from 1 to 5 star"
2020,5,A good app to search for good flight deals. I've been using this since 2016 or 17.
2018,5,I love the explore feature and I always find the cheapest prices with this ap.
2018,5,"Got me the best deal in airline tickets and hotel room just like that, awesome!"
2023,1,"It shows less price on Skyscanner homepage, but when it takes to booking site price changes automatically."
2018,5,a reliable app on tracking and comparing flight fares as well as for using on other travel related activities...
2022,1,Aggressive full page sticky ads strips data no longer safe or usable thankfully it's an app of the past
2021,2,I love using Skyscanner but the new version is painful to use when searching for flights.
2022,1,Charging 35 percent as penalty for a flight cancellation and that too because of covid is too much. No airlines charge such high amount for booking cancellation due to covid
2020,1,Why on earth did you change it from the previous format? It was so accessible and easy to use!
2019,5,sky scanner is a wonderful app! you get some amazing deals here. . I strongly recommend.. Arez Australia
2022,1,"Very deceiving that you hide the fact that flights from a major low cost airline, JETBLUE, is not shown on your platform, this is robbing your users of millions in savings and rendering this app useless"
2019,5,Perfect application specifically once you need tracing your upcoming flight price it is ammazing tool thank you very much for such useful application.

2019,4,have gotten 2 airfares and both for super cheap. have not traveled with them. I will update when I do.
2021,5,Great Outlook on different countries you can fly to with an idea on how they are reacting to COVID.
2018,5,"so far so good, it did give me a very good pricing together with a headup about the relative websites friendliness"
2019,3,Be great if they could have the cheapest month or whole month option like they do on web/mobile browser
2018,5,Really very helpful app to plan your trip. You can save money.
2019,1,Complicated. Results are difficult to understand. Doesn't give opitions based on reduced cost/fare properly.
2019,5,"Best app for Airline Tickets I guess, I found cheapest rates as compared to other online ticketing apps."
2019,5,I use this app a few years already and this is the best app in this area for me so far. And I like it even more now after app been updated. Just awesome! üëå
2023,5,this app is awesome want to know the prices to go anywhere do exactly that put in a month pick where you want to go and check out the prices

2019,5,easy to use interface and does a great job of finding the cheapest flights. 5 stars

2023,5,it actually is really a very helpful app.... it price for the flights are the cheapest
2022,1,I think prices shown are just random. It shows you 45 but in the end it becomes 300 lol.
2019,5,best application to find cheap flights I just booked a international flight it was lot cheaper then anywhere.its just amazed me
2019,5,Ronseal - does what it says on the tin. Updates easy. Helpful tool.

2023,1,"Worst app, only shows 3 flight options and if I click show more it errors as network issue"
2023,4,Wonderful and very helpful app to book your airline ticket easily and on good prices
2019,5,Mt sister and I are planning a trip for a 9 day trip anywhere and your app is going to make this happen! Love this app!!!!
2023,5,more option and very easy app to navigate and understand.
2023,1,"from app perspective, 1600+1700 = 6500. Yhis is how it calculates the flight costs."
2023,5,"SUPER APPLICATION FOR DISCOUNTED OR CHEAP RATE FLIGHT BOOKING.... Book flight on Skyscanner with Trusted flight booking partners like Easemytrip, Goibibo etc. Do not book from any other flight booking partner It may cause you unnecessary headache..."
2023,5,"Does this app supports in Pakistan? Like for example, I have to go to turkey and i am buying tickets from this platform."
2023,5,"best price,, very low price...can't compare any one..."
2023,1,Really disappointed. Today i booked my flight from jfk to Lahore. Through oojo flight linked to your aap. They did not sent me my ticket and reservation number. In case if I lost my money then who gonna give my money back ?
2023,1,Skyscanner please don't refer tickets from happy fares. They behave so unprofessional..First book tickets ...wait more than 40 mins...
2023,1,Very bad experience.this application no have any contact number.even that no costumer support working.
2023,1,"I booked the flight, money has been deducted from my account but I didn't receive the e-ticket neither any any mail."
2023,5,"Skyscanner always brings for me the best search results, giving competitive rates for flights"
2023,1,"0* not accurate It shows some trips, but the airline companies have no trips on that date Stopp scamming us Wizz air as an example"
2023,4,"The experience is amazing, it makes it very easy for me to find a car I want to rent"
2023,5,Real fare and affordable... And please add a refering option for suggesting this app to a friend...üëç
2023,2,the decrease in options and capabilities is so frustrating
2023,5,After trying multiple apps I can say that skyscanner gives you the best deals of the day .
2023,3,"Since the last update, the app became very very slow. Please reviw"
2023,1,-5 ‚≠ê if I could give it! Your prices are 50% higher then other apps. Uninstalling so you can STOP STEALING MY PERSONAL INFO YOU BASTARDS
2023,1,It's not working I'm unable to click on the websites it doesn't redirect and the rates are not updated dynamically
2023,5,"Very well designed Application, provides very good rates."
2023,1,The app is very slow and not properly working
2021,5,Skyscanner Is good app for checking flight charge in different method ... Like it ... But ... Do not buy ticket from here üòÄ
2018,1,Became useless. Old version which was good stopped working. Greed is a killer.

2022,4,It's great for international tourism. I can't search by airport code for small airports.
2018,5,The search engine is easy to use. Flights even cheaper than Google Flights or Skiplagged!
2019,5,"Today is my 1st day using this apps and it is more variety, easier for me to choose the price base on my budget üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçThanks Skyscanner"
2022,3,Good app for booking but the prices showing in sky scanner and redirected websites is not same .The prices are increasing
2019,4,prices looks good but have not tried you yet for bookings and if all goes well with booking then look at 5 stars.....
2020,5,I am glad that Skyscanner is back the way it was and that the team actually listens to the users' opinions.
2019,4,Thanks for being created awesome app. I hope you can create new fitur setting price alert.
2018,5,im always browsing flights on here. its so convenient and i can always find the best price.
2022,5,"It should show, just like the web, a preview of the prices for the selected dates."
2019,5,"Easy to use, good flexibility to choose many flight options and obtain best price"
2019,5,"great app, many times sharp prices pop up, also a wide range of itinerary suggestions"

2018,3,"It doesn't save the user account information. Everytime I open the app, I need to sign in again."
2021,1,"It shows different results, so for sure you will end up getting different car after you arrive to your distenation."
2022,5,"Great flight comparison service, keeps you alerted in real time when the price of flights change."
2020,2,It used to be pretty good but now I can't save possible flights/flights I wanna keep my eye on.
2018,4,Well layed out information on each of the accommodation choices and relevent to our budget loved the pictures
2022,4,Helpful list of Flights; but some very long inexpensive journeys of several flights. :-)
2022,1,I have booked flight from Skyscanner from e-dreams they cancelled my flight with out any reason and when I tried to contact them i found they are scammers
2019,1,Faulty Thai bath currency setting. edit: You should tell user to reopen the app to make the change to take effect!
2018,3,can't search for 'any date' which i like to do for flexibility to find the absolute cheapest flights on the app
2023,1,some travel agents are fraud.They took money and provided fake tickets that don't show confirmed when checking with airlines.
2019,2,"I can't save anything. What's going on?? I can't save the flight tickets. It is just saying 'something went wrong'. So, what is wrong??"
2019,5,"Great app, always works, an essential tool for planning air travel."
2021,5,we always get good deals using Skyscanner so I recommend this even to my friends for traveling.
2018,1,"Everything went fine until i pressed the 'pay'.....then no confirmation mail ,not even a failed message... How should i know guys if i bought my ticket?"
2023,1,very Bad experience. Can't even login with Google or facebook. Tried multiple times it's irritating.
2019,5,Soooooooo much easier and simpler to use than other travel apps. I love it!
2019,5,"Simply the best app to book your tickets, with multiple options available, making itself the "" TRIVAGO""of the airline industry."
2018,5,"It help me search my flight, fixed my hotels. It make my trip arrangement smooth and easy."
2020,1,"Why you people.keep.on changing UI , the ui on 22 dec 2020 sucks...not able to search for whole month or cheapest Try to understand do not play with users , in terms of your new experiments, a user once uninstalls never installs back...so please bring the old options back....developers are dumb or the management is dumb . Experiment with other things...now i have to uninstall this as it is not the same as old. And no use for me"
2021,1,"Very bad and complicated update, previous versions were better and easier to use!"
2019,1,Changing doesn't always mean improving. Really unpractical after the latest update. üëéüèª
2022,3,"Overall good, but the missing option for direct flights only is very frustrating"
2019,5,top! best cheapest ticket machine app I've ever seen. I use it always when booking a ticket.
2021,1,It's harder to use now due to the confusing interface. I'm an Android Dev and this APP sucks now.
2021,1,"This used to be the best travel app to find flight, the latest upgrade makes it hellish to use .... Mist stupid app upgrade ever..."
2018,1,Misleading price. It should update the real price and not giving suprise to customer once clicked on the link
2023,1,"Limited options. Aps limits you to only few chosen companies and is not giving all possible flights, and cheap ones even are no appearing."
2019,4,"really good, if you like to do things last minute or need a flight fast, this is for you."

2021,1,"I cannot believe after the deluge of negative reviews of providers such as MyTrip, that they are still referred to on Skyscanner. It highlights SS feels it has no duty of care to its users. Do the due diligence SS"
2022,1,"Worst experience i selected one ticket but after one day i got mail that my ticket is scheduled for another flight, the duration of trip is 24 hrs.. Worst experience"

2023,5,"I love skyscanner, I'm using skyscanner last over more than 7 years and I'm very happy üòä"
2019,3,Why on the website it says Children under 16 but on the app it's under 12? On the app anyone 16 to 12 is an adult so ticket price is high but on the website it is cheap. A child is anyone under the age of 16. check before you book on the app.
2018,4,"There is a new airport which is not available in search list.Airport name is Kannur International Airport located at Kannur,Kerala,India.Flight has already started operating from there."
2023,2,Booking information is not stored in your App and ask the customer to check with the company for whom you acted as an agent. What is the need to download your App. It is a drain on our device memory bites.
2021,1,Booked flight in Jan from sky scanner their sub agent MYTRIP took money from my account but my flight was cancelled by airline now after 6 months I haven't received refund Better book direct from airlines as they process refund in 2 weeks

2020,1,"What have you done to a great app? Looks like you fubarred it. I now need to look for something else. Headquartered in Edinburgh, you must be fannies"
2021,1,"Tha App getting worthy, I changed the currency for Euro two times and it's in Polish ZLot again. I live in Manchester."
2023,3,When I was searching the price I've noticed there is no luggage details how many check in bag could be allowed.
2019,5,Very easy to use and you can always find the best prices.
2023,1,Nothing seem reasonable. The price listed here on this app are way to high from other booking apps like Kayak
2020,2,why the heck is your user interface from very good to suddenly becoming very bad?
2020,1,Your partners are cheating as the price is not same.. I tried to book on agoda and price was high as compared to what it is on your website..
2019,5,Does the hard work of searching multiple airlines for great flight prices!
2019,5,as per my experience i really say it is superb app according to others portal and booking apps
2022,5,"awesome app, now I m addicted of this app.Very useful app for Business person who visit different locations.."

2020,1,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS APP. SKYSCANNER YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED WORKING WITH THIS COMPANY. They work with vayama and they do not answer their phone to get a refund or anything. Turkish airlines canceled the flight and they returned the money to vayama and now vayama is holding the money, and THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY BUT THEY WONT RETURN. THIS IS CRIMINAL, AND I WILL PURSUE WITH LEGAL ACTION. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS APPLICATION"
2019,4,"great app , just needs to be a little more in depth ..like the website"

2018,1,Website is much better for comparing cheapest days to fly and recommending best flights balancing times and cost
2022,5,great prices at times would like members discount but always use.
2022,1,"It's a spam app, just woo people for discounts but all in vain."
2019,5,it helps to safe time to check on the price. this app will direct you the best offer u can give from which site.
2018,5,User friendly app to search for best value flight.
2020,5,"However, I dont like the new icon. Looks like other popular travel apps (there's always something to mean about hey?)"
2022,1,Why making it that hard to find a deal in tge app version? And explore everywhere is not working anymore
2019,5,"Good app, works well for flights and cars"
2020,1,"Skyscanner is a fraud company supporting a Fraud Company named Gate1.ca to book tickets, dont use skyscanner and be a victim for fraud as i lost $1000 Dollars ! I'm going to launch a campaign to raise awareness about this Fraud Company in the States and Canada so that they dont cheat more people."

2019,4,"very helpful, still some flights are not in chart"
2021,1,"Please update the programm to the old version, it was much more better (interface)"
2018,5,This app opens a whole world of travel as it makes possible travel I thought impossible.

They should make it clear that many flights aren't included in the search! Waste of time! Why there is still no option for return to the same airport for those using car park?! So annoying!

2023,5,"I found the app to be quite useful for providing affordable prices. However, a frustrating aspect is that when you select an option, it redirects you to a different website that requires you to input all your details again and sign up. It would be more convenient if the app could seamlessly transfer the information you provided to this external platform using the same ID you created within the app. Overall, it's a good app, but this improvement would enhance the user experience."

2023,2,"I don't want to save all my personal details with you. I loved that I could just quickly check an airfare and, if I was ready to book, click through to get my ticket. That now all takes longer. I have also noticed alarming errors in my searches. Flights from BKK to SEAsia locations are coming up at many hundreds of pounds. They are all around ¬£ 50-70, but not with Skyscanner!"

2023,3,"Pese a que la aplicaci√≥n da opciones considerablemente econ√≥micas me parece un poco triste que las opciones de filtros sean tan limitadas. Ser√≠a genial que pusieran la opci√≥n de elegir a qu√© aeropuertos NO hacer escalas, por ejemplo el caso de los aeropuertos de USA donde much√≠simos vuelos hacen escala pero algunas personas no pueden porque no tienen visa. Filtrar la informaci√≥n sin esa opci√≥n es una odisea."

2023,2,"I used to use Skyscanner all the time but unfortunately the results for now no longer reliable. The initial price proposed for a trip is never the final price, rather, the final price is often significantly higher. I have stopped using Skyscanner and use Google flights because it is accurate."

2023,1,The app is one huge scam. The price that is show jumps 500$ upwards the moment you try to select a provider.
2023,2,Has had bugs recently. For example when trying to amend the date in search it will refuse to do so and only display whatever date was previously entered in.
2023,5,amat membantu dalam mendapatkan maklumat dah harga yang terendah.. sangat disarankan

If you were initially in the ""everywhere"" search mode, press on a destination, you don't like this option and press back, you are thrown to the beginning (top) of the list, not where you left to see the deal.

2022,1,My last review for this app was in 2019 and I rated it 3 stars because it had lost a lot of functionality. Now it's 1 star because it has lost even more. I can no longer easily see which direct flights there are between airports of my choosing to check which dates are cheaper. I'll be uninstalling this app as it is near useless nowadays. It's a shame the team at Skyscanner thought it would be great to completely trash a good system. The dev response isn't good enough. Can't search entire months

The world is opening. People are making flight reservations. Do you have plans to make the app useful again? Because there is no reason currently why I would be compelled to use this app over any other flight booking app. The new version is awful and if you don't go back to the way it was, I'm uninstalling."

2021,1,"Updated my previous review from 5 to 1 star only because it's pretty much unusable now. I used to love this app and use very very often, but after the last update it's simply horrible! Will wait a little bit to see if anything changes because I was really happy with it before, and was recommending it to everyone, but if it stays like that, I will look for another app that does the same thing in a much more effective way. Such a shame! Why ruin such a great app ?"
2021,1,"The latest update messed up again the user interface. This seems to be a similar problem I had with an update back in 2016, which has been fixed subsequently. Basicaly after the first time you search flights the user interface changes and you get an interface which is unusable. Update 7/2 It to a still much worse than it was before they starting to mess up. Sorry I go elsewhere until you get it."
2021,1,"New version sucks balls UPDATE: Die neue Version macht so gar keinen Spa√ü mehr. Es ist einfach alles komplizierter und umst√§ndlicher geworden. Total un√ºbersichtlich pl√∂tzlich. Man muss drei Mal hin und her skippen um Datum, Abflugort und Zielort √§ndern zu k√∂nnen. Wie hirnrissig ist das bitte?! Es ist als h√§tte sich jemand √ºberlegt: ""Wie mache ich diese App so richtig nervig?"" Falls das das Ziel war, ist es gelungen."
2021,2,What on earth have you done to the app? Impossible to use now. Cannot select one way flights or amend search dates. Perhaps as almost no one is flying at the moment you don't care that the app is broken..

2021,1,"Please remove the latest update it's very hard to navigate and difficult to find what you want, I am definitely uninstalling this app if this mess continues. Update; I finally decided to uninstall this app after years of being the best flight booking app but now with the new weird update it's no good Goodbye"
2021,1,I looked everywhere in the app for a multicity option but can't find it. Is it just clumsy me? Edit: 18 months later still no multicity search option in app. Edit. Wow! Haven't used the app all year because of the pandemic. It. Is. Awful.
2021,3,La nueva versi√≥n de Skyscanner deber√≠a mejorar bastante. No puedes acceder directamente al buscador de vuelos entre ciudades y no me carga el calendario con vuelos directos y precios. Tampoco dan la opci√≥n en muchas b√∫squedas a hacer la compra directamente con la aerol√≠nea(s). El icono de algunas aerol√≠neas c√≥mo Ryanair tambi√©n lleva mucho tiempo sin aparecer. Espero que en las pr√≥ximas actualizaciones arreglen esos problemas
2021,2,New app doesnt let me choose the destination as it only gives me flights for the place i searched before.. I cannot delete it and cannot choose another destination..
2021,1,"Latest version is really bad üëé. I couldn't use it at all. Please, we want old version of Skyscanner otherwise we all gonna delete it."
2021,1,The new UI has made the app difficult to use. Please revert the change.

UPD: features I like most do not exist in the app anymore, including flexible search and table with dates and prices for finding best options. Or I can't find it with a new layout. Either way I must downgrade my previous rate"
2020,1,"How to go from five to one star by destroying everything? See and learn from Skyscanner. This used to be such a great app, could very well just stay the way it was for always, but no, somebody got the idea and the opportunity to mess it up... Hey Skyscanner, did you give the update job to your competitors or what?"
2021,1,Row upon row of detailed one star reviews and you ask what's wrong! Bring back the old great format. Used to be my favourite flight app; now clunky and confusing. Why make it worse? 5 stars to 1 star.
2021,5,"No price show with dates, not easy to find search options for airports, very difficult üòíNow it becomes a rubbish app with last update. It was rated long ago! (The best app! Excellent performance for flight searching.)"
2021,2,Old App - Nothing more to say. Great app! Simple! 5* New Version - Search facility is just terrible. Really painful to use. Who thought this was a good idea? Did you do any UX Research with average users?
2021,1,"The new version of this app remove great features the previous app had: can no longer search a whole month with calendar of prices, search criteria now split in 4 different screens when it used to be one, no more flexible dates. I used to be the biggest fan, will no longer use this app."
2020,1,"Latestupdate appears to have reduced the functionality, such as now not being able to seach to 'anywhere'. Why would you take features away when it worked well before?"
2020,4,Edit: I've persevered with it and can now do what I need - has just taken me a while to get used to it. Love it. Have used this app for years although I don't necessarily book through it.
2020,1,Change in flight search interface is very poor. Not user friendly at all. Why to fix something working perfectly??
2021,2,This app has changed for the worst! Simple search for flights is now so complicated I can't follow it!
2020,1,The old system was great.. but now I can see the best date is cheaper i have to search manually day by day ... please bring it back..

2020,5,Great app booked many many trips with this Since new version has appeared finding it hard work go back to the old version
2020,4,Overall I'm quite happy with the app but I wish that the everywhere/all destinations search that works perfectly on the skyscanner website would also work in the app
2021,1,Used to be good app. Now it's not user friendly
2021,2,I have downgraded from 4 stars to two because this updated version has removed vef the monthly view that was the main reason for us using the app.

2020,1,This app is currently of no value without the month overview/daily price. Why do you think people were using your app? It's now easier and quicker to look at individual airlines' apps. I've uninstalled.

2020,5,"The app works perfectly. For those experiencing changing updates remember it is nothing to do with the app. The company as all others have no control over flight companies, restrictions, changes in timetables etc. I have took hundreds of flights with this app and it NEVER let me down."
2020,1,New update is horrible - seems to be more focused in pushing hotels than doing fast searches for flights
2020,1,I strongly dislike the changes they have made recently in the app. It used to be easier to find good prices in a range of dates the way it was before. A pity... Update: I am tapping on the dates box but the whole month option will not appear...
2020,1,Worst update ever. Who even comes up with these ideas. Is it just to keep you busy. Searching for flights is made even more of a headache now. Why change something that works

2020,5,"""Everywhere"" option extremely practical, it would be nice to set also the departure from ""everywhere"" (to a specific place). What makes this site the first on my list is the possibility to easily and graphical see in the whole year/month when you have the cheapest prices. FEEDBACK: Please make: train research, as you know, high speed trains are Eco friendly and can be even faster than airplanes. Add Airbnb, vrbo, housing anywhere etc. / Add 'everywhere' option for accommodation too."

2020,3,I have been using this app since 2015 for all of my international flight searches. I used to save multiple searches with alerts . All alerts were shown on the front screen showing the price change in front of each alert. Now it only show 3 alerts with no price display.

This new update makes it hard to scroll and look at saved flights. Needs an option to remove the watched flights, as it takes up too much room on the screen. Need an option to be able to clear history like in previous updates"
2019,1,"This app is still a poor replacement for the actual website. From the search menu you cannot choose month instead of a day You can't easily choose destination as everywhere. Previously It was possible to quickly choose routes, month and the everywhere function. And then see a calendar or chart with all the options. Now we have pretty pictures and a horrible frustrating experience. Once a year I download the app, see if its improved. But as at December 2019, it's still a poor copy of the site"

2019,1,"Since the update, it's got so confusing and a lot worse. This phrase springs to mind ""if it's not broken, don't fu*king fix it"". Any chance we can have a choice of having the old 5* Skyscanner back rather than this ""downdated"" version? Or will you be sticking your middle finger at loyal customers like myself? It's such a shame you'll be forcing me to go somewhere else considering I've used you guys from the beginning."

2019,4,It's great application but you need to improve 2 points 1- when I decide to travel out of my country to another destination you should provide filter for direct flights to selected city 2- If I select economy class you should mention clearly the weight for bags since sometimes after booking I had been surprised by baggage allowance

2019,5,Great app has never let me down finding the cheap flights I want recommend it to all and the widget always updating every hour keeping me up with all flights. Just one more question why haven't you updated this and reapplied the widget as the widget was very handy to have
2019,5,"(1) Includes all economical flights, (2) V4.15 contains all features needed [ one way, two way, monthly chart ] .... Will be ultimate if u say the price below each date (may be too much to ask for, but that would me final expectation from this app :-) ) Updated feedback on 4-Sep-2019: One bug: V5.75.1: Filter by ""AirAsia"" airlines shows empty list, may be a problem with ""AirAsia"" / ""Thai AirAsia""."
2019,5,Always my go to app for comparing flight prices. Intuitive to use

2019,2,the new update for explore (everywhere) messed things up!! when clicking on a ticket it says from (price) you enter and cant find it.
2019,4,Cheapest flights to be found on here but be careful of Travelgenio...prices on their site can change quickly even while you are booking
2019,1,The filters work HORRIBLY. COME ON ALREADY. And the feedback form doesn't work. What else can you screw up?
2019,3,previously I was able to choose only direct flight and see which days are cheap... now no...
2019,4,Good. Having trouble with multi location. Other than it's good.
2019,4,Very useful. Sometimes there are some cheap flights missing.
2019,5,Best flight app. Used for years.

2019,1,"Oh what have you done? This new version is no match for the previous version. The navigation is cumbersome and unnecessary. Who on earth makes these decisions to change things? I will be uninstalling and hopefully will find an apk of the previous version. You ask what could be done. Stop making these unnecessary changes and bring back the previous version, which is what i am now running."
2019,2,Was an excellent 5 star app which I have used all the time over the last five years. Sadly it has becomes much less user friendly and slow 2 start app after the latest update.
2019,5,Excellent app. Must have if you travel a lot
2019,5,"Easy to use, great range of filters and options to narrow down results"
2019,5,"Primeira vez que uso, primeira reserva de passagens feita, foi r√°pido e eficiente, por enquanto nado do que reclamar."

2019,1,"Frustrating, unusable. Ive used Skyscanner for years. Always my goto site for flights. Tried to book a flight today and the experience was awful. I understand that you need to generate an income from my visit, but Ive just given up and will do a manual search - or use a rival instead. So sad to see."

2019,5,Working with the app for a while and it's fine really like it... I think they have the best offers

2019,2,"you need to put pressure on your partners . booked with gogagte.ie but ticket increased by 25.41 at payment done. because i selected visa credit card. there was no pop up, no notice nothing. and i have to dig in after booking to find out how the hell price went up."
2019,3,5* to 3*. App acknowledges muti person searches but then shows price for single person. Not as transparent as previously used. Will stick to website
2019,4,multi city included now and great! any way of the flight search including nearby airports?
2019,4,"Tenen muchas opciones y muchos precios para el mismo destino .. es facil de usar y puedes configurar idioma, precios y otras cosas. Aunque constantemente esta actualizando los precios si dejas pasar mucho tiempo la recomiendo.."
2019,1,"Its become sluggish, useless, without price indications, hard to navigate am disappointed I just uninstall the app after 5 years of using a perfect app"
2019,5,I always use Skyscanner app when I have to book flights. very practical and user friendly
2019,5,Its one of the most best app of playstore. recommended for professional travels.
2019,5,What's i am finding...  Perfectly work...  Best
2019,5,"Really like skyscanner, it can help me to find cheapest ‚úà ticketsüëç"
2019,5,super se bhi upaar app hai fast and user friendly
2019,5,Gud application but if it got payment option it will be better
2019,5,What happened with the option to book train tickets? I can't see it anymore.
2019,5,NICE 1 very use full app...

2019,5,"PERFECT! The most amazing thing about it is that, unlike most booking apps, this one ACTUALLY provides you with the lowest rates available and that's pretty much what I need. The interface is nice and user friendly, the app doesn't lag or crash at all, it's INCREDIBLY reliable. Thank you, Skyscanner! Please continue to get better, don't lose this outstanding quality and performance as time passes."
2019,5,Friends keep on introducing me to new apps but l still prefer Skyscanner especially when i switch to take me EVERYWHERE. Its a smart way to travel. Skyscanner is user friendly and less time consuming. Thanks guys i hope you dont do some kind of an upgrade that could wreck my nerves.

2019,4,"Now it's much better than a year ago,still I would like to see the explore on the map. My 2017 review ""The old version was the best travel search application. Unfortunately i am not using Skyscanner anymore, there are other much better options."""
2019,4,"I've used Skyscanner for a long while now and have found numerous excellent international & domestic fares on the site. However, recently the app continually crashes as soon as it is opened. Uninstalling and reinstalling it temporarily fixes it, but after a short while it simply refuses to open. Maybe it's an android or Samsung issue, but it's a pain having to repeatedly uninstall and reinstall. That said, it's still the best app for flight searches worldwide."
2019,5,Skyscanner is my number one go to app for flight comparisons. Love it. 3 years on and still using it regularly.
2019,3,"UK doesn't charge taxes (or something) for ages 15 and under but the app is not asking for ages. ***Update*** nothing still done for UK users, it's been 8 months."

2019,2,"After a long time I gave Skyscanner another try. I installed it on my primary phone, running Android 9, only to find that I could not install it on my secondary phone, a OnePlus One running Android 8 (LineageOS). On that phone the app does not appear in the Play Store and shows as incompatible on the Play Store web site. I cannot think of any good reason for that."

2019,3,three stars now previous problem sorted . However very frustrating when searching flights knowing if check baggage is included. often once into final booking phase you are told that there is not any checked baggage booked and no options to include it. Please add a filter so only flights with checked baggage are showing
2019,3,"The app is working again now, but there are no widgets available for me anymore? The best and unique feature with this app was the ability to monitor best price for a destination and month on the widget!"
2019,5,"Especially good if you are open to where you want to go. Can do great queries from a given airport to a target country, and then price degradation over time"
2019,4,After a blip Skyscanner is once again more usable. A quick way to hunt down cheap flights

2019,1,"I'm surprised of how worse the new updates get and keep going. Often the selected dates just change when I press search. Prices for destinations are nowhere near the first value. You select a destination, it tells you the price and then it doesn't find any flights. Or it says it doesn't find enough tickets: 1. Come on!? Skyscanner was so much better before the restyle üò£üòî"

2019,3,"I have been using another fare finder and have found it to be better at finding much cheaper prices some fares that Sky scanner dont list, I use both though just to make sure I get the best air fares. it's been over 18 months since my last review. have noticed that a lot of prices being shown on Skyscanner are from companies that have less than favorable reviews , might be a good idea to remove these companies and have minumum ratings instead of listing them so to help keep the rogues out."
2019,4,"no longer able to select ""whole month"" under the ""Select dates"" section but there is no this issue with the web version. so please help resolve this issue the soonest possible on this app, if possible within 3 days. thanks"
2023,1,"Absolute useless and lying app. Top deals section is a scam! Useless, disgusting, misleading, total failure!!!! Absolutely disgrace! Faulty prices! I would have given 0 if I coulda"
2019,5,Very happy with the results.. find a flight to and from Paris around $300 cheaper than what I had been able to find on my own putting in a lot of time.. app did it in seconds
2018,1,This entire site is a scam. Do not trust it! when you click on the links to buy tickets the tickets don't exist or the prices change. This is a constant issue. Go the the airline website. Don't trust skyscanner!!!
2019,5,AWESOME.... Never knew I'd get such a clean properly working real time app.... Thank you developers!!!

2018,1,"Sad. That widget is no longer available. Update: Thank you for your reponse. Afterit, i think its time to uninstall skyscanner. Because widget was the way i was using it. If i need to go inside the app to check the flights. I will better use google flights."
2018,4,Wonderful app!!! In my opinion the only part missing is it doesn't provide info whether the flight booking is refundable or not.
2018,5,"Easy to use and intuitive app, aggregating all major airlines and ticket websites."
2018,5,Very useful I cant travel without skysc aner
2018,5,"Inaccurate, no point in searching and getting a higher price further down the process."

2018,1,Maybe the devs can explain this to me. What's the point of a price alert minus the filters I set it to? For instance yes $50 less is great but minus my filters that $50 less if I take a flight with two extra stops making my trip almost 24 hours total...meaning the alert is useles to me since I won't take that. Nobody would. I don't know if this is a bug or bad programming or deliberate or what.

2018,1,"Hello, just tried again on 7 October 2018. Still no search by month rather than specific date. Either this obviously useful feature isn't there or it's really well hidden. Have uninstalled the app straightaway again. Update on 13 Nov 2017. Still really difficult to use compared with the website. Update on 21 May 2017. Thought I'd give it another go but... oh dear! Can't find how to search flights by month rather than specific date. Function is either not available or not immediately obvious. What's going on? Previous review: used to love this App. But all the useful functionality has been removed. I really don't understand why. I can only hope that a future version reverts to the previous approach and includes the excellent day-by-day comparisons and the super flexible date and airport search features which have been deleted. I feel like I've lost an old friend. I've asked friends to suggest other search sites and will use one of those. Big thumbs down from me, sorry"
2018,5,I love travel I am extremely happy the ability to manage all of trip with this app
2018,5,Convenient for planning a trip. Great work!
2018,5,The best app to search the lowest prices for flights.
2018,1,"Big scam, they show low prices and when click on it the price doubled or tripled üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº"
2018,5,"Hate it, used to be simple and great to use. Now totally confusing and unclear."

2018,1,"I reviewed you guys on the 16th of May 2018, i had nothing to write because I was happy with the service you provided. All the cheapest air fares from different agents under 1 roof that was awesome, i guess ignorance bliss i should have done a bit more research before purchasing my tickets from Tripsta which i did on 17th of May 2018 for a trip which i was travelling with my wife on the 22nd Aug 2018 from DXB to HRE, return flights on the 2nd Sept 2018 HRE to DXB . To cut a long story short we get to the check in desk of the airline and we told the tickets have been suspended by the agent Tripsta due to none payment this is an hour before boarding, I was shocked after hearing that i asked to see the supervisor, he said the same thing and he even took it a little further by asking us to come round the check in counter to show us on the system. We showed him all our emails from Tripsta and even a e'statement from the bank showing the online payment made plus the ticket sale receipt. I was advised to call the Tripsta toll free number which i did and it was fruitless it didn't even go through, I even had to call my Uncle in the wee hours of the morning based in UK to call the Tripsta toll free since its UK based agent and it didn't even go through to make it worse it gave us an alternative spanish number which didn't even go through. It was disheartening when We googled Tripsta and seeing all these bad review's about them, we had been planned for this 8 months in advance, so realising nothing could be done we ended up buying tickets from another agent at the airport which was expensive and we couldn't cancel our plans to go on holiday. We basically bought tickets twice and 1 set we didn't use due to we got scammed and used the other. So once we got back we tried contacting Tripsta asking for a refund and it was the same tune, no response from them. Isn't there a way to remove any of these fraudulent agents from your site or app because at the moment i wouldn't advise anyone who may ask me for my opinion to use your app. After a stream of bad reviews why do you still keep them on your App."
2018,3,"good concept for an app. nut it needs more development. it states that there's a ""star"" option, but i didn't see one . hence if im intersted in somethimg i need to screen shot it,and redo the search. Add more filters such as price, airline,flight times, stop over times.it would also be useful to know what the websites involved charge as a booking or admin fee for using those sites"
2018,3,app is Ok. But many thinks need to improve.. its so annoying that many long flights with lot of transits include are not listed by price in month.. simple not showing you cheap dills in calendar.. so to find cheap option for such a trips you need to search manual.. because for little complicate flights like that are not showing any cheap options.. so you need to searching day by day manually to see best dills..
2018,3,Skyscanner is the flight search engine of my choice. I'm using the (mobile) website though because the app is just not intuitive at all. For example you can not go through the days with one click. I also find the layout quite disorganized.
2018,4,"Not bad, but until it can show the whole month with prices, like on web page, it's not very useful. +star for quick feedback. Keep dev active!"
2018,5,"I've used many travel apps. This gives the best prices, easy to use, keeps you updated if prices change. Love it"
2018,5,My favorite app when comes to flights comparison. Very useful tips in explore tab. Keep up the good work!
2018,5,I'm sitting in South Africa and I'm looking for a app than can give me cheapest flights in the US. I remember that you guys sponsored a flight on the YesTheory youtube channel. Well done
2018,4,Pls add feature to book tour with hotel and flight and taxi all in one. Also show lowest fare month or date for travelling
2018,4,"I like it ,nice and cheap flights but I would like if you could have the option to use the prices of every day of the month at once"
2018,4,Absolutely love the app. Would be great to have the option of selecting different flight options in a multi trip setting.
2018,4,Good App to compare the flights with different sites also has features like price watch & getting intimation while price change
2018,4,To be sad only selected airlines inside. And i can't find the button for flight price alert in apps
2018,5,"Efficent, efective and reliable app to find best price, best route, best time for traveling. I use Skyscanner almost ten years"
2018,5,"I always use skyscanner to find the cheapest flights. The app is a tiny bit less easy to navigate than the website, but it's still the best way to find the best flight."
2018,4,A very helpful app and simple to use. Great work. Thanks. Compliments üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ
2018,3,OK so far. Would be nice to get price alert on specific dates and times.
2018,5,Excellent app for finding the best flight. Better than most of the apps out there
2018,4,Good interface with information about what's on the flight regarding comforts and of a meals included etc.
2018,1,This app sucks. It doesnt even remember my home airport. Stupid.
2018,5,Found a great deal to Rome in June. Alerts you when they price changes.
2018,5,Great to check best flights. Better then all the other apps
2018,4,Ease of use. Excellent to compare prices.

2018,3,"Good app that was better. Simple feature missing that would save significant amounts of time, including server time, is to default to flying out and returning to the same airport, especially for people in the south east who may have a choice of up to 7 airports. Bracketing the sliders would also help to cut down search time."
2018,5,"Heck yes, multi city! Planned my trip to Europe using this, and it was so easy and just the little extra features like having recent searches pop up when adding legs, or not deleting everything when you go back to home page so you can just adjust one part to see if the price changes rather than resubmit everything... THE BEST! Thank you for the update!"
2018,3,Nice app but why you have coloured price categories and not the actual values like the desktop version? It's very annoying! Thank you
2018,3,It's a good search engine bit why don't they offer multi leg flight search on the app? Without this I always have to go back to the mobile website version
2018,5,Easy to use. You have different filters that can help you find what you are looking for easily. I've use it to buy to buy flight tickets several times and never had any problem.
2018,1,I am color blindness. You use the colors are red and green. I cannot notice which is a price on the calendar. please change the colors into shape.
2018,4,Some of the shops it sends you to to buy tickets seem a bit dodgy doing things like automatically adding insurance products you didn't ask for. Would be nice if Skyscanner vetted them and didn't allow that kind of thing.
2018,4,I like the fact that it compares all companies out there to find the cheapest deal. Best app I have used so far!
2018,5,Great app. I have found several great deals with Skyscanner. Highly recommend!
2018,5,"Great, useful and beautiful app. love skyscanner, always gives you the best price."
2018,4,Excellent app. Better add all airport arrival and departure flight details.
2018,4,Havent bought a ticket yet on here.... but thr displayed deals seem appealing

2018,5,Great app. Always gets best price on flights.
2018,5,Awesome...swear by it. Use it EVERYTIME I need travel
2018,4,"Lack of calendar function, flexible dates, no flight rules, cannot filter flights with 1 stop."
2018,5,Very good app. Very economical. I love this app. It's really awesome.
2018,4,Pretty straight forward and I use it frequently. What I would like to see is that the filter come forward before the first search.
2018,2,Not as good as the desktop version. Wasn't worth the hassle.
2018,5,Easy to use. Best prices by far
2018,5,Well for me as a frequent traveller very useful coz of detailed flights and the part is it's more cheaper than the other app.

2018,5,It's a great app to use to at least get an idea of how cheap flights can be!
2019,4,quite easy to use. many airlines in this app.
2018,5,Love this app has flights I couldn't find on Expedia.
2018,5,Very useful app for checking air & hotel fares in best rates.
2018,4,"Tickets price on here is not always right, you only what you are paying when you are making your final booking payment."
2018,5,"Great app, I always use it whenever I travel."
2018,5,Great app enabling you to find bargain flights :)

2018,2,I used to love the app but recently the prices shown on search are much lower than the actual price of the flight. I just searched explore Spain and it has shown me the price ¬£39 return but when I clicked on it the lowest price was ¬£78 for now and the next three months. It makes the app useless. Please fix this and I will give 5 star. Thank you!
2018,2,"other flight search services allow you to check a baggage required box... 
this app has no such feature so your left to get to the end of the process 
- purchase a ticket before you find out baggage is NOT included in the 
fare... has caught me out a few times already - very good app but for this 
stupid anomoly"
2018,4,"Best flight search app. Very easy and comfortable. Yet i""m getting this 
message: no flight prices every time i use the app and have to close and 
oppen several times to make it work again. Please check it out its a bug. 
Also the prices colors doesn't show up on the calendar when searching a 
flight."
2018,2,"Used to be able to search by price (if you wanted to go ""anywhere"" for a 
period) - dont appear to be able to do that anymore, keeps showing 
alphabetical list of places which means you have to go through each one in 
order rather than looking at locations within a budget range. For me that 
was the main use case for this app."
2018,5,"Always check my tickets, car rental and hotel's here. I sudgest when searching for a roundtrip it should show the cheapest price combining trips with different airline instead giving you roundtrips with the same airline. For me its easier search for one way and get the cheapest price with diferents airlines paying less than the result that the app give you, tickets with the same company airlines. Should be a good upgrade. Its still a good app."
2018,4,"Very nice interface, lower price than Kayak. Nice filters. 1 star off for 
not being able to set alert on multiple cities flight search, or star üåüa 
flight, athough the front page suggested that it's possible."
2018,1,"I previously gave 1 star, i am upgrading you to 5 stars because of your 
quick response on here and as well when I submitted the tech support 
ticket. Today I used your app and I was able to get my tickets and family 
so I'm good. I'd use your app again in the future"
2018,4,"Skyscanner application is very good to find cheaper airlines. But few 
booking agents are applying hidden charges just before the payment. They 
just show cheap tickets to attract users and it is annoying."
2018,5,"Love this app. Use it for all my flight plans. Also love using the ""explore"" option to see where I could possibly jet off to next for a decent sum of money :D"
2018,5,"I am in love with this app! It is amazing and so useful! Shows you all the 
cheapest flights around the world and is such a time and money saver! 100% 
recommend this app! Trust me, you won't be disappointed."
2018,5,"I wonder why I just install now.. not a typical who writes a review. But 
this app is really worth it. It would be even great if they have detail 
about the ticket flight like baggage allowance"
2018,5,"I love the fact that you are able to find great deals. This App does it all! No more searching on Priceline, Cheap tickets, Expedia, etc. Highly recommended!"
2018,2,"I want to change my profile, but it does allows while I don't record a 
flight to monitor. Frustrating. Uninstalling."
2018,3,"Are all the sites that show up while searching flights genuine & Skyscanner 
guarantees of no booking issue. The app is excellent as to know the 
airfares from different sites in one place."
2018,5,"I love this app! Clean, fresh and easy to use and most importantly it 
helped me get the best deals on flights on multiple occasions! A definite 
must have"
2018,1,"Skyscanner developers, what happened ?? I have been using this app for many 
years but recently 99% of the prices are not accurate. Looking for the best 
possible connection and price only to find out (after you have been 
transfered to another site) that the pricing is off sometimes by 100's of 
dollars is a complete waste of time."
2018,5,"Skyscanner is my first and 90% of the time my only app for searching for 
flights. I carried out an extensive comparison exercise recently and it 
consistently was the fastest and some of the searches found the cheapest 
fare."
2018,4,"Excellent to compare flight prices and find the best offers! Love the tool 
of month searches as well as whole country tickets prices view."
2018,5,"Great service for comparing sites, love it, app is super useful. Better than a travel agent if you are a bit savvy."
2018,5,"Good apps, work fast and so many airplanes n flights to choose from and 
very competitive prices.. happy with it"
2018,5,"First time I've bought a ticket via Skyscanner. Initially I was confused. 
But now I'm satisfied. I don't know why people have had bad experience but 
I recommend this app."
2018,5,Absolutely brilliant. The developers of this app did a massive favour for me. Thank you very much.
2018,5,Love Sky Scanner and I will DEFINITELY be using it to book my next 2 trips! Thank you so much!
2018,4,"Latest version with horizontal and not vertical as before is the worst of 
the worst (worst than the new IG logo). What an unnecessary change"
2018,5,It's a great app! I book all of my travel plans here. I love it!
2018,5,"My go to app for booking flights. Easy to use, love the month view, very 
cool!"
2018,4,I change the rate to 4 stars because finally they allowed to search for Multi-City flight. Thanks...
2018,5,"Pretty cool little app. Love that you can keep an eye on price changes so 
easily!"
2018,5,I use this app to find all my flights! Always gives me the best amd cheapest options.

pricing."

want, fuss free and efficient"
2018,5,"This is AMAZING! Very easy to understand and navigate through and saves 
time like no other! Love it"
2018,2,"I have been using it for very long time but now I'm so disappointed the 
price are showing on your website is half the price on a car rental actual 
website"

2018,5,Cheap flights
2018,4,"So useful, it's a great app and saves lots of time searching for the 
cheapest flights, my only suggestion is that it would be even better if 
when searching for multiple flights (returns or multi-city) we could have a 
sort of ""pic'n'mix"" option so you can pick which flights your want and put 
them together. It gets a bit confusing trying to find the right combination 
otherwise."
2018,5,"This app is really useful, and easy to understand. It has been more 
effective and efficient than many other sites I've tried. If you're looking 
for a flight I'd recommend using Skyscanner"
2018,5,"Really liked the app for its convenience. Prices are a bit misleading when 
you actually get to the final booking as a few other costs add up. Very 
convenient though for planning a holiday. Good job :)"
2018,5,"Great app. But would be better if you could search for air fare from one 
COUNTRY to another COUNTRY (find the cheapest flights between two 
countries). :-)"
2018,4,"Really convenient on the go. Or for spontanious trips. Love the option of 
searching for flight to any destination from a defined airport. √ôse it for 
90% of my flights."
2018,1,"Most of the times the flight price is not valid. I can't trust this app for 
booking. They try to show cheap price to increase their search viewer"
2018,5,"I use it all the time since a few years. The graphs with the prices let you 
chose the cheapest day to travel. My favourite function."
2018,5,"Great for last minute bookings and comparisons. Booked flights while having 
breakfast on phone couple of hours before flying. Fantastic"
2018,5,"At last! Multi-city flight searches available on the app rather than having 
to fire-up my laptop. Great stuff."
2018,4,"Been using the version for computers but I found that the app is actually 
handier. Of course one may always ask for more but it is performing what 
expected and this is what makes it great."
2018,5,"I love it! Lower and better prices than Hopper. Also looks at flights 
further out!!"
2018,4,The previous version is better for me. Just flight booking. Simple
2018,5,"It's really easy to use with all the features I needed to compare prices 
and alert me of price changes."
2018,5,This app really helpful & has a lot of feature. Most important its user friendly.
2018,4,"Why doesn't it show the map like the web version? How is scanning hundreds 
of tiles better?"
2018,5,"love the feature of browsing All destinations by budget. The explore option 
won my heart"
2018,2,"This app show only non direct flights, when clearly is direct flights. Why 
so!!!!! Can you fix this nonsense, please!!!!!!"
2018,4,Useful as guiding flight tix prices without tax only
2018,5,Great app. I'm using this everytime i book a flight.
2018,5,"Work amazingly found really cheap flights that where twice the price on 
other websites."
2018,3,"Why does this app not have to select cheapest month like its web page... I 
think web page is better than this app.."
2018,5,Used it for my trips in east Asia and in France. Really good app
2018,5,"Very good app, very useful to plan a trip. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2018,5,This app gives you the best prices on flights and rental cars.
2018,5,Excellent interface but need to add some features.
2018,1,"P√©simo servicio, cobros extra inesperados, no te compensan por sis fallas 
t√©cnicas ni te dan soluci√≥n."
2018,4,Love how it compares prices. Very convenien5
2018,5,Nice apt app to search for relevant flights and hotel
2018,4,"Good app, but I can't seem to be able to remove price tracker from the app 
itself."
2018,5,"Well, whoever came up with an idea of this app is a life and money saver. 
Keep up the great work."
2018,5,"Glad to finally get multi city support. It'll be useful to get a 3 day 
comparison of fares for people who's dates are flexible."
2018,4,"Looks good, but I've only used this app for a short time so far."
2018,5,Perfect app. Does what all those other sites only claim to be able to do.
2018,5,"Reliable, fast and simple to use. Can be crowned as an ultimate king in air 
ticket booking."
2018,5,"It does what I need, easy to use and saves me money. No complaints."
2018,5,Very useful. But somtimes there's high extra fee like deposit
2018,4,"Works very well, haven't had any problems yet."
2018,4,Great for seeing options for my next trip...
2018,4,"Great app, saves lots of time."
2018,5,"Great app, usually cheaper flights than other apps I've used."
2018,5,"Awesome app..shows you cheapest flight without wasting time..kudos to 
Skyscanner team..you guys rockü§òü§ò"
2018,5,"Brilliant! Quick access to all travel, scheduled and serendipity"
2018,5,Very impressive app. It helps me to save some bucks.
2018,5,"Used this app for years, all great trips start with Skyscanner as far as 
I'm concerned."
2018,5,Easy to use and that find the cheapest flights I've ever seen!!
2018,5,"Best prices always,no hidden costs."
2018,5,"i love this app beats every other app for its simplicity and so easy to 
navigate brilliant"
2018,5,"You will definitely get the cheapest, best customized flight!!"
2018,5,"All comparison been accurate so far, keep it up."
2018,5,It think this is a very good app but sometimes it cost too much

2018,2,"No ability to add nearby airports. That's a really unreliable feature on 
the website anyway as its definition of nearby airports is poor - doesn't 
include East Midlands when I search for Birmingham nor Girona and Reus when 
I search for Barcelona. Maybe you need to add a human touch to bring some 
common sense to your algorithm. Can't search by whole month. Hard to change 
search from the same screen. Prices are often out of date."
2018,1,"For some reason you force enable camera permission, and when I restrict my 
camera via lens cap, then the app cannot function. The only instance this 
would be necessary is for spying, so please can you clarify why? No other 
app that I have ever used apart from my camera app needs that enabled by 
administrator? Fishy to say the least."
2018,5,"Amazing appusing since its birth! But now getting very complicated for user 
on mobile. Specially I cannot simply select the whole month to compare 
flight fare. Its very difficult to find the option of whole month or 
cheapest fare. I am using the app on galaxy note 8. Its easier and simple 
to search on webside but on this app I dont know how to search cheapest 
month or yearly month view thats why I uninstalled and use web."
2018,4,"A very good and helpful app afterall, but there's a minor problem, once a 
flight is added to the ""trips"", it cannot be deleted or changed? I 
accidentally added the flight on a wrong date and it cannot be changed 
since. Very minor problem, but it kinda annoys me a lil bit. *Update: the 
bug is fixed!!"
2018,1,"Waste of time downloading this app. I got it because i thought i'd be able to get flight alerts, but although that is promised there seems to be no way to save searches. Uninstalled within 20 minutes."
2018,4,"I just downloaded the app. And it's nice that you can save and get price 
alerts. However, that's ONLY possible for round-trips and one ways. NOT on 
multiple flights. Could you please take a look at this? Thanks."
2018,3,"How can I remove old price alerts? Instead of trawling through a long list 
to get to the ones of most interest. Tried to untrack by unchecking the 
star but alert still remains! Email alerts are quicker and more convenient."
2018,5,"so far., very good. skyscanner compares tons of airlines and 
webdisites--more than other ones--and mixes and matches tickets well. buy 
tickets from individual websites or airlines directly from links. sometimes 
there are discounter websites who don't hold the promised pricesor the 
tickets are gone upon closer examination, but mostly accurate. able to 
compare costs on various dates. helpful searches for those with flexibility 
too."
2018,1,"The app flights filter doesn't filter by landing time, it doesn't work at 
all. It's a shame! Also prices are exactly like domestic ones."
2018,5,"Alright I realized how to select a month now I am an idiot. Only problem is 
there might be cheaper deals including train.. for the last stretch. My 
destination is kind of unusual"
2018,1,"The app never shows the flights. The list is empty and i tried many 
options. How is that possible? In the website i can see all the flights but 
the app can't find any. Uninstalling."
2018,4,"Skyscanner is my go to place to check flights, love that it's got the 
trains feature too! Hopefully it'll be improved soon, I'd love to see a 
month by month price calendar for trains just like the flights one."
2018,4,"I found the price in this app better than similar apps, however Some times 
for a same destination the app show different price in two different 
phones. I couldn't find the reason..."
2018,5,"Nine app. Love it , simplified yet aggregated view of flight fares. There 
is definitely a lot of scope on hotel search and car rentals though."
2018,5,"I found on this app very cheap flight ticket for Croatia I call travel 
agent to check and book the flight for me she thought I was drunk because 
she did not believe price. I was right and got the ticket same dayüòé"
2018,4,"The website is miles better and easier to search. Can't even search the  whole month..  Edit. It's working, but you need to select a specific airport. You can't just select a destination country like the website."
2018,5,"Its good for people who don't know much about booking flights domestic and 
international both. Good job scanners‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è keep it up."

price compare option."

each leg selection and improve to include domestic airlines"

version. Annoying"
2018,3,"There's no way to to choose which city I want to go through. For instance. 
I want to go to Australia via Honolulu, not Japan and there is no way to 
make that choice."

2018,3,"The Skyscanner website is amazing. I can find the cheapest the price almost 
every time. Some issues are with the android app. (the ios app works really 
well. ) 1. Why the recent searches and price alerts are in the same column? 
I suppose most people just want to check the price changes while seeing a 
load of random history searches. Not exaggerated, why the history from 
nearly one year ago shows up in the first ones? 2. Hopefully you can add 
the passport feature to Android version too."
2018,4,"Fantastic app I base 90% of my flights around it. But do be aware 
Skyscanner use cookies and watch your flights, so every time you re-check 
your flights they might bumb up the price. Use this app more for comparing 
your flights and try using incognito or look on a different device when 
booking and the prices should be cheaper."
2018,1,"WARNING PLEASE AVOID... IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM NOR DO THE SKYSCANNER HAVE A 
CONTACT OR MOST OF THERE AGENTS. IM STUCK! I WILL BE TAKING THEM TO COURT. 
PLEASE AVOID"
2018,4,"It compares Lots of travel sites I wouldn't have even known about. Only 
issue is that when I favorite a flight, it doesn't save. Otherwise, 
recommend app."
2018,2,"Prices are very outdated and now only shows the deals that have the 
greatest commission as the best fare. Better comparison apps around. A 
terrible fall from grace."
2018,5,"I used hopper as per recommendation by a friend who travels often and i was 
so glad i checked out skyscanner too because the prices were always much 
better. 100% recommend"
2018,5,"I always use this app when travelling. Finds me the best deals out there! 
Better than most other apps out there."
2018,1,"App is way overated. It doesn't find anything special, just the same 
flights any other site would"
2018,1,"After the update, it is not working. I did multiple times Captcha. However, 
it still not route me back to skyscanner."
2018,5,"The best app for a frequent traveler like me. Quite reliable information 
and makes the whole travel planning interesting be it for business or 
pleasure.."
2018,5,"Best app for booking flights. Only some agents should sent the downloads in 
.pdf file Not just pdf as it won't open on my mobile phone"
2018,2,"So hard to change flight info. Make a mistake, save it, try to change it. 
And, good luck trying to deleting it."
2018,2,"Frustrating to use. I enter dates to explore, then once I click on a 
destination it reverts to flights from all dates, NOT the dates I specified"
2018,5,"Has almost all airlines that one could think off. Wonder if there could be 
an additional option where one could choose different airlines for return 
flights."
2018,5,"This app is very comfortable and amazing. I can found the ticket for 
different city. Thanks"
2018,5,"So easy to find great deals on here. It's a must for anyone planning a 
holiday"

2018,4,Works well...gives good overview of prices and easy to use.
2018,5,Great app to track prices for flights when planning your trips.
2018,4,"It lets the cheapest flights from most airlines but it'll just redirect you 
and you're at the mercy of the website selling the said ticket."
2018,4,I am just wondering if Skyscanner has any customer support service?
2018,5,Love this app! Use it to find all my flights!
2018,4,"Doesn't cater all available airlines but is pretty useful if you want to 
stick to the mainstream airlines"
2018,5,Best feature is they give the info the aircraft.
2018,5,Great app. Always works as planned.
2018,5,Skyscanner has never let me down. I love this app and use it frequently.

if there's any hidden fees."

2018,2,"No multi-city search, really? Also the options to search with flexible  dates are very limited, not a great experience. Edit: reply to Omary from support. Regarding flexibility: If I am looking for a destination for aprox. the first two weeks of august, the map is useless as I can only get results for the whole of August. I should be able to specify dates and add a +/- of maybe 5 days. Now if instead of the map I use the normal search with anywhere as a destination, I have to use exact dates, and repeat the search for every combination of dates, so if, for instance, I am in search of a god deal for the first two or three weeks of august, I will have to painfully try every combiantion of dates to see what comes up (like from the 1st to the 16th, 2nd to 17th, 1st to 17th, etc, etc.) Glad you are adding multi-city, better late than never"
2018,1,"Long story short, disappointing... Shows you unavailable flights on the 
search results, only when you try booking it suddenly tells you the deal 
isn't available any more, and keeps showing the same results after 
refreshing! The regular website by the way wont show you not relevant serch 
results..."
2018,1,"SCAM SCAM SCAM Website and app is a scam. You check prices and shows 
tickets for ¬£21 - ¬£34 when you click on them price goes up all over the 
sudden to ¬£¬£92 -¬£100. And each time you click on flights showing interest 
on certain flights including near dates price is going up more and more 
within each click."
2018,5,"Your widget showing lowest priced fares is great but can be further 
significantly improved by adding travel-time-frame (number of days, cause 
date-frames are redundant) filter orientation.. Cause it's common for all 
to have a set time for travel and would orient towards this time-frame.. 
This filter can also be added in the main application as well.."
2018,5,"This app has made planning a vacation so much easier on me. It provides the 
latest airline and hotel rates and updates you if they change. Its easy to 
use and has amazing pictures of your destination. Overall very happy with 
this app and will be recommending it to all of my friends."
2018,3,"After update , the price alert no longer working. Even for desktop also 
same. Become non friendly user. Last time is better"
2018,4,"I like Skyscanner. One disadvantage: when you select ""2 passengers"", some 
prices come for 2 tickets, some - for 1. It creates a big confusion. Please 
make it more clear: this is price for ONE ticket, this - for TWO. Also, 
please make the prices font bigger."
2018,5,"It used to not go to the actual flight sights. This was a problem since I 
couldn't purchase tickets from the app since international flights would 
block my card. Since I go to the actual sites now it's easier. Good job"
2018,5,"In my opinion the best app to find flights. The option to see the cheapest 
flight days is also super useful. Most airlined are shown on this app. 
Booked flights all over the world using this app. Tumbs up!"
2018,5,"I love Skyscanner. I've been using it for 5+ years because of it's great 
features. I've compared it with other flight search engines and Skyscanner 
consistently find the best price."
2018,5,"Need more imporvment when I have change data then I need to go very back 
from start .i want If I don't like date I should change date from same 
page.thanks .any way I am very happy and always use when ever I wana travel 
."
2018,1,"It's look good when date selection step provide colour dot indicator for 
lower prices. But it's a fake. Cheating"
2018,5,"Very quick service,and much cheaper comparing to others .. I'm using it 
since long time for fly tickets ,hotels and car rental"
2018,4,"My mom had to get to the motherland üáπüá¥ for her uncles funeral and it was 
a last minute reservation, but I got on this app and bought a cheap 
roundtrip ticket to get her there on time for the funeral. Definitely using 
this app again."
2018,5,"This app has made it incredibly easy to find the best deal on a flight that 
you want. I will use this over going to the airline from now on."
2018,5,"Love this app, always use it to look for a flight prices. I like the fact 
that it uses statistical analysis to figure out best prices"
2018,3,"A very useful app..only negative point is it doesn't have multi - city 
option on the app like on the website... developers should look into this"
2018,1,"Rubbish, links risky websites, far from cheap prices, changed, used to be 
good. So bad now!"
2018,5,"Very nice app, gives accurate flight search results. Doesn't change at time 
of booking"
2018,5,"New to this app but I can say it is very easy to use! I like how you can 
save a flight and come back to it later!"
2018,4,"Very good app for quick, easy and relevant searches for flights. Found it 
very good for the price comparisons as well."
2018,5,"Good app to calculate your approximate travel costs. Haven't used it to 
book anything yet."
2018,5,Great app I use this service already for many years... never fails me <3
2018,5,"Its good but sometimes the companies which it suggests are a bit sketchy 
sounding. But one of the best flight engines"
2018,2,"Used to use this a lot. But now after the update, it keeps forced close and 
is useless now."
2018,5,"I fly pretty much every week and this is my go to app to find the best 
price on flights I swear by it."
2018,5,Always my go to travel booking app. Dependable. üòÄüòÄ
2018,4,"Its really useful in getting flights booked at reasonable price and 
importantly its really convenient and flexible to use."
2018,4,"I couldn't find research fly for 1 month it is shows me only dates of month 
but i can't fix all month anyone help me pls(:"

2018,5,It gives me a great idea which day to travel on to get a good deal
2018,5,"User friendly, with maximum info available easily"
2018,4,"Good app....it helps in showing very affordable prices of airlines and can 
book tickets with ease"
2018,4,"I prefer to see all the prices when i select the whole month like in the 
website"
2018,4,"The alerts should pop-up when prices go down, not whenever they change"
2018,5,"It has very great options.i hope they add a payment method with bitcoin 
too. It will be great idea for the company"
2018,1,Did not work for 4 passangers. Bad üëé
2018,5,"I like that it keeps you updated on the prices of the flights you're

2018,4,"The alerts are not frequent enough. As quickly as prices can change- 
receiving price updates once every 24 hours is not helpful. If I have to 
manually monitor the app for updates- what's the point of setting an alert. 
And today, its insists that my selected flight is 844 even though the 
carrier and other sites list it at 611. I'm not a fan so far."
2018,1,"You should be alert of the suppliers who posted on your app! I tried to 
rent a car from this arguscarhired. Com, but after I confirmed my payment 
with bank they said I never paid! It's a scam and fraud website! Then I 
tried to contact this skyscanner there is phone number at all! Please don't 
use this app to book a car!"
2018,2,"Price indicated may not be the final price, at lest for Scoot, so book 
carefully. Could be a budget thing... Can this be fixed please? 142 bucks 
tax not even included in the price quoted here."
2018,1,"I bought a $250 ticket and can't find any information on it. What the app 
needs is a way or an easy way to check on the status of your tickets or at 
least any information on them. The fact that it does not have an easy 
option for this strange and could easily turn people away from the app."
2018,5,"Skyscanner is my number one travel companion when it comes to booking 
flights! As a travel addict, i can always rely on skyscanner to give me the 
best option that suits my budget and travel needs. However, I wish the app 
could be updated with a multi-city option for Android!!"
2018,2,"What i love is it tells me the total of all the flights combined instead of 
me seeing it after ive decided to purchase. Im pretty excited and i like 
this app a lot. Very user friendly!"
2018,2,"This app does not find all the flights that their website does. Typically 
an app should enhance user experience on a smartphone/tablet.. this app is 
many steps below skyscanner website(which i love and use regularly)"
2018,3,"I've used this app often and have found it very useful, but lately, when I 
tap on the icon for the app, it says 'app doesn't exist'. Also, I'd get 
updates, but then have to relogin every time. This has become extremely 
annoying."
2018,3,"The frequent data search history that adapts the prices is pure capitalism 
at it's worst. Handy app but always use another device to actually book."
2018,5,"Love that you can save flights to look back later. Also lets you know which 
dates are the cheapest to fly, which helps of your plans are flexible. Love 
ot"
2018,3,"I use skyscanner for most of my flights planning either using app or web, 
it's pretty cool. However would like to see the multi-city search to be 
available on the app and also notification alerts for those on the app and 
web."
2018,3,"The best part of this app - An option to select the whole country of 
departure and landing , instead of typing(trying) all airports in the 
country like id*ot - is gone ? Why ? Why's that ? To introduce Top Deals , 
but without option to fly only one way üòÇ ? Botched update....Sorry to see 
that üò¢"
2018,2,"Prices shown are 20% lower than when redirected to the actual ticket 
website. This is misleading. Better use Expedia for quality search results."
2018,5,"First time of using and found a great deal to a place I never thought I'd 
go. So I'd say, if your just looking for adventure, it's pretty darn good."
2018,5,"I love to travel and am always looking for a new place to visit. This is is 
the only site that offers prices to anywhere in the world from your 
departing airport. I love that!!"
2018,5,"Great app. Use all the time. Although did have to uninstall and reinstall 
app on phone when old one became very slow."
2018,5,"So far so good, I managed to book my flight reservations without any hassle 
and they show the best prices than most online travel companies"
2018,5,"Love the fly to anywhere feature. Not sure if there is a multi City option 
but that would be good to have."
2018,5,"Really cool features that other apps do not offers. Such as the option to 
serch for the cheapest tickets from the nearest airport."
2018,3,"Ok, but it despite a number of airlines now starting to release flights 
BEYOND 11 months in advance the app is still only limited to searches up to 
11 months in advance."
2018,1,"Ok, so you nagged and nagged for feedback, and ruined the app experience. 
So, here's the one-star feedback for making it painful to use your app."
2018,5,"It is a very useful tool for searching flights. Easy to navigate and the 
everywhere search function is a lot of fun."
2018,5,"All in one. Useful, easy to use app for finding all possible flights at 
once."
2018,4,"I like the summaries and description of the flight. Very useful in setting 
expectations"
2018,5,"Best flight app, real prices , airlines can't lie to you anymore :)"
2018,5,Quick way to find all my trips and restaurants. Thank you.
2018,5,"Its has helped me so many times. No need for to many browser tabs. On click 
and you're done. Nice app"
2018,5,"Great app and great service. I only use Skyscanner to find flights, now."
2018,2,Crashed on first flight scan. :( xperia z5
2018,5,Very good apps. It provides cheapest air fare. Good job and well done.
2018,1,Only delta or united flights show. No good for DFW hub
2018,5,"One of the flight booking Apps. U can choose a city and see where is the 
cheapest place to travel to."
2018,5,Full marks for flight price comparison. But for hotel comparison not good.
2018,5,I am a frequent user of this apps. I can only say it is one of the best
2018,4,"Good app gives all the options . Only thing that would be better if you 
could have a calendar view of flights"
2018,1,Like the other apps I do not want to sign up. All I want is a price
2018,5,I can see any flights from here.. With many options
2018,5,A really great App. The price alerts option is a great feature.
2018,5,Great Travel Apps.. especially the price alert
2018,5,Great app to check flight tickets prices.
2018,4,"It's good to check cheap international destinations but it should have

2018,4,Let's see
2018,5,Expensive
2018,5,Allows me to explore options

2018,5,Super
2018,5,Awesomw
2018,5,Usful
2018,5,Offers wow
2018,5,easay to used
2018,3,"Fix this. It is annoying as Hell to have to move the icon back to the 
mainscreen folder after an update. If the app is already downloaded-which 
updating indicates- then it should not have to be put back where it was on 
a phone before the update. A simple annoyance that should not even be 
happening."
2018,1,"Poor app that shows different prices to the website or says there is no 
flights available when I've looked on the website and there are plenty. 
Can't look on the website on my phone due to the app. Uninstalling. 0/10"
2018,3,"Ok! I just installed your app. Hope its better.. I searched through the net 
more that 20 flights and none had the price you showed on monthly 
calendar..Always more...sometime a lot more."
2018,5,"If you are a big down-to-every-detail planner like me, then this app is for 
you as well. Makes your travel planning with ease, easily seeing all the 
best airline options and price matching."
2018,4,"Like the explore function that I could find the best ticket when I don't 
know where to go. Never tried to buy a ticket via Skyscanner so rate 4 
stars only. The app is easy to use though."
2018,5,"I use this app a lot to check flight prices, it's very useful for checking 
the best deal, although I have never buy the tickets through them. Also, I 
think it's easier to use the website than the app"
2018,5,"Previously, I have some issue with the app.they explain about the 
development of the multi city to Android. So im happy. Good thing about 
this company is they reply to both my email and reviews which show that 
they value their consumer and thats best aspect of this.."
2018,5,"Sometimes flights don't always work out but they deliver on the cheapest 
prices I've found yet. They route things in ways other places don't think 
to."
2018,3,"Don't understand how to set up whole month View of prices for the cheapest 
day instead of a particular day. Using a tablet and app."
2018,3,"Why doesnt it allow me to do multi flights im sure it did before the last 
update, wish I hadnt updated it now only letting me look at one way or 
return flights"
2018,5,"Great app to compare various flight fares.. Serves the purpose completely! 
Absolutely recommended:)"
2018,1,"Does not work so good on my android phone...very frustrateing to use. 
Preferred the older version."
2018,5,"Always a great comparison tool. Never fails on me or drops out like many 
apps. Thanks"
2018,1,"This app is garbage. Can't do multi city searches. Can't do nearby 
airports. Can't do nearby dates. A competent app will have flexibility of 
parameters and fuzzy logic searches."
2018,5,"I can't seem to get the multicity tab option in my app. It comes on my 
other phone. What's wrong?"
2018,1,"Why do I have to get both emails AND push notifications for price changes? 
I eant the option to pick one or the other."
2018,5,"Great app that provides options other apps and websites don't. It's the 
best place to find a flight from anywhere to anywhere."
2018,4,First time user. Good experience. Price alerts very helpful.
2018,4,"I love the app, it's easy to use and great pricing. I only wish toy could 
do multi-city on the app and not just on the website."
2018,5,"A great way to find the right flight and hotel package with a brilliant 
filter system to prevent too much information and make choosing a holiday 
easy"
2018,5,"Helped me get better price, compared to the original website. Great work 
guys!"
2018,5,"great app, yet the user has to be ready with all info and desired dates, 
otherwise you cannot get what you want"
2018,5,I am loving it. It has saved me a lot of money on tickets. Thank you
2018,5,"Great tool for keeping track of flight prices to specific locations and 
also for working out where you can go for a certain budget."
2018,5,"Fast, easy to use, the best go to app for checking prices on flight and on 
the go and choose the best reservation on your terms."
2018,5,"I've tried other apps and compared results with Skyscanner - and every 
single time this app finds the cheapest flight. Every time."
2018,4,"Good app for foreign traveller. Please add also a drop box to choose 
currency. It only shows in $."
2018,1,I travel to another country and it changes the language so i can't use it. Well done
2018,3,Recent version doesn't support multi city trips. Bring it back
2018,2,Why doesn't it do multi city flights like kayak? You can in the website.
2018,5,"Great App.Easy to use,no hidden charges and I have always been 100% 
satisfied whenever I have used it.I think it's the best flight finder App 
out there."
2018,3,"Unable to check price for multi country tickets though the app. Need to use 
the web for that"
2018,4,This app is very helpful with price comps. Love using it.
2018,5,Accurate pricing and the app has a plethora of flights to find. Nice!
2018,5,Very good app... Gives correct information regarding the flights...
2018,4,"It makes search flight so very easier and even gives us the best fare which 
is not found in other sites..very convenient too"
2018,5,"Very useful app, especially the feature to set an alert to all the prices :)"
2018,5,Thanks skyscanner its very good app. & easy to acsses I like it
2018,5,Brilliant website! It's all I use to check flights!
2018,2,"Made a booking from via PYO, one of skyscanner's booking agents and regret 
it ultimately! It's so BAD"
2018,4,"I would've given it 5 if I could search for tickets in multiple cities, so 
I usually have to use the website version instead."
2018,5,The best application for flights with lowest price. Well done.
2018,5,"Finds me great deals for both international and domestic travel from the 
U.S."
2018,5,It shows all the flights available and usually has the best price.
2018,4,Very useful and easy to use even for 1st timers.. keep up the good work!
2018,4,App is great. I wish it would have functionality to filter bagage included!
2018,4,"Would be great if the rental car could also be filtered by car 
specifications like fuel type. :)"
2018,5,Great for travel hackers looking for cheap flights.
2018,5,Use it for every trip I plan. Easy and efficient
2018,4,"Working perfect, but search s limited."
2018,4,"No shows online booking site, where we can online contact ... Only shows 
fare price"
2018,4,Good app for flight deal
2018,5,"Easy to use, very helpful love it very munch! üòç"
2018,5,"Great app, i used it almost every week to search and book flights."

2018,5,This app saves me money and make my life easy when going abroad.
2018,5,"Excellent app I love it, can view full details , about what we search"
2018,5,By far the best way to find the most inexpensive airfare...
2018,5,"The option called explore is great as it can give you ideas where to go 
from my local airport."
2018,5,Just starting with this app but very pleased so far.
2018,4,Great apps when looking for a good deals.
2018,5,"solid, easy to use, cross checked online, it delivers"

2018,1,"Used the desktop version and it is fantastic. This mobile app however won't 
allow you to search multiple cities. I have installed it on my Samsung s8 , 
and my Samsung tab A. both wont allow multi function. Very frustrating 
trying to plan a holiday."
2018,1,"I bought a ticket from Tripsta.co.nz When I try to contact them, it just 
terrible experience. Took three days for them to reply e-mail. Never buy a 
ticket from tripsta again. No customer service at all."
2018,3,"I have it on my iPhone too. It differs from the IOS version in that it 
won't enable you to book for multicity flights, which is a huge bummer for 
me. I always love to travel to multiple cities during my vacation."
2018,5,"Have only used it for flight searches. But so far so good. Brought up 
options not shown on other platforms."
2018,5,"I wish I worked for Skyscanner. Travel has never been easier and though I 
prefer the web site, the app is handy."
2018,5,"Very good app to find cheap flights around the world. Have definitely find 
some good gems on it. Thanks"
2018,4,"Would rate 5 stars if the feature to search for cheapest flight over the 
month was available in the app instead of only on the website"
2018,1,"I had done a Google search and found lots of flights for my trip. This app 
came up with zero."
2018,5,"The everywhere choice is great and I have found incredible bargains. I have 
seen so many wonderful places thanks to this app"

2018,5,"All the leg work done. We just need to pick the best package that fits our

2018,5,"So I have actually been using this app since about 2015 or so and I have 
never been disappointed the ability to pay in multiple currency is amazing 
when I am in another country and need to book a ticket with my currency. 
The prices are great for both hotel and flights and the ability to have it 
across my phone and pc is helpful"
2018,5,"This is a great app I had been using this for few years now and is the most 
efficient, reliable and quickest way to find cheap and best possible 
tickets. Skyscanner THANK YOU so much for making ticket booking so easy."
2018,3,"I could neither change dates for a trip I had saved nor delete it. The app 
does offer a lot of control over other things though."
2018,5,"Great app because it showed a better rate for the flight I was looking for. 
Hope was lost before my friend told me to install the app and find a better 
quote."
2018,5,"Awesome App. Shows greater number of options than some competitors. It's 
become my go-to app for flights."
2018,5,Simple. Efficient. Great interface. Does the work for you.
2018,5,Awesome app. Directs me to the required provider for flight tix.
2018,4,"Great app. I think the developers behind this app have done a great job 
especially with connecting external clients (other airlines) to the app"
2018,5,Will be using this app from now on. Thanks....üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ
2018,5,My favourite application on the Google Play Store.
2018,2,Doesn't show flights by month anymore.
2018,4,Good app!

2018,5,EXCELLENT APPS.

2018,4,"Looks like a good app and I like that it optionally saves your filters; I 
just wish you could filter out the airline and it show correctly on the 
preview page for ""Explore."" I don't feel safe flying Allegiant and they 
have the lowest prices (for a reason), so when I click, the prices within 
are higher. Please fix this and you'll definitely get 5 stars!"
2018,5,"Tinder is very good at doing what it does, and doing it in a clean, simple 
interface... I think the primary appeal of Tinder as a dating platform is 
its minimalist bias, encouraging people to interact and meet rather than 
endlessly tweak their profiles and read those of others. Select a few good 
pics, write some words, and meet people.."
2018,1,"Quite unpleasant to use, go to Skyscanner website if you want to use 
filters (as everyone does). Hard to select start time and journey time as 
filters, forced to select start time and arrival time as journey time 
doesn't work. There is then no ""apply filters"" button so nothing happens. 
Uninstalled, pretty poor"
2018,1,"It sucks it cost me 750$ for nothing. i bought ticket from southkorea to 
kabul 1500$ and just after one hour i cancelled the app makeer said to me 
we are so sorry we only can send you half of the price 750$ I just lost my 
750$ for nothing Soo please guys do not use this app"
2018,4,"The app is very user friendly and it provides wide range of selections for 
flights, the only improvement I could think of is the lack of flexibility 
on the dates (I could find the option if my travel dates are flexible), 
other than that, it's as good as it gets!üòâ"
2018,5,"Saves me alot of $ when planning my trips. I recently returned from a 2 
week 3 city tour for less than $200 thanks largely to skyscanner. GREAT app 
üòÅ"
2018,5,"I love it. I always use this app when i need to travel. The best feature is 
the month view. However, the web experience is better than the app because 
it shows the estimated prices on the month view, where in the mobile app it 
only shows color codes. I can plan travels on web more than mobile app."
2018,5,"I tried several apps and this is far the best. Best prices, you can save 
your searches and specific flights that you want to follow before buying, 
it's fast and great."
2018,5,"Great app always use this for all travels personal as well as official. 
Wish they have some loyalty points too..."
2018,4,"I love this app. I just wish it automatically gave you suggestions for 
cheaper flights around your selected dates or cheaper airports not too far 
from your selected departure location."
2018,5,"Great APP but could be Amazing if it displayed the same information as the 
web version. For example the month view should display the price rather 
than a colour code."
2018,5,"Good app. It helps me to find a cheap ticket, also I can compair the price 
with many different airlines ."
2018,4,"I like the fact that it shows you dates where you can fly at a cheaper 
price yet I don't like the fact that it directs you to book your ticket 
with unknown travel sites"
2018,5,"I love the simplicity and the design of the app. Overall, an ease to manage 
flights without second guessing..."
2018,5,"I think this app is more better than other's that I went to check for 
flight schedules that am planning.. thanks"
2018,1,"You direct me to a site ( last minute) which did not confirm my booking 
after they took the money and no refund till now Even they did not mention 
any reason for that Please take an action against them"
2018,5,"Great app! Easy to find and understand, very fast and a very good option to 
get your flights"
2018,5,"La sto usando estensivamente da due giorni per prenotare alcuni viaggi e 
far combinare itinerari impossibili. La trovo versatile, efficiente e 
semplice da usare, senza sbavature, fornisce le informazioni in modo 
immediato e comprensivo."
2018,5,"Nothing bad to day about the app. Everything works the way it's supposed 
to, I'm very satisfied with everything."
2018,5,"Good app, I usually use it to get the bests air ticket prices. I really 
recommend."
2018,4,"Used it multiple times over the years. I'd wish the prices would be the 
same on the site and the app"
2018,5,One stop shop to review several flight options. And very easy to use
2018,1,"Never found a single flight, ever. Something is broken."
2018,5,"Clean interface and straight to the point. This is The best app of its 
genre."
2018,4,Great app. I miss the chart with prices and dates.
2018,5,Easy to use and compare flights. What's not to likr
2018,1,"Not what it was, too many pics rather than all important numbers!"
2018,4,Quick and easy to use. Matched up with hopper app..
2018,5,"Plz make sure to change little things wat I mention it. Everything is very 
well in this app .plz ensure about person privacy also."
2018,2,"Unable to search multi stop flights in app and therefore useless to my 
needs."
2018,4,"Very handy app, has the same features as the website."
2018,4,"There is no multi-city option in there. In iPhone there was. Where I can 
find this option?"
2018,4,"It works well, easy to use and fast respond."
2018,1,Why do I need a melodramatic sign in procedure just to get ticket prices?
2018,5,Simple. Straightforward. How travel booking should be.
2018,4,Great having a guide to all countries on one page to compare
2018,5,"Cheapest rates only available in this app.tricks lies in searching , 
wonderful search technique.love this app.very useful ."
2018,4,The only problem is it does not have multi city option
2018,5,Now is working very well. Thank you
2018,5,"It does everything you need it to do apart from physically flying for you 
it's great"
2018,5,"As someone who very frequently takes long and short haul in different parts 
of the world this is one of my go to apps"
2018,5,"Super easy to use, excellent app."
2018,4,Just installed. Seems to work as advertised
2018,5,"Practical, clean and joyful! ‚úåüëå‚õ∞"
2018,5,You can always depend on it in helping you organizing travel plans.
2018,5,Good to find best options with price change notifications.
2018,5,Very Handy At the time of searching value for money deals
2018,5,Would be very handy to search flights by month again
2018,5,Quick and easy to use. also has the lowest fares
2018,4,It can provide what the local app cannot.

2018,5,Does what it says
2018,5,Short direct
2018,3,"One of the fastest and useful apps for getting air travel options at a 
glance. Well thought out interface. Works well for rental cars too. Update 
: The fares are meaningless because the lowest prices shown are from shady 
companies and not the airline itself. Please remove these companies who are 
quoting unrealistic prices and masking the true cost"
2018,4,"It's an easy to use app that does just what it says and scans for best 
prices. The push notifications with price changes isn't as effective as I'd 
hope. Would appreciate an option to add sound along with multicity. Also 
would appreciation if alerts could be set up for accommodations."
2018,3,"Lacking multi-flight feature. Automatically renders it not useful to a 
large segment of travelers, like myself. Would reconsider, if/when this 
otherwise ubiquitous search feature is added."
2018,1,"Fraudulently deducting money from the account without consent, knowledge 
and permission. Please don't book your tickets from this application, i 
booked a ticket from this & paid from debit card, it didn't ask for OTP for 
debition of ticket amount and now after 5 days they again deducted money 
for unknown reasons"
2018,5,"It worked really well for me. Before i downloaded it, I tried to find 
flights by surfing. It was a giant waste of time. Within 8 minutes I had 
all the information that I needed. Thanks guys"
2018,5,"Excellent app. I find it the best app to buy your aorplanes ticket 
depending on price, time of departure. It allows you to search within a 
month's time and suggests which days is best price. I prefer using the full 
page as it gives you a few more options"
2018,4,"Very useful, the best app to get the best prices. The android version does 
not allow multi-cities research, please fix it up."
2018,4,"I love this app! I recommend it to everyone. The only thing is not being 
able to plug in multiple destinations, but still the best I've come across!"
2018,5,"I have used this app for years and always book my flights with it, but I 
want to know when and why we have not yet got the multi-city booking tool 
on the app version?? Also, a see-where-my-money-can-take-me feature would 
be good..."
2018,5,"It is a great way to find cheap flights and the way they give us so kuch 
information about the airline and the journey . It tells us ideal timmings 
and prices for a family . It great I love it !!!‚ù§üòä"
2018,1,"It doesn't have multi destination search capability! Travelling is a bit 
more than a return trip..."
2018,5,"On the skyscanner websight there is a multi city option but on the app 
there is not. I find myself having to go to the website often when booking

2018,2,"The new update is awful and frustrating. I miss being able to enter the search settings so only the relevant info will show. Now it's just confusing. Also, seeing the prices for the hole month was very helpful to help selecting the cheapest day to travel. I can't find that now!! I see no improvements, all the good stuff is gone and new stuff is just confusing. I have given a 2 star only because the idea of this app is very useful for me as far as flights are concerned. I don't understand why this app felt the need to add car hire and hotels. There are a lot of apps for that in the market and this app should focus more on what it is good at.  Thank you for your reply. I had already found the chart days but is not as easy as you describe. You have to select the days at the beginning of the search. Then search. Then select the days again and only then the chart icon will appear. It's confusing. Also you need to select the ""direct flights only"" option on every single search which is ver annoying. Lastly i feel that the generalised ""search by country"" (to check the cheapest airports in the contry) is not working properly and i had to check each departing airport to each destination airport which is very time consuming if those countries have 4 ou 5 airports each. This becomes an even bigger problem if you want to return by a diferente airport that might be cheaper.  Multy airport search is still a nightmare! Alerts have stop working properly. It now shows all flights including flights with stops and change in prices are shown for the cheapest flight even though they do not interest me. I would like to be able to add an alert for a specific flight at the time of my choosing otherwise this function is useless. Also if the app can remember your preferred settings for all searchers would be a massive improvement rather then changing it every time. Also i cant select the dates i want in multy search mode, it only shows me the cheapest dates for the next 3 months but if i want to fly in august i cant select any flights, so this is also useless. These 3 items used to work well in the past but it seems worst with recent updates."
2018,1,"This app would be amazing if the prices advertised were real prices. Half 
the time I find an ""amazing deal"" on some flight and am redirected to 
another website to purchase it, only find out the ticket is actually 
$800-1000 more than what was listed on Skyscanner. I get a little bit of 
price variance, but that's a massive difference. I've used the website to 
find trips before but the quality has gone down a lot, I doubt I'll keep 
using it with all these fake deals around."
2018,5,"I am a fan of Skyscanner and have been raving about them for YEARS! They 
are truly innovating the way we search and purchase travel. I love the 
flight to ""everywhere"" option and the fact that you can search an entire 
month to figure out the cheapest times to fly. I use it to figure out the 
cheapest way to get to Europe and then search for cheap flights on smaller 
carriers to get to my final destination. I have not seen any other company 
offering anything like it!"
2018,2,"In my experience, app doesn't allow purchases. Prices rarely match. Allows vague trip comparisons, just like every other travel website out there."
2018,4,"I REALLY LIKE THIS APP HOWEVER I USUALLY PREFER TO TRAVEL TO 2-3 COUNTRIES 
WHEN I AM ON LONG HOLIDAYS AND THIS APP DOESN'T ALLOW ME TO CHECK PRICES 
FOR MULTI-TRIPS, FOR THIS I HAVE TO GO ON TO MY COMPUTER. BUT STILL A GREAT 
APP FOR QUICKLY CHECKING PRICES."
2018,3,"This app was my favorite for years until recently it took a step backwards. 
What happened to searching over a certain time period or month? That was 
one feature which made this app stand out."
2018,2,"It's a really good app, unfortunately it never shows the real prices at 
first.... you choose the cheapest day, once you confirm the price doubles 
and then once I chose a deal the price goes foe another ¬£10!! Wth...."
2018,1,"Worse app ever. Super slow, the price never match, in fact price more 
expencive then shown in this app. Wery frustrating to choose ticket through 
this app. Never use it!!!"
2018,5,I've checked through more than 20 different flight/hotel apps. This seems the easiest and tonight after searching with 5 other apps this gave the cheapest option by a long way..thank you!
2018,4,"Great app but doesn't have the multi city function that the website offers. 
Apart from that it's worthy of being the primary resource for searching and 
comparing flights."
2018,1,"The old app was so much better and user friendly! What happen to multi 
stops anyway. That's the main reason most people use the app for anyway"
2018,5,"Very good! But it could be easier if I could filter all the flights that 
are not direct, because now I can filter only 1 kind of flights (for 
example: it can hide only direct flights/only 1 stop flights/only 2 stops+ 
flights)"
2018,5,"Shows cheaper dates to fly with very large selection of flights to choose from. Always come here first as it's quick, informative and accurate."
2018,1,"This app lost one of the main features of the skyscanner website. Is no 
longer possible to look for the cheapest price :("
2018,1,"Nagging notifications that are not relevant to the searches I have 
subscribed to. It essentially pops up to say ""please open the app today."" 
Totally useless"
2018,5,Best app to check for great flight deals! Very easy to use. Love it!
2018,1,"used to be good,last year(2017) worked fine.in the last 3 month became so 
unreliable,not sure if gonna use it again unless fixed."
2018,4,"Fast response. It would be amazing to put alarms for flights taking also 
the hour filter into consideration."
2018,4,"Add some more filters. If the chosen date is not available, suggest another one. Apart from that, the app is perfect."
2018,5,"Only use it for single destination trips and have found it really useful 
when deciding where to go next based on prices."
2018,5,"An excellent application. I used it to find / compare flights to various 
destinations and it does what it should do."
2018,2,The multi city booking feature is unavailable.. used to be better last year

2018,4,"Great for flights, hotels. Very useful."
2018,2,"It's not as comprehensive as before. Now, just a few airlines can be seen."
2018,4,"Would get 5 stars if it had multi city choice, it does on iOS but not 
android ü§î"
2018,3,App cannot create multicity booking. Plse add this feature.

2018,1,No icon on my desktop (Galaxy Note 8). The only way to run the program is via the Play Store. Weird.
2018,3,3 stars only because the app does not allow me to filter search results by alliances (web version has this feature).

2018,5,Great app and the one I go to first! Well done.
2018,1,I booked a ticket and the site you gave me deducted the price in my debit card then suddenly cancelled without any explanation. Is ita scam! And how can a trusted app allow this sites into them. And how can i contact your customer service now
2018,5,Very informative. Has all the traveling info I need. Not only it keeps you up to date on flights it posts flights before they're available on the actual airline website. I was able to book my flight for half the price the other airlines were showing for one of the busiest times of year. So grateful
2018,5,"Guys, this is by far the most useful app to get cheap flights out there. I have tried lots of apps and this is me one that always shows me the best fares. First, It helped me to choose best range of date to look for flights. Second, it helped me to watch these dates using alerts. Third, when I identified what was the flight I wanted to buy, it helped me to watch the flight fare so I watched it like 4 days and I knew what was the real optimal fare."
2018,1,"MAJ √† revoir. Auparavant, l'appli √©tait parfaite pour trouver des billets d'avion. Maintenant il est impossible de faire une recherche : oblig√© de mettre une date fixe (plus possible le mois entier) et les prix affich√©s ne correspondent pas du tout √† la date choisie, quand tu veux voir plus de d√©tails pour un prix, fermeture de l'application. MAJ √† revoir. Je suis √† 2 doigts de d√©sinstaller l'appli"
2018,5,What happened? This app used to be the best of all ticket apps because the flexible easy to use data graph with date and price. Now its a complete mess.  Can only select 1 date or 1 month!?  And doesnt even  work.  Can I still download your old app?
2018,5,"My go-to app for every single flight need. I've booked several flight tickets and in turn, saved good money. All thanks to the Skyscanner dedicated team. Keep up the brilliant work, folks!"
2018,5,"It's fantastic! The best prices mostly. However the routes are jambled up at times. Love the everywhere option. Could expand it's search results as per customers previous search, customise a bit more."
2018,5,"I didn't get the idea behind this ""new"" version of the app and old version which seems identical to the new; but a fresh start is always a good thing. Rest is just same; everybody's using this app before buying a plane ticket."
2018,4,I prefer to use this app always get the flights at the price point I require as I tend to be a late booker ..but be aware of the questions some suppliers ask as they sometimes add costs when you have specifically have not requested them.
2018,5,"When I travel to Europe without a planned itinerary, the ""everywhere"" destination feature is fantastic!  Just enter the date and place you're leaving from and this app provides a list of possible destinations and fares!  Brilliant feature üòÑ"
2018,4,"Good App. Booked a flight today. User Friendly, Premium agents under one roof. Good rates too. Have been using this for sometime now."
2018,5,Since I found this app I didn't use another one. This app finds the cheapest flights and is easy to book them. Thank you Skyscanner for helping people travel easier!
2018,5,"Great app, easy to use and clean interface. Getting alerts for fare changes on fights I've searched for is a huge weight off my mind because i can sit back and wait with confidence that skyscanner will let me know when a good fare comes along."
2018,5,"This app I think is the best for helping you find flights, especially those you plan last minute. The family reviews are helpful too to show you which airlines are the best to travel withüëåüèæüëåüèæ I recommend this to all who love travellingüòÑ"
2018,5,"Smooth, convenient, well built app. Often able to retrieve the best prices versus competitors. Rarley bother looking anywhere else."
2018,4,"Great app!  One improvement I'd like to see.  I wish they would add the ability to filter by airline alliance (e.g. Star, One World)"
2018,5,What happened?  This was the best app. I used to be able to see timeline with cheapest flights available on every day. Is this the same app? Whats going on?
2018,4,"It would be nice to add the ability to search for flights without any dates entered. Otherwise, great app."
2018,4,"Most of the cheap prises r given by Tripsta which is a scam, absolutely unreliable. I request Skyscanner team to check this or remove it so that people could avoid the problems."
2018,5,Amazin app. Found a plane ticket in no time. Cheapest price available
2018,1,"If this app will transfer me to main website of airline with excatly same high fair !!!It shows fake ticket prices, So its not worth to download it, go direct to main airline website"
2018,4,Best app to look for flights.  This has the best search features and the app/website are continuing to improve.
2018,1,"The app doesn't work at all. It says, Network unavailable, please check your settings while we check our servers."
2018,5,"Excellent app, higly recommended, easy to use.  best price..Amin"
2018,5,"Everytime when I'm flying somewhere I use this app. Well done, thank you."
2018,5,Love SkyScanner and the app is really useful! Great for finding the best flights.
2018,1,I want to find cheapest ticket in one search: departing from any of 10 airports in 4 countries close yo me! Not possible!!!
2018,5,Very good app to check ticket prices & book tickets. Thanks to the developer.
2018,1,this is good example - starting from top now at the bottom. useless app. getting more cr@py...!!!!!

2018,5,"Great help to plan my trip, thank you"
2018,4,"Your App is amazing But Please Include Multi City Feature in the App as you 
have in your Website...... Please Add This Feature"
2018,1,"Not working well, says no internet connection all the time!"

2018,3,Flights search is good. Hotel search always crash...
2018,5,Much better but i'm missing the fly to anywhere option...
2018,5,really i love this app.
2018,5,I really love this app
2018,5,Simply perfect
2018,5,Cool
2018,5,Best prices than any other app.
2018,1,"Unfortunately, this app has  become hardly useful anymore, it is very unintuitive, lacking simple things, such as to see nearby days flight prices. Searching by country is a total mess!!! Not sure was it some policies that restrict from properly showing prices and days, or just that app designer ""too smart"". Now it is much better to use website."
2018,2,"One of the best Apps just bombed. If I look for a flight on certain dates, the search only gives results for random dates. Also on app, widget and browser pls put an option of selecting multiple airports to depart from (or within x miles or have more groups like 'London (Any)').  EDI, GLA & PIK all work for me."
2018,4,"Easy to use üëçüèª Simple design and great features.  ‚úîÔ∏è Helps you keep track of price changes. ‚úîÔ∏è There is a widget that let's you keep track of prices of flights to multiple locations across the world from your favorite Airport. ‚úîÔ∏è Features different languages (I'm using üá∏üá™)  ‚úîÔ∏è Currency options üíµüí∑üí∂üí¥üí±(More so than the other apps and sites I've seen. I use SEK/üá∏üá™ which is not always an option with other apps)  ‚úîÔ∏èMeasurements options, like metrical etc for distance; as well as Celsius/Fahrenheit etc. This is one of the best ways to check out flights, hotels and rental cars.  ‚úàÔ∏èüõ´üõ¨üí∫üöóüè®"
2018,4,"Aowsem app, very easy to use, but unfortunately sometimes it gives price from outside then when I enter I find another price which is higher, also I hope that you extend the number of months in explore section more than 3 months because usually we prepare for our journey approximately 6 months in advance, any way thank you for the great app"
2018,3,"The app needs a additional filter on the search to find flight connections that arrive and leave from the same airport, not just the same city. eg Searches where the first flight lands at Gatwick and the connection departs from Heathrow, are useless. The website has this option."
2018,4,This is a excellent app.  Can I just suggest adding the multi city option like on your website?   This the only thing making me go to your website instead of using this app on my phone.
2018,5,Excellent App. Using Sky scanner since last 1 and half year and booked 11 flights at best prices. Highly recommended. Time saver..  Thanks for your great effort guys.
2018,1,"This will not display prices in pounds, only Rand even though the language is in English (UK). So there's absolutely no point in the app."
2018,2,On my tablet this App is way worse than just using the mobile web site. Cant search by month and many other annoying  issues. Uninstalled until they  hire a better programmer
2018,3,Older version is better. Why change what functions well. Stick to flights! If I want packages I will go to a travel specialist.
2018,4,"Great app to find very cheap flights at random destinations, just wished the price graph was able to filter results by length of trip (e.g. finding best prices for a 4day trip like Google flights)"
2018,5,Great ticket costs compare! Food delivery? Like 'Lieferheld'? What a strange question in Google Play Store!
2018,5,"Nice app.... I used it for flight booking, it has price alert bell also... Which is very useful"
2018,4,Much improved since I last reviewed it in 2013. Now it's the first place I go to to look for the cheapest flights.
2018,5,"Best prices for flights, even better than hipmunk thanks to the long list of airlines they check."
2018,1,Wow. No multi-citi feature on the Android version? WTH. Can't believe this :O
2018,4,"I love this app it shows the cheapest flights, I wish they make the airplane model visible, and it will be great if they allow the option of the whole month selection in flights booking in the mobile app as the website does."
2018,1,Can't find UIA 0300 am flight from Gatwick to Kiev.... Can on desktop version. Useless
2018,4,Liked the old interface slightly better. But is good enough for searching for things...
2018,5,Finds me the cheapest flights and is easy to use... Great alert system to keep track of prices
2018,5,"Very useful. Easy to use, easy to compare other prices, and have good tickets prices too."
2018,4,Quick and easy to use and try different combinations and routings. Also like the quick access to flight details
2018,2,"Only show but does not give exact info like ""make my trip"""
2018,5,Sometimes I don't know where I want to go. Skyscanner has the option for me to choose anywhere and look at many options. Love it.
2018,5,"Additional tip would be to allow us to check prices for multiple cities. Otherwise, everything else is magnifique!"
2018,1,Redirection to different portals but final price does not match. Not like early days.
2018,1,What the hell happened? When I search now it picks whatever date it feels like. I just want the date I search for!
2018,5,This app is amazing she give you the lowest price also she give you the best way to book a flight keep going skyscanner
2018,2,"Homeless, since it no longer allows access to a specific trip on the widget opening screen"
2018,4,Good app... finding cheap flights is awesome.
2018,3,I search for a specific destination on a specific date from UK airports but the app then shows me explore which only offers me trips in the next few weeks and months
2018,5,"This has the cheapest plane tickets ever. Cheaper than the deals in cheapflights, kayak, hopper, exoedia,cheapair."
2018,4,Great app yo find cheaper flight travel seats.
2018,5,Great app got some good deals on flights the last couple of years!
2018,5,Intuitive and easy to use. My go to app for all my flight bookings.
2018,5,Very useful to find cheaper fares. Nice UI.
2018,4,The multi city tan needs to be included here. Please bring it. It's on the website and iOS app
2018,4,Overall this is a good app. Try it on your own and you would know.
2018,5,It's very easy and useful to compare prices of flights.
2018,4,It's a nice app I Will introduce to my friends. guys thumb up
2018,5,"Awesome app, just need to include the everywhere option for the destination and make it more easier to select the whole month price graph."

2018,5,The airfare i checked is amazingly cheap.. But still not sure about the payment's security.
2018,5,Awesome love the app. Always use and we are frequent travellers
2018,3,It's ok. I use it often to compare prices and have booked through it on several occasions
2018,1,"Come on, the inputted dates do not work."

2018,4,Very Mice App! Showing the best rates in the market!

2018,3,"The functionality of the app is good, but the ticket I purchased through one of the travel agents (ENA Travel) I found on here was not useable due to the age requirements for unaccompanied minor with the airline who the ticket was booked through. When I initially contacted the travel agent to get my money back, they refused to give me a refund. After refuting the charges through my bank, I was finally issued a refund. All of which was a very long and time consuming process."
2018,1,"The new update of the website and app sucks! It was way better the way it workef before when ypu just wantwd to see the cheapest destinations they had, now you have to check country by country and not.only that but the city as well, its such a hassle. Thumbs down, yoi really messed up."
2018,1,"I have attempted to book the cheapest tickets I could from Da Nang, to Ho Chi Minh City, and every single time I am met with an error message asking me to try another flight, and every time the next one up is above my available budget. I have tried 5 of the cheapest flights with one of these two issues occuring.  Totally unimpressed with either the bad communication between Skyscanner and the travel agent, or the broken algorithm which as far as I can tell keeps failing when I try and book an apparently available flight."
2018,1,Uninstalled It Now Prices only showing in dollars when am in UK LoL Won't even log me in to do any search for flights. The website is great but App just says not confirmed your Email as I have not received any email so cant do anything tbh 5 Stars will be left after i log in
2018,4,"Not easy way to search for flights for whole month, search any departure or any arrival, not sure how to set up a notification. Let's say I would like to fly direct from Basel to any place in October. Search for cheap flight and send me notofication"
2018,5,"I tried to search for flights, but had problem choosing the dates to start with. App has become too confusing and doesn't provide any value whatsoever. Will be removing app. It's really a shame, I'm utterly disappointed!"
2018,3,"Good app but incomplete and therefore not helpful.  Can't search for multi-city flights, only roundtrip and one-way.  Even their website lets you do this.  Not sure why this was left out."
2018,3,It's a shame that the app is much different on my android than the fianc√©s iPhone. A lot of times when we travel we don't fly back from the same airport we flew into since we travel to different cities. The android app doesn't have the multi city option which is weird because the iPhone app does. Why???
2018,3,"Its good, but could be better.  I can not search multi-city flights. This is its main drawback. Also flight alert is hard to find."
2018,2,"after latest update, widget won't work anymore. you can't set the date after picking destination, only show week, weeks option etc. without widget it's not as good as it used to be...sadly"
2018,2,Have booked good flights with this app. However they continue to show Carlton leisure to book with. This company is full of scammers and is holding 400 pounds of mine.
2018,4,"That would be great if you have multiple trips booking option on the app, e.g. I wanna go to Bangkok and the to Colombo a week later and back to my home city. At the moment it's only one way and return option on the app"
2018,4,I really like how this app shows which days are best to book flights. However my only complaint would be that sometimes the lowest prices available are not low at all.
2019,5,"Working Great. We had to change the flight dates several times, and Sky Scanner really helped to discover all the good flights, with different airlines."
2018,1,I used to live for the app but now that you cannot get search alerts for whole months it is just a waste of space & I dl'd it again to see if it had been improved only to find it's worse. Bye Felicia
2018,1,New interface is horrible. In addition the app keeps showing flights that are not available for booking and displays annoying pop up everytime you navigate back from a purchase.
2018,3,I downloaded this app as I use the Skyscanner to book flights all the time. I uninstalled it because the app is much much worse in functionality than the website so I'll just keep using that
2018,5,I keep on checking for affordable flights on airline sites to no avail but skyscanner had amazingly afforfable prices! Best app I ever had...for flightsüòÅ
2018,5,This app is the perfect for booking airline tickets. Truly I love Skyscanner just I hope you add up some more additional facilities to airline booking and information. Thank you
2018,1,"The widgets doesn't work as intended anymore. It used to be able to save a specific destination for specific dates but now, searching for a destination leads to another page without option to save widget."
2018,5,Pretty good. Try to make the comparison of prices with dividing the monitor in two independent apps. That will rock! Good luck!
2018,4,I booked flight to visit my country via your website. So helpfull and easy. So far so good. Thanks
2018,2,"Please fix the widget, after the recent update the widget can no longer save the desired destination being inputted."
2018,5,I love that the flight days are sectioned out by price. That helps a whole lot when picking. Best flight search app.
2018,1,It used to be a good site to get a good deal but not anymore it's got ripoff algorithms and the customer charter is a joke.
2018,4,I use this app everything when I decide to fly. The old version was amazing. The new version has too many steps
2018,5,Just exactly what one needs before planning your tour. Gives a good overview of prices from various sources and allows to select the most important filters.
2018,5,I get great deals on here especially for Jamaica. Helps as I have a big family so can prove expensive otherwise.
2018,5,Great layout. Intuitive UI and just shear fun to use. Well Impressed.
2018,5,I mainly use it to search flights. It connects to a lot of travel company and I can get the best price for flight by only using this app
2018,5,It's easy to find cheap flights. Really helpful. For sure 5star
2018,5,Great app.  I've been using this for all my flight search for more than 5 years.
2018,5,"Great app for travel. Best of all, NO BUGS!! üëçüèæ"
2018,3,Have to use pc version.. Too difficult to enter multiple searchs and monthly in the app
2018,4,Much improved from my review five years ago. It's back on my phone as a resource
2018,5,Definitely a must-have app for cheap flight searching. I used them a lot when I was in university.
2018,5,Really helps finds reasonable prices for flights! Love itüòä
2018,3,"Vorige versie kon je zoveel beter in grafiek mee vergelijken :(, krijg nu bijna altijd  geen gegevens beschikbaar)"
2018,4,I really like the flight and Hotel booking features. Really smart app.
2018,5,"Fantabulous! However, more local low cost airlines websites can be included and the issue of few websites not booking tickets through meandering clicks back and forth once confirmed can also be resolved."
2018,4,It's a nice app for searching flights n comparing prices .
2018,5,"I have used this app to book more than 30 flights, great deals and flexibility"
2018,4,Comparing to other travel sites. Skyscanner pretty cheap.
2018,5,Multiple destination searches - such as NYC to Germany or Italy will yield all the options - can save hundreds flying to Pisa versus nearby milan
2018,5,Love this app! They always have the cheapest flights available!!
2018,5,Great app. Help me find cheap price.
2018,5,User friendly and shows really all the flight possibilities you might think of
2018,1,Not good app because of agent such as VIA. VIA is a bad agent cannot trust and you will get most expensive ticket.
2018,4,Great app. Demystify travel agencies.......
2018,5,Very convenient and helpful for travel purposes. :)
2018,5,It wuld be really good if the application has a feature which will when we choose destination  and departure destination automatically propose another alternative departure airport in  a nearest point.
2018,5,I travel a lot last minute and this app has the best prices by far.
2018,5,Was easy to find flights if you know the days you want to travel.
2018,4,Great app. Would give it 5 stars if it'd allow for searches with multiple stops.
2018,5,The app give me the real cheaper information options..thanks
2018,3,Why the apps do not have the option of multicity? If possible pls improve on this will be much useful in future
2018,3,The app working perfectly on IOS when I shifted to Android I could not make multi city flight bookings
2018,3,Latest update has made the widget unworkable.
2018,5,It's very helpful. Very cheap prices...
2018,3,Account required. Does not support multi stop flights.
2018,2,The app crashes all the time when I'm ready to look at a trip!
2018,4,Like the ease of flight monitoring plus the notification when new flights come in for a selected journey
2018,4,I like this app as it's easy to use and gives me a wide choice of offers for the same service.
2018,4,"Does what it needs to, couple of things which would improve it though."
2018,5,"I'd give it a 5 star if it can set a range of departure dates,  allowing the user to pick the cheapest day"
2018,4,User friendly. Used for reference.
2018,4,Very good app to choose better convenient flight for convenient journey.
2018,4,I can always find very good deals on this app
2018,4,good app for price alerts and lowest fare finding

2018,5,Helps a lot
2018,5,fanyastic fares
2018,5,Best app out there . Sends notifications. Has the best price over every other web site out there. !
2018,5,This is one of the best travel apps I have had the pleasure of using
2018,5,Brilliant
2018,2,"You can only select the cheapest month within the same month. You don't have the calendar of prices, only a bunch of flights selected automatically and the alternatives are in different months (I checked for September and only got one option for one week. The second cheapest was for May, somehow). Useless app, I'll keep using their website, much more user friendly"
2018,1,Every time we use this app for business bookings. Booking accepted than few hours later booking cancel. Or price jump up before you pay. Use to be good but now it is just waste of time specially if you are on business trip. Most seller do not have phone support to quickly fix the issue. Money returned months later.
2018,4,"I really like this service but the app doesn't  seem to be able to do the ""Multiple City"" option for flights. I ended up having to use the mobile site to find a flight for a trip where I arrive in one city and then depart from another. They honestly found me the best price though so it's hard to be upset by just an inconvenience."
2018,2,"I must be missing something - search for flights, see some options, press one and the results shown are for the next two weeks not the dates I've entered. Can't see what I'm missing! Just going to delete it. - Revision 19/2 reply to comment, I am in the search area rather than explore and have just re-installed and tried again but have the same result. There is obviously something I'm not doing right as so many people have rated it highly, so it must just be me!"
2018,5,"I travel a lot and this app definitely helps me plan my trips and connecting flights. Even after comparing with the actual airline's website, I get cheaper rates on Skyscanner.   Just be wary of lesser known airlines as they may have frequent flight delays or weird baggage policies / bad customer service which could mess up your entire trip."
2018,4,Love the ease of use of this app and that the days of the month are colour coded so you can see at a glance the best days to fly. Negative is that once you have done a search you can't amend your chosen date you have to go back to the start and do a whole new search. Also there is no option to choose a flexible day i.e. within 3 days of your date.
2018,5,"I only get to use this app twice a year, and have been loving it for a couple years.. Very fast, easy to use, and easy to understand.. I've turned a lot of people on to it. Thanks for being there, and being great!"
2018,5,"Such a lovely app. Easy to search, easy to find flights anywhere, anytime. Suggests low budget flights and its prices for the next weeks. It's just perfect üòÄ"
2018,5,Helpful app! Always use it prior to booking flights to get an idea. It's also useful to set updates on price flight changes.
2018,5,App works very well and one should have it. Multiple city options and direct flights options are less while booking for international trip.Most of the options are hopping flights. Please provide great option for direct flights
2019,1,"Used to be a fan of this app. Before they became more interested in telling me what my effing carbon footprint was The only footprint, I'm interested in. Is the one I would like to stick up there back side for letting a bunch of EnviroNazis screw up a perfectly good app."
2018,5,Good search engine. Use this if you travel. Its well worth it. Has all airlines and hotel search is handy too.
2018,5,Best Travel App for flights ever. Always searching my trips and alerting me to price drops. This app saves me literally hundreds of dollars per flight
2018,5,"This is a great app that compares all the prices instead of having to websites, i just quickly pull this app up and compare prices for flights to wherever. I wish it allowed for multiple destinations in one trip"
2018,5,This app has a lot of information needed to travel. It is useful information just in one app. I had to use several different applications to get the same result in the past.
2018,5,"Great app for comparing flight prices. Finds the best deals over all, and you can change the currency of your choice"
2018,3,Use to the iphone version of multi city flights! Like going back in time..please fix as to allow multi city bookings on adroid app.
2018,5,Best and easiest to use.  Great on mobile phone and also laptop. Cheapest prices.
2018,4,So useful. Sometimes I can get lesser prices than the web sky scanner site for the same item
2018,5,Had a trip come up unexpectedly and I got a roundtrip flight at the best price possible. Very happy with this app.
2018,4,"It is good, but the web is better for looking for ""anywhere"" and the cheapest months. I love those features"
2018,5,I average 10 flights a year get them all through this app it's easy to use and always gets good prices for flights.
2018,5,Great app for flight booking and comparison  But when you are redirected to the relevant booking site choose the most appropriate one which has good review. My recommendation
2018,5,"I love it, it compiles all the flights and prices from around the internet and let's you check in and reminds you about prices drops and raises"
2018,5,Great app for worldwide flight and hotel search. Easy and flexible
2018,2,"The performance issue has been fixed  The currency issue is still the same, each time I change it to my preferred currency it jumps right away back to dollars when I do another flight search"
2018,4,Good app to get an idea of flight prices to work out costs of trips
2018,5,Perfect app for checking all resources for flights to make sure you get the best price.
2018,5,"App is good , but still web version is much easier for navigation and search option"
2018,5,Easily to search flight and make easy to look compare the price if course make job is simple
2018,5,I like it so much! Very easy to use and much helpful info!
2018,5,Useful to compare prices from different airlines. Add more airlines if possible
2018,5,"Very good app, useful to find the flights for my trips"
2018,4,The app is excellent . My only problem is that for some days now I cannot change the currency from ¬£ to ‚Ç¨ .
2018,4,I learned about this app from someone on a train. It hasn't disappointed me yet.
2018,4,"Still learning how to use this but it seems pretty good at finding inexpensive fares, even with short notice."
2018,1,Rubbish. Won't let me search  for multicity flight
2018,5,"Great app, love all the filters and options. As a plane enthusiast I would like to be able to filter by aircraft type."
2018,5,Great app. Using since v long and benefitted everytime.
2018,5,Does the job very well. Better than any other similar apps I think.
2018,5,Love this app so much! Best place to book a holiday :)
2018,5,I am unable to get multicity option in app. Whereas it is available on the website...plz add it here aswell
2018,4,Good app for viewing the best price for multiple airlines.
2018,4,I don't have to visit multiple sites for flight offers..  it's like a one stop solution for flights
2018,4,Nice user friendly interface
2018,4,Simple and Awesome Ticketing Apps (two thumbs up üëçüëç)
2018,4,"Easy to use, not had any issues"
2018,1,I couldn't even use the app properly.
2018,5,Used this app in the past and always found what I wanted so when I needed to look at flights again I didn't hesitate to use this app again.
2018,5,This site is a better place to look for couples getaway.  Try it out.
2018,4,Need to implement Multiple destinations and cheapest month in the app.
2018,1,Too manu fake air flights and hidden charges

2018,3,"It doesn't seem like watched flights option works very well. I currently have a flight saved under filtered conditions and I will occasionally get a notification that the price has changed for it. For instance, it will show that price has dropped to $276, but when I click on the flight to view the different options, the cheapest one shown is $460. This doesn't happen with every flight I've saved, but a good majority of them for whatever reason seem to have this issue. Please fix."
2018,2,The reason for 2 stars is allot of the travel companies are semi scam companies. They use bait and switch pricing and I was frustrated at the time I had to spend researching sham companies. Use trip advisor and a private browser tab for best results. That way the website doesn't know who you are and won't inflate the price because it knows who you are. They track your searches and increase prices over time. That trick saved me $80. Same search very different prices!
2018,1,"I've had to stop using this. This explore function removes the dates I've put in, and sends me back to square one. If I'm searching for specific dates, I don't need suggestions on other dates I'm not interested in. Just show me the flippin flights! This should be the basic function. Stop trying to be a travel agent. They've all disappeared."
2018,3,"This app is fine if you know exactly when and where you want to go but one of the things that makes Skyscanner so good is the ability to search within a whole month and compare flights on different days within that month. The app allows you to search by month, but then limits process to only the cheapest. If you can't make that date, you're stuck because you can't see any others without searching them all individually. How many people have a completely free choice of date within a month? Or the time to search every combination of outward and return dates one by one? It does show cheapest process in the immediate future but no good for booking a summer holiday months ahead."
2018,1,I bought all my flights through Skyscanner web for the last X years but this app is just not well made to use it. Tell me how do you select whole month or year? Impossible right ;) Then useless.
2018,5,"Only used it once just to play around in it and check out a few prices. Wanted to see what would cost me to visit one of my friends over in Germany and the deal was so good that I actually booked the flight without any actual plans. Great app so far, booking was easy. Will give it a 5/5 for now."
2018,5,"Fantastic flight app. Saved me a bunch of money flying down to Florida. And if you're flexible and a deal hunter, you can easily find round trips for less than $60. I flew from Baltimore to Orlando for $65 to and from, that's including taxes. 10/10, would recommend to a friend."
2018,1,Prices go up the more I use the app. Installed the app on new device and was showing lower prices! It seems to me it's a dodgy strategy to push travellers to buy fast. SCAM.
2018,3,Is there any reason I can't search for multi destination flights on the app? Most flights I take these days are multi destination so the app is pretty useless to me. Desktop site is fine though.
2018,1,"If I compare to the WP Skyscanner App, then is this horrible here! I loved Skyscanner WP app and I used many times, now bye Skyscanner! I have to switch to Swoodoo. Unfortunately. Step by step I have the impression about the Android developer, they need lessons in Haptic. Maybe Andriod is overrated."
2018,5,"I consider it the best app for flights. You can book flights, look for cheap flights, and even explore ALL of the cheapest flights that leave your nearest airport. It's amazing. I definitely recommend it"
2018,5,So far so good. I have found flights that I have managed to get a travel agent to match. As well as booking a few myself that I found too good to be true at first but all worked out. Good work team.
2018,5,"Great! When you're traveling to other countries and main price for trip is airplane, you can easily find the cheapest option and book your hotel. In my opinion the best way to book a flight is by this app"
2018,5,"Helped my keep an eye on the best prices. Caught the best price, and got an alert around 2 am. Jumped on it immediately and saved hundreds."
2018,4,"App works fine, however it's very frustrating that there's seemingly no option to add multiple locations for flights, which is something I really needed."
2018,4,"Well I only have one request , please add the feature where I can check flights for +/-3 days from the day I chose , it makes things a lot faster and easier"
2018,5,An app I use on a daily basis to plan my trips! Very helpful. I hope the app will also have the multi-city function.
2018,5,"This app will give what result you expect, need to play around the filter properly. üòÄ recommended App specially for people who love travel!!!!! üòç"
2018,4,"I have only used it once, but worked well and it seemed to be the best deal on the internet.  Looking 2 purchase 2 more flights soon."
2018,5,This app definitely save you lots by giving you wide selection of alternatives and combination. You can then be diverted to agency websites or directly to official flight companies website.
2018,5,"So far, easy to use with the price sorting for cheapest flights. As a poor person with traveling love issues, I find this app perfect"
2018,5,"Very useful, being able to set so many variables right and get updates when prices change. Highly recommended."
2018,4,Pretty good app but it is not useful when you want to search multiple cities. Should include this feature asap.
2018,5,Very handy. I use only this now before planning any trip. Recommend to all
2018,5,Quick and easy way to find the best flights.  Love the rating for not just the cheapest but quickest as well!
2018,4,"Like using skyscanner, I wish the app was a bit more flexible like the website (multicity option for example) disclaimer: it's possible that I haven't fully explored the app knowing I can just use the website"
2018,5,"All in all it was a really good app did exactly what I was hoping it would do, find me the best deals on flights."
2018,5,I absolutely love this app for flight bookings - it's been my loyal travel companion for many years!
2018,5,One of the best app to search flights and hotels. User freindly interface make it very easy to use.
2018,5,Now i can book ally flights without visiting ticket agencies and at affordable price.  Thanks Skyscanner

2018,1,"It used to be very helpful but recently the prices it shows are never the updated ones, and it is also getting some scammers in its pool which always show the lowest prices but charge a ridiculous service charge. I spent the past 3 days trying to booking a ticket but after keying in my particulars with more the 20 websites, still, I haven't got it booked, just because of the outdated prices. I used to recommend this app to my friends but I'm telling them to stop using it."
2018,5,"Probably my most used app when planning to travel.  My favorite feature would be the option to select airports nearby.  Also gives suggestions as to leaving on cheaper days.  If you are wanting to go somewhere but don't know  where, skyscanner let's you see options to domestic as well as international flights. Love this app better than hopper."
2018,4,Have used this app to successfully check cheapest flights.   I like that it warns you when you should be aware of long layovers and early/starts.  I use it frequently.  It can be a little slow at times and i still struggle to get anywhere re baggage allowance for individual airlines.  Then again their individual websites are rarely clear
2018,3,"The app was simply fabulous , but the recent update has really messed up with the widget.I can't even configure a widget ,every time I enter a destination location it shows me to explore the location and then I press back the button it exits the configuration. Imho this app is not at all usable to me if this function is so messed up."
2018,3,"Great app and we've booked lots of flights using the main website. Can only give it 3 stars as we would like to see the option to search for multi city flights as on your website, surely this could be added? If that was added, it would get the full 5 stars."
2018,2,The app was once great but they've invested a lot of time and effort to make it rubbish. The search criteria was very manipulatable by the user but searches are not very good anymore. Difficult to find good days to fly when spanning across a month with no destination in mind.
2018,4,"Although I cannot book multicity flights, the App is excellent in providing flight options that do not show up elsewhere. Moreover, the App will include multicity searches and returns from airport different than that arrived at. I eagerly await both."
2018,5,Great app but I'm not getting notifications on price changes any more which is one of the key features. I don't want to miss out on cheap flights. Help!
2018,5,I love it! Super helpful for finding way cheap flights even internationally. Never thought I'd leave the country but here I am booking a flight to Japan for under 1K for two people!
2018,4,"The prices are higher than the ones I keep finding on desktop, thus from time to time the app becomes obsolete. Please fix, we expect the best out of you"
2018,3,"I love the app and the prices, but I am unable to change the currency even though changed the country. So please fix this amd then it deserves the 5 star."
2018,3,Excellent app with one major flaw. I can't book multi destination flights on the app. To me this is a big flaw. Please add it
2018,5,It's a great app. If you know to how select the flight routes you will cheap rates. I am really liking it.
2018,5,"Of all the apps to check cheap flights, this app gave me the cheapest price. Great app! :)"
2018,5,Love this app.. always have great deals.. i traveled to Europe last year.. and this year im traveling to Thailand.. I really recommend it!!!
2018,4,App is good but prices shown are often not the same when try to book.  Always higher never cheaper (((
2018,3,Can't see prices on full calendar just the color dot and the range. Please put prices back on each individual day for whole month search.
2018,5,Great app for all my travel planning! Just wish it would support multi - city bookings.
2018,5,Very easy to use and looks for exactly what your looking for. Just make sure to feed skyscanner the correct info.
2018,5,"Very good, easy, and informative app. Great for comparing prices and have better options on flights."
2018,1,Doesn't update flight price quick enough 24 hours slower than checking flights myself utter rubbish
2018,4,Seems pretty good. Easy to read. Would like to be able to narrow down rates a bit more.
2018,5,So helpful. Best way to look up flights. Love it.
2018,1,"Was great but now when you go to book, the great price you found is MUCH higher.  Now near useless"
2018,5,Useful for quick checks and planning trips. Great for showing deals from your local airport.
2018,5,Sometimes pricing is slightly off with the price but love the app. Very easy to use.
2018,5,I've been looking for an app like this for a long time. Previously I've had to look one day at a time through each airline and almost inevitably got burned out and gave up.
2018,1,The price shown on this app disappear when u go to the flight provider and then the double price is shown. A trick or what
2018,3,"Good for finding good days to fly, but don't try to book with any of the scammy agencies that show up first. Book with the airlines."
2018,5,"Easy to navigate, clear and FREE! My number one app for looking at flights!"
2018,4,My primary app when finding flights. Amazing!
2018,5,Very convenient and very easy to buy a ticket. Provides the best possible prices
2018,1,The latest update makes widgets impossible to set up according to the dates I want.
2018,3,"So far this app has been great, haven't seen anything wrong with it been using it for awhile."
2018,5,Pretty decent. Shows the prices all together saves time etc.
2018,5,This app is good. It helped me to see and compare option for my trip
2018,5,Interface should be improved as it confused sometime when there is flights with stops.
2018,2,"This app was great, and the last change broke it. Please make it great again.."
2018,5,This is a one stop travel app. Amazing!
2018,5,Best fight booking app yet. Thanks Skyscanner.
2018,4,Great app. Consolidates all flights.
2018,3,Not sure why multi city search is not available on the app. Will change to 5 star when this is updated.
2018,1,Worst app  first it shows 2880Rs fare after click on that it doubles almost the actual fare...
2018,3,"Limited usefulness - cannot properly login to my account, it says ""cookies disabled"""
2018,5,Cheapest flights available. Easy to use interface.
2018,1,This company sends out spam via malware to promote this app. Uninstalled.

2018,2,There is multi-destnation flight search for iphone but it haven't for android
2018,5,Very good app. Gives you very good prices
2018,1,"Had to delete because app couldn't be moved to SD card, if you fix this I'll reinstall"
2018,4,"The apps doesn't have ""anywhere"" option. Only web provide that..."
2018,5,"Such an easy app to use, especially great when you're trying to suss out options and have flexibility! üòä"
2018,4,Very useful. Thank you

2018,5,Awsome *****
2018,5,This is the only app I use when looking for cheap flights
2018,5,Helps alot!!
2018,5,Smashing
2018,4,It is working again.
2018,5,Thanks alot
2018,5,Go to app for travel planning üëå
2018,5,I use skyscanner religiously for flights
2018,5,All you need when booking flights
2018,5,Never seen anything like this before
2018,4,All in detail
2018,4,Thanks for Making

2018,5,I like it
2018,5,EXELLANT
2018,5,Excellnent app
2018,5,One app
2018,5,Korisna aplikacija
2018,5,I like  this app
2017,4,This app is great for comparing flights from different companies without going on each individual website although sometimes prices aren't fully up to date but it gives a good idea. The app doesn't seem to allow me to look at a range of dates like flying anytime within a month like you can select online and I would like an option to search multiple airports without searching the whole country like birmingham and Manchester rather than the whole of the uk
2017,3,"I wasn't able to cancel price alerts from my account page. Multi-city searches can't be done via the app. The Momondo app allows multi-city  searches. However, the price results on Skyscanner seem better."
2017,5,I love everything about this app! It tells you EVERYTHING you need to know about your flights as well as finding the cheapest ones available. It also watches your flights for any changes for you. I can't believe the details. I love this app!!
2018,2,Unfortunately App isn't as half as good as the website! Why can't I search for a specific alliance in the app?? Why can't search for open jaw flights? With these features it's just an app like any other of the 10 million out there
2017,2,"Much preferred the old app. It's more difficult to check a wide number of variables now and it keeps giving me options I've no interest in. Example, looking for flights in the summer and I'm shown potions for January!"
2018,5,"So far so good using this app. I like being able to compare the prices of so many flights, even being able to favorite certain flights to keep up with price changes, etc.  I'll update review after my flight :)"
2017,4,In price alerts it would be great to define the amount minimum of being informed. A lot of times I get noticed for price changes of 3 dollars which is less than 1% of the entire flight and not really helpful
2018,4,Over all its good. But some of the websites take longer time to book your tickets so in that case it is not safe if you are booking for a next moment travel.
2017,5,"This app is good for booking flights and hotels, easy comparing and simplified app. Very less bugs ( I can't find any) use for best trip planning."
2018,4,Better on iPhone than Google phone. On my old iPhone I could search for a multiple flight trip. On this app it's only single or return. Otherwise a great app.
2018,3,"Search page is user friendly and readable, however please ensure that we are linked to the flight we selected and the price shown.  Booked 5 flights with you guys, only this time I somehow booked a flight arriving at an airport near the one I selected."
2017,4,"In overall a great app. Search response is quick. The UI design layout is good. Search filter options are great. Simple, quick and elegant."
2017,5,All compared prices at one place make job so easier. It enables to book the ticket at best price. Brilliant.
2018,5,Wow. Kemarin Saya Pesan Tiket Jakarta ke LA. Dapat nya 9.1jt PP pake pesawat China Southern. Jauh lebih murah dari Aplikasi2 Lain nya... Proses nya mudah dan gak Ribet. Tinggal siapin Pasport & Kartu Kredit. 10 menit beres
2017,5,"I only really use this to search for potential flights instead of booking through it, but it saves alot of time when searching. I can't do without it."
2017,5,A super easy way to book your trip and save. I use Expedia and compare. In most cases Sky Scanner is cheaper.
2018,1,This app was brilliant until they updated it - a good app ruined it. Update Jan 2018 still useless - not worth the download - AVOID
2017,5,"No doubt the best app for cheap flights! First and only review I've ever written, keep it up guys!"
2017,1,it always shows wrong price. after redirection price is always a few dollars higher for flights as well as for hotels. awful experience.
2018,4,"Good But Not Spectacular--mostly like other flight search apps, except for the nice simple interface"
2017,3,Everything is more expensive than it first says and involved trips that take 5 times as long as they should. DODGY.
2018,5,"So easy to navigate, and saves you do much time and money. Never looking for flights any other way."
2018,4,App is great for getting pricing comparisons. Would really appreciate if it could have airports available by country - sometimes you don't know the city name.
2018,5,"So far so good, I've been able to find cheapest prices tho I haven't booked a flight yet."
2018,4,Very useful for comparing prices and planning your flights.. especially if you're a budget traveller
2017,5,Great app to compare prices! Just beware of some 'bait and switch' scams due to links with online agencies.
2017,5,It's amazing app would be nice if it had multiple stop on the app rather than the flight.. but excellent app
2017,5,Good app that lets you see all the deals and also gives the option of saving the search. Also will give price alerts on your saved sesrches
2018,1,Flight search doesn't work without location access. I'd rather use the web version.
2017,5,App is real brilliant. There are small differences in prices between scanner and official websites but not very much
2017,5,Great fares. Notifications.  Found a good flight for my Mom in Puerto Rico.
2018,5,Happy to change the review from 1 to 5 stars after the excellent response of Skyscanner team to my problem. Thank you
2018,5,It's great app for comparing flights & prices and regular updates are available too. Easy to use.
2018,4,One of the best tools for anyone who loves travelling. Provides a list of prices/options for the destination chosen.
2018,4,Its really easy to use and information is spot on.... downside it access to every other file to use the app.
2018,4,Good app. However needs to have the ability to search multi flights like the SS website.
2017,1,Ill give 5 star if you remove sasti ticket from the list because they are giving wrong price information which is not correct for the app like your
2018,2,Poorly designed app. The website is easier to use and allows more options when searching. Uninstalling.
2017,5,Great app. The option to see cheap to expansive flights right in your calendar is amazing.
2017,1,Checked google and the same destination  travel dates were $300 less expensive.
2017,5,It gives almost prices from all major online airline ticket merchants.... I just love it.
2017,4,Great app ! Only one problem can't find the multi-city option anymore.... Could you bring it back ?
2018,5,Love using this app. Easy to use and they find some of the best deals.
2018,4,Just started  to use the app. It looks quite good.  The colour can be better.
2017,5,"Nice UI, easy to use. 1 stop station to check and book flights"
2017,5,"Easy to use, always seems to find really great deals.  Excellent."
2018,5,Great app for finding deals on travel. Simple and easy to navigate
2018,5,Love how cheap the flights are compared to other sights 90% of the time it is much cheaper and AMAZING car deals
2018,5,"Quick, manageable, lots of travel options. Overall great app."
2018,5,Great app.  My first port of call looking for flights and hotels.
2017,5,Really nice app their prize is very cheap. It is the best app I have ever seen. Really amazing.
2018,1,Useless unless you grant loads of unnecessary permissions to the app. Nope.
2018,4,hopefully there is an option for currency so there is no need for me to check on the currency converter. hopefully there is auto detect the location.
2018,5,Quick way to find cheap flights. Very handy!
2017,5,"This was my favorite app for finding/booking flights, but as the Multi-City Search function is not available within the app, I've had to start using other apps like Momondo to make my bookings."
2017,5,I have looked at so many apps nd websites but none can come close to this gold. Do check this one everytime!
2017,5,Always i using this app for find and buy any flight ticket. Thank you  skyscanner team
2018,5,"Very cheap flights and I like the calendar feature, good for comparing  dates if you are flexible"

2017,5,Really good app for booking flights in cheap prices
2017,5,It is useful. I always use this app when I plan to travel.
2018,2,Only shows 4 airlines. Tried it for Southwest and it was not a search option.
2018,3,"The app is good,but there is no multi city to book for different distinctions"
2018,5,Finds flights. Simple. No log in required.
2018,4,Only thing missing is the fares shown only in pounds. It should have multiple currency option
2017,4,"Wonderful app to get great flight rates, possibilities ."
2017,2,This app does not help with multi travels so no good for me.
2018,1,Dates and destination given and no response ?  Your are rubbish.

2018,5,Keep on update
2017,5,muito bom
2017,5,Flights are everywhere
2017,5,
2018,1,It is shame to interfere political issues with common service like this applications . Why results of Qatar Airways doesn't appear in search results ?  I have exhausted so that I can  book a trip using Sky scanner.   Once I used Wego Application. I find it easily . Please revise your polices in case you want to keep on your customers confidence.
2017,4,"Overall very efficient and useful for scouting flight prices, with a few pitfalls or bugs. For some reason when it prompts to update search results, it changes the search criteria without notifying the user. For me it added an additional person, an infant, and business class, and I nearly changed my trip plans because I thought flights had gotten crazy expensive."
2017,3,"It's very good and useful, I like it, but the widgets stopp working on my phone, well, actually the widgets are ok, it didn't crash, but it won't refresh it's self I think, the widgets always told me no results of this search, but I could get this search results inside the App. So, could you please address this bug and fix it? It's really important for us, because I think add a widgets on your screen and wait it refresh automatically would be very convenient, hope you fix this thanks, if you need any information about my phone, please email me"
2017,2,Bad app. UI sucks. Need a huge learning curve to use this app. This app is made for only US. The dollar don't change to any other currency even after changing it in the setting...
2017,4,"Good and easy app to check flight fares. The alerts are great but if only it includes the filters in place including timing preferences and choice for direct flights only, which often means alerts report lower prices than is actually available with the filters on, effectively rendering the alert useless."
2017,3,"Multi city search option is available for I phones but not for Android. No idea how hard it is for you guys. But If you can Add that, will be wonderful and great App.."
2017,5,"Been using this app since 2013. Still gives the cheapest price as compare to all other websites such as expedia. Easy to use, good filter options, cheapest. Going to book tickets again on Friday. 101% recommended."
2017,1,"I used to LOVE THIS APP...It was my favorite. But then I changed phones to the Google pixel 2 and ????? Where's the ""cheapest month"" option? Where's the ""everywhere"" option? Is it the phone? Did the app update? I had to uninstall and I was so sad. It used to be my favorite app!"
2017,5,"As of now one of the best app for flight search travel planing ...... But I want the team to include ""pay at airline office"" option if possible so that people who don't use credit cards can buy tickets online"
2017,5,Great app. Very well executed. It would be very helpful for it to tell you the lowest prices around. The destination isn't always as important as the cost and the adventure.
2017,4,"It's useful for prices and timelines. It' alerts well, however I prefer the website to the app. Both are great though."
2017,4,The actual rates end up being a little more when all is said and done.  But generally the app works well and gives good info.
2017,5,"Love it. Best deals ever. Just needs to expand its months a little further. Other then that, awesome."
2017,4,"A very good app, though it should be used in conjunction with flight tracking sites because prices do vary."
2017,4,"Great app, very smooth. Shows amazing deals, just need a few more filters to b perfect."
2017,5,One of the  best app to find the affordable rates for flights and hotels by comparing all other portals rates. Thank you Skyscanner for making things easy
2017,5,Always my go-to site for checking flights. So easy to use - good work guys!
2017,5,"This app is great! You actually don't need to look any further for flights that fit your needs, this is it folks!!!"
2017,5,Fantastic app. Finds the cheapest of the cheapest flights from respected airlines. Had no problems with it
2017,5,"The best app of it kind, fast with good widget accurately, a must to have if you like to travel having the best deals"
2017,4,"why does it automatically fill the dates up with 2135 year?0_o it takes a lot of time to scroll back to present or you need to choose ""tomorrow"" date and scroll further"
2017,5,I always use this app whenever I need to travel or I want to know the price of flight tickets to any destinations I dream.
2017,5,Very useful and easy to use. Has definitely saved me money and time when searching for flights.
2017,5,Very great app. Help's me find better and affordable deals for traveling.
2017,5,"Love skyscanner, best prices available, easy to use.  Would recommend"
2018,5,"This app it's good,  it really helps us to get the best price for flight."
2017,5,I simply cannot book a flight ticket without checking the prices here first..

2017,5,Very responsive
2017,5,t app
2017,2,"Was great when you could choose direct flights and everywhere as a destination, as it told you where you could fly to from any given city. Now that function has gone from the normal search, I can apparently fly anywhere in the world from any airport, so long as I'm willing to have lots of changes! Can you put that option back on the initial choice screen?  Unable to respond via email to your response, but thank you for getting back to me.   The issue I'm having isn't that I can't use the everywhere function (I can still type ""everywhere"" as well as use the explore top deals function), it's that when selecting number of passengers etc. I used to be able to select direct flights only, which would limit the results set to destinations that the chosen airport would fly to - something that was extremely useful for me when traveling. However, I now have to choose ""everywhere"", then select a destination before I can choose ""direct flights only"" so I cannot see what destinations are flown to directly... Is there some way I can access that function?"
2017,2,"Used to be very clear and easy to use, now the interface is better looking, but way harder to understand. I deeply regret the previous view with a graph of the prices for every days of the month. Now they joystick give you the cheapest one and that's it..."
2017,2,"The app is not opening. Like even if you click it. It only opens if you go to the site and then it once transferred to the app, but now it's not doing that as well. I'm trying to check out some flights, please fix this. Thank you."
2017,2,"Yes, I know search can be done by selecting country. In Europe, we can see many countries, which has the area,not even 100 miles of radoius from the center. if you add ""EUROPE""  as a option, that really serves purpurse of ""BEST PRICE"""
2017,4,Maybe not perfect but still very good and I like using this app. Helps me a lot. With this version I can change the currency which gave me difficulties before
2017,5,Love this app it has helped me save hundreds on flights. I went to Germany with my 2 girls and spent only 900 on a round trip flight.  Also if anything try to go with kiwi cause they also help
2017,1,"Because it shows a really cheap price in your searching tool, but when I look into the price it's 5 times more expensive."
2017,5,"Something wrong with skyscanner? Been trying to seach flights since last night, the result always shown in loading mode."
2017,4,I don't get the alerts of price change. Plzz do something .. Otherwise the app is gud and perfect !
2017,5,Awesome. I like the fact they show the model of plane that is operating on a particular flight. Please get this feature to the website as well.
2017,4,"Everything is just perfect! You should give the price on calendar, date by date."
2017,5,Absolutely love this app. Very easy to use and save a lot of time and money. Keep up the good work guys!!

2017,3,"The best feature of previous versions was the bar graph showing prices. This is almost completely hidden, buried behind the date picker via a tiny icon top right. It took me quite a while to find that graph again. You should put it front and center again as it's what makes the app so useful and unique."
2017,4,"It's a nice app, it does go on the fritz once in a while and change my number of people flying. Had to uninstall and reinstall once already. But overall a great app to see what deals are put there without going to a million sites."
2017,4,"I like this app  Easy to use. Put your dates into it, gives you flight updates sent to your email. Only had this a few weeks so much more to find out."
2017,3,No everywhere option. If you add that it will be used otherwise back to Web app for me. Super fast reply from developers so one more star just for that. Perhaps I can't type (or tried anywhere). Will upgrade rating  once I have had another go.
2017,5,It really help you on planning your trip with the cheapest flights. Pay attention only if the ticket price is from the own airline or from third parties. I only book those from airlines for increased satisfaction.
2017,3,Please add multi-city flight option for the app. I don't really like checking on the website. It's a shame.Thanks!
2017,4,"Excellent app , appreciate you all very useful for traveling abroad and find out cheapest fare throughout the year.... Thanks"
2017,5,"I've been using this app for the last 3 yes and it's the best way to find flight at the most convenient price, very helpful and easy to use."
2017,5,This application is just great. It's easy to use and arrange your trips. I strongly recommend it! Thanks
2017,3,Why does the Android version not have the multi-city choice as the iOS version does?  It's quite an important feature for cheap-flight trips...
2017,5,Solid app for soooooooo long. Have used the desktop site for well over ten years and rarely go elsewhere. The 'everywhere function is so much fun too.
2017,5,Easy to use. And great prices and lots of information to book a hotel and/ or flights. Saves time.
2017,5,"Love this app, I used it sevetal times and satisfied so far from prices. No problems in any of the tickets."
2017,5,"I appreciate the features in this app, such as the best deals based on the month you plan to travel. I have booked several vacations using this app."
2017,4,"Solid app, consistently among the best airline fares. Deduct one star because I have had negative experiences with some of the third parties used."
2017,5,Its a very well designed app. User Experience so far is off the charts!
2017,5,Cheap prices for different locations. I've boo booked my flights from this app before.

2017,5,Powerful application.. Helped me find cheap tickets. Satisfied!
2017,2,Too many scam and fraud 3rd party websites included and not kicking them out even if reported.
2017,5,"Brilliant app. So easy to use, I think I may even prefer this to Expedia - something I thought  would NEVER happen"
2017,5,Awesome way to search for flights. Search everywhere feature should be added.

2017,1,How can your app allows 'exploretrip' to get a highest rating of more than 4.5 stars with most reviews but it ending up causing a lot of customers getting scammed including me. My credit card have been credited and until now I have not received my etickets. I am really dissapointed with expedia and hope you can help us to prevent this thing from happening and help us to solve this problem. Please check. Any of you out there please be careful to use expedia and its partners to buy any tickets. Better to buy directly from official airlines websites.
2017,5,"I love it. I have booked many flights through this app and never had any problems. Everything is straight forward, ≈ôrom choosing your destinations to the booking. I use the app nearly every month and there is no better choice for finding the right flight or even the right hotel"
2017,4,"I really love this app... the only problem is that it doesn't seem to pick up any flight options to/from Guam/Rota/Saipan (Mariana Islands). Please add those US territories, thank you."
2017,4,"Cool app.. But not accurate pricing at all times. Prices changes when we proceed to book and confirm. For double safety, must cross check with other similar apps too."
2017,1,"L√§cherlich. Lockvogel Angebote. Ich hatte die App Monate lang drauf, hatte immer die Preise beobachtet. Als die Tickets dann sehr g√ºnstig waren (~610‚Ç¨) wollte ich vor ein paar Tage buchen, direkt nach Erhalt der Mail, und jedes Mal kam nur ""Die Tickets sind zu diesem Preis nicht mehr verf√ºgbar"" Nach mehrmaligem Versuchen als ich dann bei Tickets um die 900‚Ç¨ angelangt war, hab ich mich dann selber umgeschaut und sie letztenendes f√ºr 760‚Ç¨ erstanden. Also die App fliegt erst mal. Zeit und Platzverschwendung. Die Angebote existieren anscheinend gar nicht."
2017,2,"Nice app, but just received a push notification to advertise ""Find the cheapest flight blabla..."". Was easier to uninstall than to look for the preference menu to disable notifications in the app. Thank your advertising department for the 2 stars."
2017,5,"I this app! I use it for all my flights these days because I rarely find any better prices outside skyscanner. I haven't tried the hotels feature, though."
2017,2,"I do not want to give permission to my location and the dialog to request it keeps appearing everytime. It is very annoying, please fix this bug and I'll rate 5 stars."
2017,5,Awesome website! The App is even better!!! Skyscanner has facilitated my growing love for travelling with it's smooth and convenient interface. I've recommended it to countless friends and family. So thanks to all you folks at Skyscanner!!!
2017,2,I really love the website but this App is nowhere near as useful. Really hard to restrict searches to direct only unless you know the exact airports you'll be using. I'll stick to the website for now.
2017,4,Great app and love it. However it won't ever get 5 stars until multi flight facility is added like on the website.
2017,5,I've used this app over the years to book countless flights. Can't praise it enough. Easy to use and efficient!
2017,5,"Scans best price deals, also the email-alert options comes very handy and useful for tracking one's own choice of itinerary :)"
2017,5,"Great app, very timely notification for price increase or decrease, have booked international tickets thrice at very low price by the notification, Thanks.......have a suggestion can you please add ""Multiple Destinations"""
2017,5,So far just searches for potential flights and dates is so much easier. I have not purchased using the app yet but plan to as our plans become more set
2017,5,It's a great app for people who want the best deals for their flights. Keep up the good work guys!
2017,1,They definitely don't give you the cheapest flights. I found plenty of cheaper flights just searching through Google .
2017,4,It's the right place to check for cheap tickets I recommend you to use this app if you travel often and if you want cheap flights üòäüòäüòä
2017,5,Finally a travel app that finds the best deals based on country and not specific Airport! Love it :)
2017,4,"Great app but I can't seem to use it the same as the website, like being able to select a whole month rather than specific dates when searching"
2017,4,Good app to keep you up on the prices. Great cistomer service when book the wrong flight.
2017,1,It USED TO BE AWSOME! Now it doesnt even work! Gives you fake prices!
2017,1,"If the prices are not going to be what you see, what's the point? Better to use a local aggregator"
2017,5,Compared same day flighrs with google flights and google couldnt show the cheapest flight i found on skyscanner. So its a no brainer for me what to use.
2017,5,Simple and straightforward. Easy to track prices with alerts and I love the rating system used to compare flights.
2017,3,You can search cities by your default phone language setting only. Quite annoying.
2017,5,"This app helped me plan my trip to Europe with complete exactitude and a nice price, all with months in advance"
2018,4,Pretty good. Stable search with filters. No multi city search yet otherwise would be 5 stars
2017,4,"Great app , I have booked my flight many times with good price."
2017,1,It is the absolute worst ad magnet. I was plagued with pop ups until I uninstalled this. As an app it is great but the volume of  ads is unacceptable.
2017,4,It would be wonderful to have the possibility to search for flight to anywhere like in in the website. Hope in the new update
2017,1,These are not good prices!.. Skyline is so much cheaper.
2018,5,It's become one of my favorite apps to plan my trips. Love the notifications!
2017,5,Easy smooth app to use so far. Was able to book a flight with ease.
2017,5,"Nice app, clear and user friendly. Also not too much ads."
2017,4,I change my opinion! It is well useable! Fast and good offers!
2018,1,The oneway prices shown on the widget are nothing short of BS - classic example of bait prices
2017,5,what about colorblind user?? how we can use the price range colour??please change it!!!
2017,5,Deals are as good or better as those found in travel search engines
2017,4,"The app is quite useful to search the bargining flights And accomodations,  only that no multiple flight could be selected..."
2017,4,"Very useful app, i like skyscanner, but could find more cities in search!"
2017,5,Amazing app offering the best deals and variety of flights
2017,3,"Price is not always accurate, but it helps you compare schedules and benchmarks on the price"
2017,1,Not able to select my own combination while booking round trips
2017,5,Fantastic. Almost gives correct pricing. Great app to plan ur next holiday

2017,5,"So I came to a frustrating plateau in my first time ever to shop for plane tickets and I possibly picked the worst season of the year to find ""affordable flights"" - Christmas! Nights of searching and planning how best to plan our flights, I found the prices jumped higher in price with every click of the search button. I tried a few websites such as Kayak and Travelocity and was so confused and frustrated by the lackluster of numbers, times, dates and compared costs on my 15"" laptop screen, that could barely hold in view the spew of information, until I found Skyscanner! This app has alleviated my first ticket buying experience from hair pulling to ""oh that was easy"". The interface is nice, they list out everything clearly and give hints as to what's a good deal or has a horribly long lay over. If you are new or seasoned alike at buying plane tickets I would recommend this app in your arsenal. To the developers - great job, my only real complaint is the filter ability and the way it organizes times. I found that some better times, for me personally, were lower in the list with a ""lesser"" rating but still way easier than any online site I used."
2017,3,Trying to get cheap direct flight to Thailand but every price quoted say for example it says ¬£450 when you try and book price goes up to ¬£621 I just tried over 6 quotes and all want ¬£200 or more when you book none of the prices are live so what's the point of quoting prices if you can't obtain those prices
2017,3,"I have tried to apply price alert few times.. Yet it will pop up ""unable to create price alert"" please do solve this issue soonest. Thank you."
2017,3,Should be 4+ stars for range of flight options but it keeps sending irritating notifications for deals and price reminders even although these are switched off in settings.   It gets to the stage that I uninstall it after a flight search then reinstall it later when I want to search for something else.
2017,5,"Just works right first time, every time. The only feature I don't really like is the forcing to the Skyscanner browser. It's OK but I rather use my own browser."
2017,1,Booked a deal with travel agent through this app. Agent has ripped me off and now I can't get my money back. I would never have booked with this agent if it wasn't for this app.
2017,1,"Infinite loop of selecting flexible dates. Despite on clicking Don't show again button, the app keeps annoying me with popup about Location settings."
2017,5,"Only thing I suggest is that it show the prices of the flights on the dates like it does on the web rather than green, yellow, and red dots. Other than that it's a really great app  :)"
2020,1,After 5 years that I always used skyscanner I cancelled that couse now you can not check anymore the best day for have a better price. I'm surprise that they removed the function
2017,2,Please help. I use the tools in the app to find the cheapest flight. It says flight A to B is 245$ and B back to A is 312$ but when I search the flight the cheapest price 866$. This been like this for years now.
2017,1,"Ridiculous! It asks me to adjust my dates so it can offer me nonstop flights. I do it, then it says sorry, we couldn't find non stop flights. And I can find nonstop flights for the same dates using other apps."
2017,5,I love the fact that I can track the flights. Alerts me of any updates. And the amount. I've recommended this to many of my friends and family. I travel A lot.
2017,1,"Estou tentando comprar duas passagens a mais de uma semana e n√£o consigo, pois sempre d√° o mesmo erro quando eu tento. O pre√ßo j√° est√° o dobro do que eu tentei comprar pela primeira vez e continua subindo.... decepcionante."
2017,5,You guys are great but please do not use Explore Trip as a reference. Those people on that travel agency are very disrespectful and thief.
2017,2,Doesn't show return trip for android phone. Disappointing. seem like it work better for iPhone.
2017,5,"Very easy to use app, visually informative. I hope research team can add one more feature for flexible travelers"
2017,1,price changes..flight not even available...and thats after u type all the details in...what a waste
2017,5,Booked our volunteer trip to Thailand  for under 500 USD each for roundtrip. I love the hell outta this app.
2017,2,Today app is bad! Galaxy s6 when chose anywhere fly then no names of countries and cityes!
2017,1,Prices are fraudulent. A price of ¬£135 was actually ¬£165. This is unethical and need to be stopped !
2017,5,Very easy to use. Does everything you would expect a travel app to do without trouble.
2017,5,"Very useful, fast app with neat features. keep ot goin guys :)"
2017,4,It's very helpful to find the flight and good price. üëçüëçüëç

2017,5,Excellent app. So easy to compare prices.
2017,3,Easy way to find good price flight
2017,5,Great app. Saves time and gets great deals.
2017,3,"Ok, once details are put in, but tends not to remember details and have to keep inputting info"
2017,4,Recommend to have an option to search multi cities just like iOS's Skyscanner.
2017,3,Multi City Option for android app would be a big help similar to ios version of the app.
2017,3,Does not have 'whole month' feature. Wat!?
2017,5,"It's a üëçbest search Engine üòé gives best ticket price and save the time to look around, Thumbs up."

2017,4,Very practical but U can find cheaper deals.

2017,5,"An awesome app, makes life easier in terms of booking flights, i don't have to stand in long queues"
2017,3,Can't change price currency from ¬£ to $/‚Ç¨/¬•/.../…É or whatever many-used currency :/
2017,5,"Good app which helps you find flights from various carriers, easy to use very easy on the eyes with regards to the layout."
2017,5,Best app for quick flight search & better airfare than it's competitors.
2017,5,Accurate... you don't have to do a lot of research after Skyscanner.
2017,5,Awesome... But I personally liked the old design more

2017,3,"App is sure good. It could deserve a better rare if: A) It would have the multi-city option that exist if you use web version, as it not exist on app, don't know why; B) If you could have the possibility to add options choosing a flight, like to add luggages. Because for flights in Europe, you show the lowest price, right, but systematically without carried on luggages! It would be correct to have the choice. Because of that, I very often look on app the flights as they are complete in term of timetables... and buy my tickets over other apps or on aircraft website as there I can add carried on luggages that I can't add through your choices... Really pity! I strongly recommend and suggest to correct this bug..."
2017,5,"Great app, nice and easy to work with. I know this app will keep on improving. The only suggestion I wil make, is if the app will combine both holiday and flights as packages. This will make life much easier. Your competitors do this really well. Other then that 5/5 from me"
2017,1,"Used to use this app frequently for flights. Now just keep getting a message telling me they think I'm a ""bot"" Submitted details to clarify I'm not but haven't heard anything in weeks. Such a pity. Very disappointing."
2017,5,"Excellent app, only suggestion: choose a period when you're able to travel (ex. 29 sep - 10 oct) and select the prefered length of your trip (ex. 3 days), so it'll calculate the cheapest price in this period (ex. 87‚Ç¨ from 1 oct - 3 oct) and please add an option to get the lowest price of hotel + flight together"
2017,5,I have used many similar apps before but this one is the best. Very user friendly and straight forward and also has support for my local currency which most of the other apps did not which saves me the hassel of conversation rates.  Great app Great work keep it up!
2017,1,"It used to be good! Now it doesn't show all the cheap options. If my Google search skills are better than this app, then I'm definitely not using it."
2017,1,"Apparently you shouldn't wait just one day with buying the tickets. I had been looking for tickets for a long time and had finally found good tickets on Scyscanner. I was really excited about it, but the next day the price was double as much :("
2017,5,"I really liked the ""anywhere"" choice because sometimes i just wanna know where can i go directly from my city. I did not find this ability anywhere else. Big thanks."
2017,5,"I like the app not trying to hide any part of the deals, remind you if you need to change airport, long waiting between flights etc. Lot of app just try to sell you the ticket and you will discover the difficult part later. Very good app, recommended!"
2017,5,Brilliant app that gives good additional information on flights that no other sites give.  I love that the site keeps previous searches too so it is easy to go back and search for fares at later date without having to input all information again.
2017,2,"Can't search for specific car hire locations like you can on the Web, everything looks cheap but is all from airports which isn't useful. Can't clear cookies so it screws you when you recheck flights"
2017,5,Since 3 years I use this app and never used a better one for flight search. Everything is so organised and easy. Thumbs up!!
2017,1,Filtering doesn't work. Keep trying to filter out certain airports but it doesn't refresh. Difficult to figure out how to alter airports and flights after searching.
2017,5,Great app. Alerted me to a lower rate a few days after downloading. Booked my flights for $200 cheaper!
2017,2,Absolute rubbish since the 'improvements' was great now unable to even search for flight. Absolute garbage.  Hello google
2017,1,"I used to love this app, now it keeps annoying me about my location, and the best features -  easily accessible flexible dates and destinations are gone."
2017,2,Much too complex. I liked the simple and clean layout from the previous versions. Deleted the app. I prefer to use the Web interface.
2017,5,In love w this app already. Know why? No fake airfare prices like other popular apps.
2017,5,"I might not always buy thrue this site, but i always use to check for best offers. Quick and easy. Thanks"
2017,2,It is not possible to search multiple destination flights. It is possible via website but not via app. Thanks for your considerations!
2017,5,Been using this app for last 8 years .. always find good rates.. could b more betta.  If they add multi city obtion.
2017,4,It's biggest downfall for me is I end up going on holiday more because of it being too easy to book flights. üòÅ
2017,5,Awesome. Easy to use. Cheapest by a long way. Best travel app EVER!
2017,5,Good app First time to book and so far so good. Waiting for my flight sched. Til then
2017,4,Fast app to aid in finding flights. Will be good if it can also find for multi cities
2017,4,Nice look and feel and showing the plane type is welcomed.  Not 5* because the multi tab search was removed. Please bring it back.
2017,5,Easy to use. Always has the best prices. Just fab!
2017,5,Saves lots of time because it lists the cheapest flights and has all the information. Very easy to use!
2017,1,"Ojo que las p√°ginas como exploretrip, a las que skyscanner promueve y recomienda, te generan cargos dobles a tus tarjetas de cr√©dito. Esto lo hacen sin que uno se de cuenta y te puede complicar la vida"
2017,4,The app is pretty comprehensive and outway other flight apps in terms of customization. Skyscanner may consider adding more sources to look for international flights.
2017,5,This is the very best app. I have ever found to find cheap flights tickets!
2017,5,Works well so far. Good information and flight options ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2017,4,"It's nice. Please, help me how to add luggage. Thanks."
2017,5,Easy to use. Prices seem to be competitive. I like it!
2018,5,"I liked the app but there aren't Turkmenistan Airlines flights. Can you add 
it?"
2017,5,"Amazing one stop app that could help me to find cheapest airfare and giving me idea on the destination to visit for holiday because it has an ""Everywhere"" optuon!"
2017,5,Easy to find out the best choice for a trip. No need to open several sources to compare.
2017,5,Reay love it....  porichu....  trustworthy and less price always.
2017,5,Love the app!! Easy to use and always has found the best price for me!!
2017,5,"Used this app for years. Got a new phone reload this , love the new design."
2017,5,Real easy to check airline fares. Shows me all the deals
2017,5,Very good app. Consolidated view of all aggregation flight systems
2017,5,I've been using it all the time. Very convenient app. Recommending
2017,3,Price on widget does not tally with real price when I open the app even though the widget price just updated
2017,3,Good idea but doesn't seem to check all possible airlines. So not always going to be the cheapest.
2017,4,A very helpful app to understand great deals on flights
2017,3,Would be great to have multi-city search like IOS. Even Kayak and Momondo have it. Why not Skyscanner?
2017,4,"I liked, not bad but they have to work more while other competitors are doing well either"
2017,4,"Easy to use, could give multi airport option, as with website, then it would be perfect!"
2017,4,"easy to use, saves time in getting the best deal."

2017,5,Nic app
2017,5,This app is for me
2017,4,"Love the website, and the app is pretty darn good! However, I fall short on giving 5 stars because one of the BIG reasons it was awesome was the ""search whole month"" feature, which still works fine on the desktop version, but seems to not exist in the app. Please please please fix this issue, as it was one of the main reasons why I downloaded the app, which I used to find even more reliable than the desktop. Now it's the other way round, the desktop is better because of the ""while month"" feature. Otherwise, great app if you know specific dates for travel (which unfortunately is almost never my case)."
2017,5,"I was beyond distracted when trying to book a  simple one way, Krabi to Bangkok. Thai Lion Air kept refusing my payment. Air Asia was overpriced. I looked at a few blogs and one guy mentioned skyscanner. It worked like a charm, and didnt send me to an airline site that charges you for every little thing. It got me Thai Airlines for less than $40 per person flying into BKK, which is great,  so now I can just take the airport rail link right into town and get to my Silom hotel quickly using the MRT and BTS, instead of flying me to the commuter airport DMK which I would have had to take a bus for half an hour just to get to the  MRT, to avoid the cab ride I had last time that cost $30 because the driver took the long way, over one hour,  in midtown after work traffic. I wish that I knew about Skycanner a long time ago, because it gave me the best price for the best airline at the best airport location at a rate one would usually pay for with a low cost airline using a promo! Aloha and mahalo to everyone at Skyscanner, for saving my sanity and getting me a great ticket  when it just couldn't be done."
2017,4,"Great app to go with the website.  Lots of options and flexibility and proce watch is useful too.    My only thing I would love to add if at all possible and I'm sure it isn't easy. On the website you can state you want to use the same airport out and inbound, if you could add that or make the different airport bold that would be great as I've nearly booked one of those pesky flights with differing airports :-)"
2017,3,Excellent so far with easy to search functions. Would be perfect if searches & price alerts can be set up for multi-city flights on the app! Quite inconvenient for people looking for long haul Europe flights since many do open-jaw.
2017,5,It's one of the strongest application for find the flights. They have great choises and options to choose the price . And using kyscanner from the laptop in their website it will give you more option like multiple flights and check the prices rating depand on the the whole month . You can also converte it to bar graph so you can really decide what flight is good for your budget.  Thank you developers for making this easy to us .
2017,5,Before I book any flights I ALWAYS use flight scanner. Most convenient search engine app by far and so comprehensive now with all the added bits. 1st app downloaded on each new device I get - super useful & doesn't eat up my data allowance ;)
2017,4,Love this app! My only suggestion is to allow searches from and to multiple airports at once. For example I live in Columbia Missouri and I would like to be able to see flights departing from Kansas City and St. Louis at the same time.
2017,3,"The detailed flight information has been removed. I found it very useful in terms of what to expect once on board the plane and wish you could reintroduce it. Meal, leg room, wifi, etc."
2017,1,"What a potty app, prices never match with the final payment. Ther is atleast difference of 2k-3k in tickets cost. I wish i could give in minus."
2017,5,"It works very well, and can't be compared with other flight apps on the Playstore. Skyscanner‚úà is quite the best. Edit: still 5*"
2017,1,"I searched for a flight and it said, price ¬£332. I when to book it and changes to ¬£988. Everyone show keep away."
2017,5,"Great app, awesome website if your planning multiple flight trip. Sorting is very intuitive and flexible filtering is fantastic."
2017,5,Soo easy to find cheap flight it will show you what day is the cheapest to buy and if the price go down they will email you. Soo easy i love it
2017,4,The app is awesome.. lots of cheap flight listing.. when compared to other service provider
2017,5,"Saves fortunes. Can't always get the exact prices, but very difficult to get anything cheaper"
2017,4,It would be nice if we can also view the price of the ticket 3 days before and 3 days after the scheduled flight.

2017,1,"Why does this app require me to give it permission to access my CAMERA,, MICROPHONE, CONTACTS, SMS, etc etc? I cannot make it work unless i give this permissions, which for sure should not be needed to make this app work.  So no, i wont even use it and would highly recommend no one to use it"
2019,1,They have changed a really simple and brilliant search engine into something rubbish ! Who would get paid to authorise this ? I want the old version back too. IF YOU SEARCH GOOGLE FOR OLD SKYSCANNER APK .. IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THE PREVIOUS VERSION ( WITH MONTH/ YEAR VIEWS )
2018,1,I used this app/site for the last 10 years... Looks nice but now it is impossible to get the right dates to travel with so many suggestions! I gave up.
2017,5,i have been a traveller for over 17 years and this is one of the best apps ive used for booking air tickets. only problem is no reward points system for constantly using this app again and again to find flights and booking thru them. Otherwise a very useful app and a must have for travellers in their phone.
2017,3,"its ok ..like other apps. if i tipe deutschland it works if i tipe Florida , it dont. like its work in progress. and skyscanner.de i cant oprn. i anabled java ,cleared cash, and everything possible, but it cant open it."
2017,1,"I liked this app. It started sending notifications forcing me to use it when it never did before, with no option to disable it, so now I'm uninstalling it. Maybe I'll come back when/if you put in an option to stop it. Blocking notifications will block the notifications I actually cared about."
2017,4,I really like the app. The only improvement I would recommend is allowing the user to select individual connecting flights based on dates of travel. It's very useful for checking on travel dates!
2017,5,Easy to use. Not confusing. Does what I want so far. Great layout. Hopefully I can get some awesome deals for travelling because of this app. Cheers
2017,4,"I like the app, it's handy and easy to use. I would recommend it.  I would however love it if there also was a Sort & Filter before I'd search for a flight."
2017,1,I am in China and it doesnt work as it should be. I have just paid for my tickets only to be informed a few hours later that there was an overbooking. Obviously the money was gone from my account by then. Be careful with this app.
2017,5,Really simple to use. I booked 6 flights for less than ¬£70 for month of holiday. Was cheapest prices and had great time. Always looking at this app first for flights between places. So much easier x
2017,4,"Nice app for searching, but not great for searching business class or first class tickets. You see the results for economy and don't see the business class fares until clicking through, even with filters in place. Would give it 5* if this was fixed."
2017,2,The online search is better than the App.... The Application search  has no results like the online site..the same flights I searched online has more options than the App... Plus the. Whole month option is not exist in the app.
2017,4,"I really like this application, it's my main tool to plan travels, I gave 4 stars because in explore everywhere it would be nice if you added option from everywhere to particular place"
2017,5,One of my favorite apps... Great apps for flight booking..... I find out best deal with this apps lowest price...simple and easy to use.... love it
2017,5,"I love the price alerts!  I have family and friends scattered across the U.S., and being able to keep an eye on upcoming airfare helps tremendously."
2017,5,Perfect app because you can search for specific dates and destinations or for a wide range or dates and locations to get the best price. Love it!
2017,5,"Great format, easy to use! Love the feature to find the cheapest days and month! Great app"
2017,5,Stranded in New Zealand after missing my flight. Bought a one way ticket to Melbourne cheaper and quicker than Flightcentre!
2017,5,"I use Skyscanner for 99% of my travel, it always finds me the most affordable flights at the right time."
2017,1,"Can't turn off the annoying notification in the app. Only thing to do is turn off all notifications from the app in system settings, which also turns off future notifications that I may want to get."
2017,2,"No multi-city choice, my main criteria. Will check flight from skyscanner online."
2017,1,App on different mobile phones shows totally different results and prices and it is not user-friendly as website :dissapointed:
2017,5,"This app is great , I've used it to find a few of my flights!  It is really helpful in finding the best rate!!"
2017,5,"I love this app because it gives a great starting point for finding what the fares will be at certain times. If you want to fly, but don't have set dates and want to figure out when you can get the best rates, this app is definitely your friends!"
2017,5,"Skyscanner has problems with upgrading results to the latest prices. Not happened first time that in the results shows very much cheap price, however when you click to check it shows higher prices (ex: AZAL and Gotogate official websites)"
2017,5,Great app. Easy to compare prices. Thank you.
2017,5,Skyscanner is your ultimate travel skivvy! You can always rely on the speed and accuracy of this app
2017,5,Great at finding and rating flights across multiple providers. Fast too!

2017,5,"Very simple and easy to use.  Nice layout,  not overcrowded.  Very fast."
2017,5,So easy to find the best flights. Hotels. Recommended for the traveler
2017,1,"Literally doesn't work, tried to type in 'Manchester' into the airports selection and nothing came up"
2017,4,"The most favorite part of the app for me is how you can watch all different types of flights at once, and receive notifications about them"
2017,4,Great app quite like the price alert comes in handy saved my self a few ¬£¬£¬£ if your flexible with dates also
2017,5,Truly outstanding application...!!! Covers all travels aspects fantastically...!!!

2017,5,Thank You developers
2017,5,Greatt...
2017,5,Thanks
2017,5,Wow
2017,5,Works
2017,5,Iloveit
2017,5,Grrst
2017,5,Ok
2017,5,A lot of options
2017,5,‡¨≠‡¨≤ ‡¨≤‡¨æ‡¨ó‡¨ø‡¨≤‡¨æ
2017,5,Class app
2018,1,"Aftrr I bought a few tickets with this application, it started to provide 
me innacurate and even misleading information, like changing the price in 
the midfle of the process, and even worse, it kept the price but changed 
the currency without proper notification, making the tickets twice more 
expensive than expected. I felt cheated!! I will never use it again. Be 
careful with it!"
2017,5,"Just the best there is, period. Give it a try and you'll see. It tracks the and send you a notification right away. Love the graph feature. If you can travel anytime in the year, you can plan ahead by looking at the best prices over the year to do so. (Thanks for the quick reply to the developer team.)"
2017,4,"Sometimes it's a bit clunky to use, especially when i don't want flights early in the morning. But overall one of the best travelcompanigon apps out there.  Take me anywhere feature is my all time favorite"
2017,2,"Overall ok but I get the feeling that periodically they try to push some airline over others.  thanks for the reply,  it would be great if you answered so exhaustively to anyone and not just to defend yourself. I still get the feeling, but hey, it's not an accusation."
2017,1,I fed up with this app i cant contact them or send them any email complaining GOTOGATE  travel. Dont book with them thay took my money without giving any confirmation.  I dont know how can i get my money back. The bank said they paid to them and they said thst didnt charge me. Who should I believe?
2017,1,"You make a search, it shows the expected price, then you confirm the date, it doubles the previous price. You think, OK, prices changes, them you search again one hour later, one day later and it keeps showing the lower price as before and you keep getting the higher price when you confirm. I can't trust in the app like this =/"
2017,3,"Please include the option ""Number of days"" in that way i can choose the cheapest and best deals to take based of that interval. Lets say a company gave me 13 days then the application will show me the best and cheapest rates flight to take each month of the year for those 13 days , and also will show what day of the week will be the last day of my vaccation based on the number I entered."
2017,1,The website is great however the app is terrible. Tries to be too clever. Just show me a bar chart with the day's of the month like the website so it's easy to see the cheapest day's to travel.
2017,2,I want to plan multi stop overs and couldn't work out how to do it! It's pretty though. Just too one dimensional for me ‚úåÔ∏è
2017,5,"Just the app i'm looking for! An excellent app to monitor airline ticket prices(including budget airline). Also, hotel and car rental price tracking is available at my fingertips!"
2017,4,It's GOOD. I have not yet bought my ticket though. I will up date this comment later. I love how it show all available airlines so it does give you more options than Hopper.
2017,5,Really the best app I have ever used. It gives you the options to see prices for the whole month instead of checking a day by day. Never rate an app but this one deserves it
2017,5,Brilliant app... I booked all my recent flights using this app. It just makes finding cheap flights sooo easy. Good job guys.
2017,4,I love this app! great features and easy to use. Could add a few things that only the website has.
2017,1,"It rarely works, and when it does  it shows you the most expensive flights, my mum and I both searched at the same time and each one of us got a different price!"
2017,5,Very useful app for comparing and purchasing the flight ticket. Useful alsonfor combining your airlines for several place. Most of the time I used Skyscanner.   Thanks Skyscanner!
2017,1,Bloody rubbish. No easy way to see only direct flights and doesn't even show flights from the correct airport
2017,2,"There is an issue with this application , sometimes when the prices go down it doesnt notify the user about it , i need every time to check the prices manually."
2017,4,Great app but a number of functions are still not available in the mobile app. Example: Option for multi-city flights
2017,2,I wanted an app to check how my wifes flight was going and all I got was something that wanted to sell me flights.  Absolutely useless.
2017,4,Fast. User friendly. Saves a lot of time. Price alerts are really useful.
2017,4,Very good app. Cant plan a trip without it. Love the widget!
2017,2,Works fine but does it really need this many notifications? How often do you think people fly..?
2017,1,Push Notifications to read articles and suggestions to book flights without a way to turn them off? No thank you.
2017,5,Love it. Easy to use and lots of options to find the best deal. Is now definitely my go to app for looking for flights.
2017,5,"The absolute best travel app that exists, the price alerts are the most amazing feature along with the way in which you can see the price per month in graph format"
2017,5,Love this! Alerts for price changes! Finally a useful app to find plane tickets.
2017,5,"Best app for traveling. Needs some user rewards program, like mileage included or something based on money spent on the app."
2017,2,New confusing UI: -1. Windows are gone: -1. Does not work as good as the previous version: -1.
2017,5,Very useful! Hope they add more travel agent to get more variety of prices.
2017,5,Let's you know when prices stop for flights. Saving money is always a win!
2017,1,Well it seems Malaga doesn't exist and any other airport i put in! Think you may have a glitch in your system!
2017,5,Love the cleanliness and easier navigation. It would be nice if you put a brief description on every country
2017,4,It's really unfortunate that the app cannot do multi-city. But happy to hear they're working on it. ;)
2017,5,"The best. Simple, effective interface. Plenty of results."
2017,5,Easy to use with helpful tips to set proper expectations per flight. Satisfied.
2017,3,Settings reset after every update. The search options are very limited compared to the desktop site.
2017,5,Perfect app to book cheap flight tickets. Serving more than my expectations.
2017,4,Pretty good.  Useful but missed some of the deals.
2017,5,I love this app. Help me watch flight price!
2017,2,Didn't find the multi-city route plan feature as seen on the website
2017,5,"Great, slick interface and operation. And excellent breadth of search"
2017,5,Very good site covers all diff choices of flights and hotels
2017,5,"Love it, the feature that shows the  price difference on nearby days is excellent!"
2017,5,I book all my trips through this. From flights to car rentals to hotels
2017,3,Absolutely fine but seems to be missing the option to search for flights to all destinations from a particular airport
2017,4,I liked about this app is they are giving offers on  family and relly love by the cost of ticket it is nt much expensive great app
2017,4,"it gives you an idea however lots of fraud from agents , either by hidden charges or by wrong currency then fake exchange rste"
2017,4,Great prices! and easy to use it!
2017,5,Swift deals. V good app
2017,1,Limited routes and not showing the right price for domestic flights
2017,5,Easy to use and really useful. Thanks

2017,5,best prices. excellent UI
2017,5,Very easy to use. I only wish that you could search a range of dates to determine the cheapest day
2017,5,This application is really superb and very useful. I recommended to my family and friends.

2017,3,For Android OS system still needs refinement. From my own experience entering adults non-stop flights product automatically lists anywhere between 90 - 121 flights. Squeezed in between all those listings you have to search them out yourself while scanning through all the ads. I'm going to try another application / product on Google playstore.
2017,3,"Love this app with the exception of it needs to have more filters when searching for flights. Ex. I am searching for a flights to go to nyc and do not want to travel Spirit Airlines but each time I put a date I have to go back in to remove Spirit and it gets a bit tedious. Also I would rather the flight alerts only alert me when the price goes down, why do I need to know that the price went up when that is usually expected?"
2017,4,"I must admit, I don't use this app for booking, I once used an agent through the site I had never heard of before, no ticket was issued(no money was taken) but my card number was used a couple of days later for a purchase on the other side of the world. However, this site is excellent at finding airlines and connections that wouldn't  have otherwise occured to me. I use it most times before I make a flight booking to scan the market."
2017,2,"No facility to book multi-city flights on the app. Kayak offers multi-city booking facility. Unless out is included on this app, I will be forced to use the Kayak app.  Please let us know if you plan to have the multi-city booking facility on this app.  Thanks"
2017,5,I'm 100% loving this app. Best flight booking ever. I been traveling for 10 years and believe me this si the cheapest most outstanding site ever. Take my words for it
2017,4,This apps is so helpful. I don't have to check all the web to compare the price. Comparing price and time is now super easy. I love it so much
2017,4,Skyscanner is the best flight search app... Sometimes it shows flights which are no longer available... But I suppose that is not the worst thing in the world
2017,4,"Close to giving this 5 stars, just waiting to use more of the features. So far I love using it to find cheap flights and the app is easier than the website which is also great."
2017,4,The alerts were only on email however it will be great to have a sms alert everything price falls. Also  the alerts if it can be set on 2 to 3 specific time flights it will be just awesome.
2017,5,Simply what I need. Searching for the best suitable flight. Easy arrangements. Something to work on is to be able just to delete some of the historie instead of the whole history at once.
2017,2,"Decent app, good service and easy to use. But can't turn off unwanted notifications from within the app and that's unforgivable"
2017,5,"Cool app, could you please add possibly of choosing stop in certain airport, for example i want to travel from London to Phuket, and it's 1-2 stop trip, and I want to find one with stop in Moscow for example, would be much appreciated"
2017,5,A fabulous platform to see n book flight prices at a very very competitive price. At times few websites showing lesser prices either don't open or gets sold out.
2017,5,"The app was very useful, as it was simple to book, and compare through diferrent websites. It gave a lot of info about the flight, seat, meals, airline, duration and aircraft type."
2017,5,I've always found the lowest priced flights on this app comparing it to a few others I use along with it. So I stick to this one it's great and easy to navigate
2017,3,"Cannot use the app to search flights for multi-cities, like the feature on the website. Hope it gets upgraded"
2017,5,Great app. I have been using this app for booking flights every time. Very helpful and provides detailed information.
2017,3,In Android phone application.. Ther no multiple city option... Datz make dis a bit low on rating
2017,4,"So far its the best of its kind and needs more airlines. I did like the transparency verses apps that leave you no way to easily compare so I end up going direct to the airline to see the savings, if any, before I buy."
2017,5,Found the prices to be the lowest I've seen anywhere .  Haven't tried to book a flight through this app so can't say about the follow through use of  I hope it is true to the prices shown a good thumbs up
2017,2,Needs multi-city airfare tracker. Without this feature it's no better than other apps.
2017,5,"I love this app. It's quick, easy to use and clear. I only use this app to look for flights"
2017,5,Very Great 'n' it gives so many options for good trip deals...‚ù§‚ù§ü§ôüí™üá∫üá∏üá±üá∑.. Love it...
2017,1,"does not find cheapest flights that actually do exist. E.g Eindhoven-Kaunas, 17 of August with Wizzair."
2017,5,Pretty effective and it has the option to get notifications if prices drop. (No Emails)
2017,5,Right to the point. Needed to see where to get cheap tickets and found them here. Great job with the app. Will use it exclusively from now in.
2017,4,"Easy to use. Very good comparisons. Filters helpful, but could be more robust."
2017,5,I ALWAYS search my flights from there and I travel quiet a lot. No hidden costs
2018,4,"Simple but effective. Liked how it accurately described the pros and cons 
of flights I was considering."
2017,5,It sums up anything you need for a travel in just an app. It's awesome!
2017,5,Its easy to navigate. It is very easy to compare prices. Great app.
2017,5,Easy to compare prices for flight and hotel. Still exploring the other features
2017,5,Cool but... Does it have in-app deals? Gotta know
2017,5,It is fast an easy to find the better deal for your flights. Love the app
2017,1,Jacked up prices? This app shows twice as much than the actual fares.
2017,1,craps. the payment shown in USD instead of local currency which is much more expensive than buy ticket directly from airlines. never buy ticket here.
2017,5,Useful app. Request that direct flight option is available when making request in home page only
2017,5,"Very good, hope can promote more resort and recommend trip or resort, thank you"
2017,5,Perfect app! It helps you find the best prices in the market!
2017,2,Charged me more than the amount showed in the app and didn't get my e-ticket for long time...
2017,5,This app allows the user to easily search flights around the world.
2017,1,After one hour making a decision the stupid app tells you that the price MAYBE is not so correct
2017,3,Great interface but It would be much better if multi-city search was available.
2017,5,It makes looking at flights much easier especially with prices
2017,5,Love this app so much its so quick and easy to use I have had no problems whatsoever and I find lots of bargains WIN
2017,4,At times shown fare not available but still the best fare finder...
2017,5,"It is,easy give u different prices and the dates,from high season to low."
2017,4,Gives a range of different flight choices with the option to filter.
2017,5,Best app I've come across. Love it!

2017,5,My go to app for flights
2017,5,This app is my go to for all my travels
2017,5,Does what I want.
2017,5,It's worth
2017,5,Perfekt
2017,5,Like it
2017,5,Epic app
2017,5,It helps much
2017,5,Works for me
2017,5,Super  app
2017,5,Hop dop
2017,1,"You've dropped the ball. Your previous app allowed you to easily search for flights to ""anywhere"" from a chosen airport. I can't find hire to do this. This was your USP for me. Another feature of slowing me to be flexible with dates was equally important. All the searches I did said ""no flights available"" (or something similar) with no option to be flexible with dates. Where once you were my only flights search engine, now you are just one of many below-average apps."
2017,1,"I don't usually write reviews but did this just to protect other people. The app gives stunning rates for your tickets. When you try to book it takes you to other booking sites which are dodgy as hell. Three examples: mytrip, globehunters, airtickets. Do some research on Google. These companies are dodgy as hell. Duped many customers. Uninstalling with a one star review. Total scam."
2017,4,"A very good app. I like the green dots on dates where prices are cheap as it helps to avoid selecting dates in which travel is expensive. Search results are displayed in seconds. It also contains information about the flight like aircraft type, seating position, leg space, type of meal (free or paid), etc."
2017,3,Continuous problems when redirected to booking site.  The price/calendar function would be good if it made s nse.  Often 5he yellow dots indicate 0$ to 0$ and the green pretty much anything else.  Ho useful is that?  Not very!  Smarten up and stop trying to hide the better priced fares!
2017,3,"The app works fine. I faced one small issue. I am in India and since the app had my location information,  I was expecting to see prices in our currency I. E. Indian Rupee, but everything is in euros. Hope to have that fix. Thanks."
2017,4,"Hi, so far I am enjoying your app but please could you help me with one thing; how can I add more airline options? I can only see two on my tab. Please send here the details. Thank you."
2017,4,I only used it one time but there is a great filter feature that shows in a bar graph what times are the most expensive. It really helps make the decision to pay a $30 difference vs. A $300 difference by a few hours.
2017,4,"Very helpful app, missing some of the functionality of the web page though. Advanced filtering generally missing. Multicity flights give weird/illogical options."
2017,4,"This is my first time to use this app. I have yet to discover its perks but so far, I'm enjoying this app. I hope this helps me in my future travels."
2017,5,"This is one of my go to app to check for flights.. Been using it for over a year now and love it! Even if the prices changes by a dollar, I'll get a notification.... I'm addicted to it..."
2017,4,Havent found a website that has the same rate as Skyscanner shows. Will keepp trying. It is still very good to get all the info on my potential destinations.
2017,3,"Prima era da 5 stelle, ridateci la versione 2013 !! Questa √® meno pratica ed immediata anche se poi a, volerci perdere del tempo, si riescono a ritrovare (dove hanno spostato) le funzioni piu utili.  Before it was 5 stars, give back the 2013 release !!"
2017,5,"This is probably one of the best travel app out there, i love when you can search a flight, book a room, and rent a car in the same app ! Bravo skyscanner ! Still waiting for your next cool updates !"
2017,5,"I always find the best deals on this app, it's perfect for booking last minute flights amd even when planning ahead, would highly recommend!"
2017,5,Very good and easy app. But still need a little imrpovement. To search flight not for a specific date only
2017,4,This app is very helpful and cost of flights are up to date. Easy to use when I'm looking to compare air fares.
2017,5,It's the only app I use when I need to book a flight. Saves money and doesn't have ads or annoying notifications.
2017,5,"Great app, very useful. Can easily compare price and itinerary with multiple airlines in one go."
2017,4,Trusted site and app for several years but the main problem with the app is that you can't use the multi destination function which is a pain. Come on Skyscanner get your act together !
2017,5,Great way to find awesome deals and discover new places if you are open to it. That travel everywhere option is the key to discovery.
2017,5,It is very helpful for the Travellers that dont have time to so search for cheap flights... I love it üíó
2017,5,Always start all my flying travel plans with this app. Compare prices throughout the weeks and months to see when is the cheapest time to fly is.
2017,5,Useful app. Give me a lot of information about good price of ticket
2017,5,My go to place when I need a flight. I've been using it for awhile and I love it!
2017,5,Saved $1000 on a last minute emergency trip... Great app!
2017,5,"Excellent app for checking fares across wide range, of flight or hotel.."

2017,5,Great comparison site for travel planning. My first stop!
2017,4,Good for getting flights and comparing prices from different providers

2017,4,I like the way it works and the accuracy of the information it provides
2017,4,Very handy to have both flights and hotels
2017,1,Only finds expensive flights... Useless app
2017,5,"Great for finding cheap flights, but you have to be flexible on the day you fly out and back. Mostly red-eye flights."
2017,5,I use it for the flights only and it really has the cheapest flights. I really recommend it
2017,2,Quando filtra por gr√°fico apresenta um valor ao filtrar √© mostrado outro.
2017,1,If you send me one more unsolicited notification I swear to god......
2017,5,Super useful for finding the best prices and routes!
2017,5,I like this app but I am confused ..... I check one day great value .... so I have a chat with my wife .... decide to book ... prices gone up .... now I know the airlines are a little like that but I just feel ......
2017,4,"Great app, I use it all the time to book my flights to the States."

2017,4,Good app for me to search for cheapest price around
2017,5,"So far so good. Easy to use, and not buggy."
2017,1,The prices showing are changing when we try to issue the ticket.
2017,5,Really good app.save me a lot of time searching for flights and give me so many options..love it !!!
2017,5,"This app is great, I found great deals every time I  needed to purchase tickets!"
2017,5,"Very fast, easy to use and good alternative to low price and promotion."
2017,5,"Layover info good, maybe highlight overall time between off boarding and on boarding"
2017,5,This is pretty amazing app to check the lowest airline fares and also gives you the estimate for upcoming months.
2017,5,Been using Skyscanner on the web for more than 10 years and the app just got even more features
2017,5,User friendly and it saves me a lot of time going to any other airline websites
2017,5,Its just amazing to get your air support just a far from few touch on mobile screen*

2017,5,"I haven't booked a flight yet, but have gone through the process uo until confirmation, varying number of passengers and destinations. This app is AMAZING! Especially if you let IT set up your plans, and you're open to traveling anywhere.   This coupled with couchsurfing sets you up for super cheap travel, anywhere in the world"
2017,1,"Searching a flight to everywhere, hey I found one just 30 EUR! Oh no wait it's actually 96 EUR. Well ok, it happens. Searching 30 min later, price is again 30 EUR in the ""everywhere"" page. Seriously? Why doesn't it just update to 96? You must be kidding me."
2017,5,"I find skyscanner so easy to use, since moving to asia 2 years ago ive never used anything else to book my flight. Its fast, convienent and money saving. Cant live without it."
2017,4,The best app out there for air travel needs... The only thing missing from the app is options for MULTI CITY departure and arrival. Plz fix it in the next update
2017,1,Just doesn't work anymore...uninstalled. sad after using for more than 5 years... I am unhappy with this new UI. Its not working
2017,5,"Really like using the app for price comparison and flight deals you wouldn't find anywhere else. Love the feature which shows when it's cheap to travel as well, makes planning trips ahead of time much easier."
2017,5,Very nice app that helps keeping track of the destination you would like/need to flight to. I ike the notification system that summarises if prices went up or down during the last day.
2017,5,I gave this a 5 star rating before and now it just looks good but lacks the search features before.  Some of the airlines are not showing in any search. It just gives the flights that I guess are not really the cheapest as stated.
2017,4,So far the app has been helpful. Haven't actually used it yet though but at least I got ides for how much the flight would be.
2017,1,It wasn't helpful. The app waited for prices to go up before it suggested I make a purchase. Would give it a zero if I could.
2017,5,"Found out while in Amsterdam that it would have been cheaper to fly from Stansted to south of France than buy the cannabis brownie that didn't even contain proper cannabis that makes you high. Tasted disgusting btw, don't try it. Anyway good app"
2017,5,"I love this app, so useful and much better than the desktop version. It is easy to track price changes for specific potential holiday destinations and also to browse for the cheapest short term options."
2017,2,"Quotes cheapest prices for countries, then when you select it, they're not available or far more expensive. Frustrating."
2017,4,"I have used a few of this type app and this one has been the best. Easy to navigate, compare and book flights."
2017,5,Easy to use. Notifies whenever there's a price change for the flight I've searched and it actually finds cheap flights for all airlines.
2017,4,"The app is pretty good but doesn't include special deal and flight neww, such as south west airline"
2017,4,Good apps for flying cost reference. In some cases the suggested results weren't the best price or really practical
2017,5,"My go to app for all things airfares and travel, my fav thing to use to spot best deals. Love it!!"
2017,4,I liked the old interface better it was easier to navigate but this is an overall good app. I use it to find the cheapest flights.
2017,4,"My main flight finder... A few less good things, but overall great."
2017,5,I think it is lovely. The suggestion and recommendations are top notch. Very unique features
2017,1,please give an option of choosing a hole month and not a specific date to see the prices.   It would be nice if I can see all the prices shown of each day of the month
2017,5,One problem. Multi city works on the Internet. Doesn't work on app. Need to book multi city.
2017,3,Very nice website and app for booking flights and hotels.  Interface is really very interactive and full of suggestions.
2017,5,Awesome app make flight booking so much easy n effective. Love it.
2017,5,"Very easy to use, provisionally arranged my flight effortlessly.  Rob - Bournemouth"
2017,5,Very handy helpful and easy-to-use app found the best deals through this. üëç
2017,5,"They suggest routes what, even the travel agents are not able to... Super"
2017,5,Using since last 2 years. Awesome. Saved a lot of money. Recommended a lot of colleagues. Happy!
2017,5,Good application. Very useful especially for me to check and book my flight
2017,4,Wish it would give more info price drop trends throughout the year.
2017,2,Will not allow me to sign in. I keep getting kicked out. Needs to be fixed
2017,5,Brilliantly designed and super useful. Why look for flights anywhere else?
2017,4,"This app is so friendly, I can check out and gain access to my favorite flight info in just a second."
2017,5,Best app to search and track flight/hotel pricing.
2017,5,Good Design and interface.  Helps to search desired flights
2017,5,Good app for exploring options and choices for travel destinations by dates and price.
2017,5,This is awesome app. Very helpful.  Thanks.
2017,4,It's OK but not showing all options available. Still good overall
2017,4,New and updated had the ozld version this new one is good found options I couldn't get on expedia and cheaper too
2017,5,Perfect prices and great deals with multiple choices and easy to use
2017,3,I actually got better deals on airline websites than the best deals shown (probably the best deals are sponsored)
2017,5,I always find good prices. It is easy to use.
2017,5,Always gives best fare and best tool to plan your trips
2017,5,Very good application to check flight ticket price
2017,4,"The best app, I did find my plane ticket in less then 2 minüòä"
2017,5,Best airfare search app ever. Does need some work but it is still the best.
2017,5,"You can see the calendar and compare cheapest days to fly, and then if you book through the app there is no fee!"
2017,5,Easy to use and find the cheapest day with the green dots. Two thumbs up.
2017,5,Great app. And it's a great help with flights
2017,3,It will be better to be able to select multi destination as per website.
2017,4,"Great app, but I your website on my computer is more user friendly"
2017,5,Best app!..found really cheap airfares. Please enable multi city search for US.
2017,4,"Good application, easy and fast search for results."
2017,4,Fast and better prices found than the other search engines

2017,5,I like sky scanner app the green yellow red on the sc is the best thing
2017,5,I love tha last minute trip suggestions  And the notifications that I receive about my organised trips during the year .
2017,5,It is handy which I could say Sky scanner could be one of my favourite apps since 2015.
2017,3,The app should have multicity options which is a must as per today's scenario.
2017,4,Limited flight finder.  In some cases it said there were no flights from Heathrow to Sydney.
2017,5,Useful whenever you just think about traveling !! Price overview

2017,3,"I haven't used this app in a few months but I guess it's changed. It used to be an awesome app. You could swipe left to search a bar graph of flight prices to find the cheapest day or time to fly. Visually it was awesome and quick. Am I missing this now? It's not here and I really wish it was brought back. If the function is still here, is really hard to find. I don't have time to look for it so finding a different app I suppose. Please bring back this functionality!   Update, recieved a response saying that there is a chart feature in to right corner but there's not. Is there a way I can send a screenshot? Can someone email me so I can show them what I'm clearly not seeing?"
2017,1,"Used to allow a search from a given airport for a given month to a destination of everywhere and present a simple list of destinations and prices.  Now you have to do the search for a specific date, then once the search results are displayed you can edit the date to an entire month with some fiddling. But then it just displays some random dates rather than a chart/calendar of all dates. Not any better than the other flight finders, Kayak Momondo, etc. Not intuitive and difficult to navigate. Worst of all it doesn't even find the cheapest flights on many searches."
2017,3,This app is much too rigid for a multi destination traveller. Should at least mirror the website. No combo flight+hotel+car. Not useful enough for cost planning. There are better apps.
2017,5,This is very nice app. But I have seen that there is no multi-city search in app whereas on website it is available. Dear admin kindly include multi-city search in next update. Thank you very much for making our life easier than before. Thumbs up...üëçüëçüëç
2017,5,I only use this site too look for flights but it is easily the most effective and efficient way to do so. With the different flight search layouts it's easy to see lower/higher prices.
2017,3,"Please allow multiple destinations from the app for Android users, my friend's iPhone has thus feature yet the most updated Android version only allows single or return?"
2017,1,"No longer king of cheap flights, at least in Asia. Google and kayak are cheaper, with the latter offering many more flights. Momondo for Europe too"
2017,5,"Skyscanner has helped me find the best air fares for my trips, national and international. I don't even go to other sites anymore."
2017,2,Used to be my default app for flights now it cannot even find flights which I know exist as other apps find them. Time to move to another app
2017,5,I love being able to check flight prices on the go.  The color coded dots make it  even quicker to find what fits my budget.
2017,5,Only just installed app but love the layout. Will be booking a trip to japan so will keep you posted!
2017,5,Good app that makes booking hotels and flights very easy. Seems problem free and straight forward to use.
2017,1,Hate the BS ads/sites it sends you to. Installing means SPAM folks. AVOID and use another app.
2017,5,"If you are a traveller, this is a must app.  Thanks developers. Great job!"
2017,5,Great app. Get the best deals for when I fly to Spain for both Flights and car hire.
2017,5,Fantastic app!! All the best prices and options. Never fails!
2017,5,The best travel search app I've ever used. Well designed and easy to use.
2017,5,Where was this app when I booked so many airtickets from other sites paying so costly for each tickets. I could have saved much money. This app is surely good and saved lot of money.

2017,4,Great app to organise trips! All in one place!

2017,5,Thanks Skyscenner
2017,5,üëçüëçüëç
2017,5,Brilliant
2017,2,I used to love this app. Now suddenly it is covered in annoying photos and options that I don't want and it doesn't give comprehensive search information anymore. It's like trying to flick through a glossy magazine full of pictures when all you want is a list of cities and prices. It's using way more data than it ever used to and the constant travel suggestions and alerts are bugging me. Please bring the old app back it was wonderful and practical for frequent business travellers.
2017,3,"App is very good, the search bot works very fine. But there is one issue, it never shows me the home screen notification for the flights I put a watch or notification ON. I always have to check the price change just by opening app/website chronically. What is it useful then? Plz solve the bug. Rest is awesome :)"
2017,2,I used to use this app to plan my holidays and check direct flights going from my airport to other countries. I have not been able to do the same on the new version. I could not find the same options as before. I have not got the results and answers that I would have got with the old version. Please bring the old version back. The new one is not useful
2017,2,"Prices not even close to being the same once you click on them. I don't care what destination, what time period, roundtrip, one way. It'll show one price for the search, you click it, it jumps way up and you'll never see the price it originally showed. What k√≠nda bs is that? Edit: Screenshots sent as per your request."
2017,4,"I love that I can pick a location to fly from & it will tell me all the places I can fly from starting at the cheapest. As a traveler who likes to go anywhere, this feature allows me to travel more frequently to places I might not originally think to go. Great for planning weekend trips."
2017,5,"This is by far the BEST flight booking app I've ever seen. Offers tons of mix and match options with your available dates and even If you're not sure About dates and just looking for any cheapest destination in USA or Canada or anywhere for weekends or even for particular month, you can get the cheapest price for that destination. Also they give you the cheapest prices for next few weeks upto next three months so you can get an idea. Also these prices are 99% accurate."
2017,5,"Excellent tool for finding flights easy to understand and as a traveller I always use Skyscanner to plan my next flight.  Now the bad! Always clear your cookies if you return to Skyscanner for the same ticket.  Skyscanner uses cookies to track your browsing, you will notice that the more you use the app the price goes up!   This is to encourage you to purchase the ticket based on fear of loss!  So my advice is always clear your cookies before using/returning to  the app as it will go up in price."
2017,5,The BEST app to search for flights since they include low-cost airlines and mix airline companies to get the best deal. I actually got to get a transcontinental flight for less‚Äã than half the price compared to the own airline's‚Äã webpage price. Best travel app ever.
2017,5,I never trusted these kind of applications before because they have higher prices than airline website.  But with the Skyscanner app things are different. It saved my time and money. Prices were cheap and reasonable.  Thank you Skyscanner.
2017,5,Flawless  (almost ). The odd company is not shown. But brilliant to get a feel for the price and very intuitive to use. Can opt to show prices in different countries and currencies.
2017,3,the prices are almost always a lie - when you go to book suddenly your ticket price is higher. This problem doesn't happen with Google flights.
2017,5,Love the idea of the app. Not perfect because sometimes the price it shows you doesn't end up being accurate but it still serves its overall purpose
2017,4,Good go to ap to monitor flights you plan to get. Haven't really trie booking but. We'll see.
2017,4,So far easy to use and does find good deals on flights. Wishlist: wish I could easily link results to Evernote.
2017,5,"Excelente aplicaci√≥n, perfecta para la b√∫squeda de buenas ofertas. Es importante que tanto la app como en la web tengan las mismas features. Gracias"
2017,5,Very helpful for planning flights.  Helps if you're willing to adjust dates for a cheaper flight. Also efficient if you need to arrive or dspart at a specific time (for connecting flights)
2017,5,"Big fan of Skyscanner mobile and desktop versions. Mobile app is easy to use, plus the sort/filter function makes it really effective."
2017,5,"Thanks to Skyscanner, I have been able to travel to places I thought I couldn't! Cheap airlines are worth the travel experience."
2017,1,"While a flight between Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Orlando ,US, costs 2000 usd the skyscanner showed me only one option of 13322 usd for that route."
2017,4,"Perfect app for searching flights, i think it would be even nicer if it includes special deals and last minute travel prices"
2017,5,Was able to find some reasonable flight prices in the middle of summer break so we could travel to UK to visit family! Awesome deals!
2017,5,Skyscanner is the best app and flight search engine ever. I love it as I love booking. Com.
2017,4,Useful for finding cheap flights. Especially love the graph which shows prices across a broad time period.
2017,5,"The only flight app I will use, it's never let me down & consistently finds great prices"
2017,4,Fantastic app. Only improvement would be to include full range of filters and search options that are on Web version
2017,4,Useful for flights and good for if your searching for the best dates and prices for you but there are others.
2017,5,A gem for finding great deals on flights on sites you would never find from a simple google search.
2017,3,How can I use multi flight schedule? App has only two options which is one for return and one for one way.
2017,5,"Really good app. I recommend this to all who are planing their vacation, trip...etc."
2017,4,Great for checking prices. Nice addition of flight info such as aircraft type
2017,4,Great work. Keep on improving. Ur guys doing well so far. Cheers
2017,5,Shows a lot of prices for tickets that are sold out /prices changed. Vayama is the worst with showing incorrect pricing.
2017,4,Usually find the best deals here. Surprisingly happy
2017,5,Great App! Found the cheapest flight! :)
2017,4,Quite easy to search the best price flights.
2017,4,Need to be able to search for the hole month like the website. Other than that everything else seems as good.
2017,1,App thinks I want to fly out of London and I can't see a way to change it to belfast
2017,4,Good app to find your flight and hotel
2017,5,The best service for collating flight and hotel options.
2017,4,"Not used it properly yet , just looked, time will tell when I actually book a flight if it lives up to the hype"
2017,4,I just started using it because I heard a lot about it and in fact I found a cheaper flight then websites I used to use.
2017,5,It's  nice one.... Easy to check the tikt fare. V can book also...!
2017,2,Don't like the unwanted alerts. No way to turn off
2017,3,Good but keeps losing my recent searches and price alerts
2017,4,I like the monthly deals makes a weekend getaway more likely.

2017,5,I'm in love it tells you the cheapest dats go fly before even typing when you want to go
2017,5,"Great app, useful and easy to use, saves money, and present variety of options"
2017,5,"The prices are the best, Kayak and booking not even compare . Awesome."

2017,5,Great app
2017,5,Nice  app

2017,2,"Two stars FOR THE APP only.  Skyscanner on a browser is fantastic and I absolutely love it, clear concise listings, great design, great search filters, great choices for results output, outstandingly useful TOP FIVE WEBSITE.  Then they let a toddler design the app, I wanty big pikuchures an punchy buttons wahhh, resulting (on a wide search) in stupid blocky pop results text cat-scratched onto pointless pictures that lack any information and blur the words you want to read, chronicly ill thought out formatting.  I have no idea at all why this crayon collage got past QC.  There is a reason roads are not an arrangement of randomly shaped and sized multicoloured frilly blocks with lamp posts made of jelly - adults like to see where they are going quickly and efficiently with all options re. traffic and alternative routes clearly marked.  If you really want pointless frills and pretties put em round the edge!  Out of the way of the information, where embellishments belong. I repeat, I love skyscanner, but blimey, sorry about the rant."
2017,1,"I use the website for ages, and tried the app several times. Now I gave it one more chance again, but again it fails on me. I want to search department in one month and return in another. After finally finding this option I chose one month, but after selecting the second month it makes it all the second month! So both flights in the same month, wich I'm not looking for! I tried 3 times and gave up AGAIN. It left me frustrated, because my life got so much better around 8 years ago, when I discovered the website with the option to choose months."
2017,1,Love the website but the app sucks and I always end up reverting to the browser. Its particularly annoying that there is no option to select the whole month for your search like you can on the website... a pretty important feature for people looking for the best deal.
2017,4,"Super good app, but I just don't find the same function of the website to find flights to anywhere in a specific date. Looks like it really need to have a city. But sometimes I just want to know which flights are cheaper in a date that I'm going to be free to travel"
2017,1,"Prices were better than that when i looked on imatrix and southwest. They say no booking fees, but thats total bs. Just book with Southwest, they're awesome!"
2017,5,"I use this app all the time due to the fact that I am a frequent traveller. I use every time I need to book a flight, hotel, or rent a car. I absolutely recommend this app for frequent travellers or people looking to get a good deal."
2017,5,This app has saved me (literally) hundreds. Love the price alerts so I can snatch the tickets at their cheapest while observing different dates for comparison. Best of the lot!
2017,4,Very quick and easy to use. Love the calender with bars highlighting the cheapest days to fly. Use this for all my long haul trips
2017,5,"I don't often rate apps, this app totally deserves my rating. It is just straight forward and easy to use. Does what it's supposed to do better than any other app."
2017,5,LOVE THIS APP! Very helpful for booking flights and hotels. Very simple and easy to use :)
2017,4,"Muchas veces ofrece buenos precios, pero al redirigir a la agencia que los vende ya no est√° disponible el precio. Como sugerencia deben actualizar constantemente la App y vincular precios, muchas veces es decepcionante ver que pudiste haber comprado un vuelo m√°s barato. Como siempre, aqu√≠ encuentras buenos precios."
2017,5,Great app. Very useful! Mostly use for the calender view of flight prices.
2017,4,"Used only to check flight tickets. Haven't tried to book, since I haven't found what I'm looking for."
2017,2,"I downloaded the app to finally find a travel app with a  fly ""anywhere"" option. Did you get rid of it?!"
2017,5,Great improvements. Best app for searching flights so far... Good job.
2017,5,Been using this app for a long time and find it very helpful to get the best route and comparison of price and flight time.
2017,2,"Used to be good app, but now when you go to book flight the providers website says that fare is unavailable and offers a more expensive fare for the same flight."
2017,1,Didn't work on my phone. Keeps crashing. One Plus X
2017,4,"I have used this app  and its great for saving time and money, PS. Recommended to me by tour guide that's a family member!"
2017,5,Alles wat je nodig hebt... Wel even uitzoeken hoe het werkt.. maar als je het eenmaal door hebt.. top!
2017,5,Great app. Good searching ‚Äãengine. Always best offers on the top. Very intuitive app and website
2017,5,Super app. Have yet to get a better flight deal from anywhere else
2017,5,Offers the cheapest flight and hotel options all over the world! Simply brilliant!
2017,3,You have to add whole month option still need development i have installed the app but still using mobile web interface so no need for an app.
2017,3,"I'm very disappointed, don't understand why there's no multicity in the app! Could you please add it!"
2017,1,Utterly useless. Apparently there are no flights from London to Majorca in June of this year.
2017,5,My favourite app for seeking flights and tickets. Fast and easy to use.
2017,5,Used during solo travel during 2013.  Will no doubt be utilised again in the future
2017,5,Awesome app. Just keeping on getting better. Only issue is multi city option could be added.
2017,2,Used to be the best. Now full of errors and missing proper prices.
2017,5,I just love it! It helps me to compare the cheapest flight ticket üòâ

2017,4,Got a price alert for a flight i want but when i tried to book it the price was not reduced.

2017,4,Its one of the very good apps in finding cheap flights..
2017,5,It's really helpful app and easy to use the only problem is why log in with  email it should be straight forward still it's very good app.
2017,5,Used it... Got a great deal!!
2017,4,"The app is great for comparing prices, and knowing who is offering what and then take a decision."
2017,2,App sucks.  Not user friendly.
2017,5,I use it all the time. And the new releases added some really good functionalities.
2017,5,Really functional. You can look at different options quite easily.
2017,4,So far its Good.. but haven't finish using yet..
2017,5,"Combines all flights and gives you the cheapest options, but you still need to check with the airlines for any extra charges"
2017,4,Good but sometimes the prices are far from being correct
2017,4,It would be better if it could search for multiple cities
2017,1,Rubbish... Refuses to list flights I know exist!
2017,5,Great app.. like a one stop shop üòâ‚ò∫

2017,4,"Great for searching and always comes back with good results. Not all of the results are always available, however, when you click book."
2017,2,I have updated 4 times today. Is it a joke?
2017,2,"Tried to use for first time. Love the search results  and the layout. From there on it was a total disaster. Timed out while I'm entering personal data. Price changed in middle of entry. One vendor changed the billing currency just as I was entering my credit card info. Another vendor sent me messages right at the end saying price changed but when I returned to main site it was the same price. On next attempt they gave an error message that says there was a problem and try again. Then when I tried again it said that I already had a booking. But never received email confirmation or booking number. Other than no booking and numerous technical issues, everything is fine...or not."
2017,4,"Great interface, easy to use app. Tells you a lot about the flights but not too much about how reliable the booking sites are. For example, I don't like booking on sites that take your money and tell you ""we are now booking your flight and will send you details shortly"" where the shortly can be hours."
2017,5,Really good Please try to make alerts more reliable ie notifications or even text messages  Why not add an option to view one way or return flights over a few days or range if dates to compare (may exist already this functionality)?  Also it would be great to have an option to rate airlines and view their ratings as well as rate travel agents (with tripsta for example I have accidentally turned up at the airport only to find that a confirmation of booking is not a ticket! Trust me it was not obvious and I couldn't fly that day)...  Thanks great app
2018,1,"The app was working fine but since accidentally my auto update on play 
store turned on and it updated to the latest version no. Now when I search 
with destination everywhere or to a country, after I click on the 
destination city it ONLY show the cheapest dates, not the date I was 
searching with! Before it showed everything.I don't know why these updates 
needed when older versions worked fine!"
2017,5,Used it once to find flights when all my options ran out.  Turned out great.  Had to make a few sacrifices to take really early flight on the return trip and have fairly long layovers but it was worth it for the cheap fare
2017,1,"Not practical. Found flights, but once u click in, many flights are no longer available. If not available any more, why list them?"
2017,3,There is no multi trip option like on the website. So the app is only half functioning as far as I'm concerned. Other than that it is a great app.
2017,2,"Did an everywhere search from my home city, but the app decides to give me search results for great deals from other origin airports. Not very useful."
2017,3,"Great idea. However, the price shown on the widget, is in many times lower than the actual price when you click on it and get in the app itself. Why?"
2017,5,"Love this app. Only ever use it now for booking flights. Always has the cheapest options, have booked dozens of flights with it and never had any issues"
2017,4,My first stop for flight search haven't used them to book. Alerts very good especially long haul business.
2017,4,Good but please please please add options to book mixed flights like kayak can. They have loads of clever options to find unusual fares.
2017,4,Itz really cool to check the prices under one roof.. Nice.. Why dont u have multicity option in the app
2017,5,I've been using this app for about a year and find it to be very useful in planning and comparing travel options.  First stop I make when traveling comes up.
2017,5,This app its really good for comparing price flight. It's make an easier to plan a trip especially for arrange time & cost.
2017,4,Prima era possibile selezionare solo l'aeroporto di arrivo e il sistema dava un sacco di informazioni ed era inoltre possibile selezionare il periodo pi√π economici... Ora √® tutto meno chiaro e bisogna per forza selezionare l'aeroporto di partenza... Mi sembra incredibile che i programmatori abbiano fatto questo passo indietro pensando di migliorare l'app...
2017,5,Why don't you have multi city  flight search on App ? How difficult it is to bring this feature on App when it already exists on website ? Thanks !
2017,5,I make use of the widget of my flight details so I can track the rise and fall of a particular flight to ensure I get the cheapest price. Also get notifications when the price drops.
2017,5,"Best travel app made. I like it more now that the hotel, car and flight apps are consolidated into one app."
2017,5,Really useful to plan my private and my team members travels. Very fast and easy to use.
2017,3,Liked the old layout from searches better. The new layout with photos just sucks data from my plan. Lost a star
2017,4,Good info about things to note for all flights. Some options can be added.
2017,5,Best app out there for finding cheap flights. Alerts are great!

2017,5,Booking a trip is much easier without having to compare all the prices on your own
2019,5,itz best for checking flights... ths is easy for use also...
2017,3,"Couldn't find the option to search for multiple destinations. For roundtrips, it's nice"
2017,2,"Missing a key function to select date ranges, for example I want to fly out between the 3rd and the 8th of june, show me the cheapest option"
2017,4,Handy app for flights. Too bad multi-city flights are not supported
2017,3,"Cheapest month option is not available in Mobile app, if this issue gets resolved I will rate it as 5"
2017,5,I think this is a great app.  The only one I use for flights
2017,5,Brilliant site. My bible for flight  info
2017,5,Great deals. Have booked several flights

2017,5,Mantap laa
2017,5,Profetional app
2017,4,Love it all up for me
2017,4,"This is my go-to app for booking all my flights. I travel regularly and generally use this app as a guide for ticket prices. Many other apps tend to hike ticket prices, but not this one. It's very economical and accurate. There aren't any hidden fees that you'd pay and my experience so far with this app has been great!"
2017,2,"Used to be brilliant by after the latest updates, not anymore. Bring back the easy access to the handy prices calendar/calendar  view option to enable us see in a glance the prices. As it stands now u can't easily see the best prices if ur flexible with dates but looking the best prices. Bring back also the list view prices when you look to fly Everywhere. Generally speaking TOO MUCH development messed this application. Is not as handy as before."
2017,3,"I love this app and especially the ""explore top deals"" . Today however it isnt keeping my home airport and therefore is giving me useless recommendations. For example: Im in Denver and have it set to Denver but it keeps giving me recommendations for other airports in europe and south america. Probably a glitch in an update. Hope its fixed soon."
2017,1,"Total garbage...You look for a flight and see a good price, then when you click into the offer, the price suddenly rises dramatically leaving you frustrated and aching for honesty. Then you do it all again. THE PRICES NEVER MATCH REALITY."
2017,2,"The app itself is okay, but the notifications became a serious pain - after searching for a flight once I was bombarded daily by price alerts and other promotional pop ups. After searching through the settings I saw no way of turning these notifications off so I had to uninstall the app."
2017,3,"The app does not work like the website. I can't check for whole month. Also by the time I click on price on the web, it's different when it moves to the next page."
2017,1,What ever the price they show on their site either it very old or they always lies....when they took you to the other site price shows way more than you simply can think of..... Until now I should say it is a rubbish App
2022,1,"I used it a few years ago and didn't like it. I gave it another shot, and still don't like it. 2022 update. Third try. Still sucks. Search business and it shows me economy."
2017,1,"Used to like this app, but had so many problems with one of their providers -&gt; gotogate &lt;- that I will use something else. Gotogate love to take your money, and then cancel the booking within the hour. Massive, massive ball ache."
2017,4,"Just started using the flight booking section of the app, and so far so good. Very helpful at showing me times and pricing for various airlines, and sorting is quite helpful if you want to pinpoint a particular time our price."
2017,4,"Great app, I've been using it due years now. It's generally consistent. I don't understand why multi-city or other a few other web filters aren't included, but overall I'm satisfied and always recommend others to use it."
2017,5,"An easy to use app, during my experiences with the app I've found it's really good for scouting out cheap flights for those times when you are time poor. Never had any bad experiences :)"
2017,1,Now users are forced to sign in. I do not want that. I deleted the app for that reason. Really a shame. I use the their website to check for cheap flights.
2017,3,"I love Skyscanner but on the phone I am unable to find nearest/alternative airport button option , as on a PC..it makes this app unable for me.. please add this in ...thanks"
2017,4,Not always 100% accurate but a very good way of exploring trip options and comparing prices. Definitely worth at least 4 out of 5.
2017,1,"This app used to be awesome but the last update changed the way it searches for flights and it doesn't look for the cheapest options anymore, do not use this app it's a big let down."
2017,4,It was far best app... now with the new interface is almost unreadable and not useful... Just a step before deinstalling... The previous GUI should be brought back...
2017,5,Skyscanner is terrific and great app. Very useful and luv the price change alerts. Told my friends about this as well. :)
2017,5,"Great live information for prices on flights, sometimes flight prices doesn't match the price stated which is frustrating at times. But overall great app and search tool"
2017,4,"Easy to work with this App, especially the location map. Hope you will add hotels that are nearby an important location, especially City Center."
2017,5,"Great app for price updates & better than using airline sites with their tracking cookies, once they have your dates you4 only going to pay more. Hate airline sites & theie misleading price structures. Why carnt they just give a price inclusive of hold baggage, seats, taxes etc ??  Instead of having to do endless seaches, it should be banned"
2017,3,I like this app but I want to travel to 4 different destinations and I'm not given this option.  Unfortunately I will have to look elsewhere
2017,4,I would give it a 5 but it doesn't have multi city function for flights. If it does I'm happy to edit to 5 starts.
2017,4,"Does what you want it to, with ease. Tells travellers of caveats and conditions in bookings, and puts the best deals at the top."
2017,4,"4 stars, great app! Would give it 5 stars if you could add stops along a journey, instead of return or one way legs only."
2017,5,It watches prices for me and let's me check one more thing off my list. Love it!
2017,5,"Excellent app. I am using it for years. But, sometimes the prices on app are different from the real ones"
2017,1,"Doesn't include all airlines,  just what it wznts‚Ä¶ shop around prices are cheaper on other apps"
2017,5,It is great and useful app. It gives me a hope to travel üòÉ while other apps had no available flights
2017,5,I  love this app! I have no idea what it was like before but it is definitely my go to app if I am looking for flights.
2017,5,Best prices easy to use. No charge! Amazing app always using it :)
2017,5,For all your holidays and travel booking and cheapest travel tickets it's so far the best. It's second to none!!!
2017,5,Since I started using it I have not stop using it whenever am traveling because this is the only place you will get the cheapest flight ticket . Thanks for help me save my time.
2017,4,I haven't booked flights yet but this is a great way to see what deals are going at the moment :)
2017,2,It used to be Better than browsing the website. Not using it anymore. No whole monthb option.
2017,3,"I used it over the dekstop hoping the same I installed the app, but I'm disappointed it was not a good experience, the everywhere tool is missing that I loved most about skyscanner"
2017,5,"The app has improved, better services and policies are clear. Good luck"
2017,5,Found it extremely useful to find the best flight or hotel. Needed this for long long time
2017,3,Kindly add the details of flight named indigoAirlines from DOH..Starting Service This May
2017,4,It's helpful. User browser version and this app many years.
2017,5,Best app for booking fight ticket at cheap price as compared to make my trip app and all other
2017,5,"Excellent prices, easy to use and understand. No negatives as of yet üõ´"
2017,4,Wonderful app. Need to add multi city flight search like the website
2017,5,The app includes rates from every airline and let's you set alerts for price decreases on specific flights you're looking for.
2017,2,Sends utterly useless notifications/ads without any way to turn them off. Trying hopper instead now
2017,4,Nice app to compare and choose flights. Consumer friendly.
2017,5,Love this app BUT it would be awesome if they made those super special offers more visible from your nearby airports to anywhere at anytime.
2017,5,"Always use this app first to search for flights, then drill down to individual airlines to compare prices and flight durations."
2017,5,"Most amazing UI, very convenient and supercool application.  Love it"
2017,4,This is a good app.. one stop in booking flights
2017,5,Best add for flights as it keeps prices low since it doesn't store your ip adress
2017,5,"Better prices than any other website!!! Bye bye Expedia, Bye Bye Priceline!!"
2017,5,great easy tool for booking  a flight  prices are usually better the those offered by the airline
2017,4,Easy app to check flights; especially like that you can see a whole month to compare best days to fly
2017,4,Checks for flight prices and updates you about good deals
2017,5,Easy to use. Don't ever check anywhere else for flights
2017,5,"The world best app for flights,hotel,car ever I love it..."
2017,5,Book all my flights with skyscanner. Always finds the best prices
2017,3,"Good and all, but useless notifications are what got me uninstall this app. This app was no exception."

2017,1,Hate it after the last update. Gonna shop elsewhere
2017,4,It'd be great if you had a multi-destination flight option on the app!
2017,5,I always find cheap flight on this app. Love it.
2017,1,Kept coming up with no flights regardless of dates entered. Uninstalled
2017,3,Shame you can't search for multi city flight via the app like you can on the website
2017,4,This app is good when u guys want the ticket to see the world and easy to use and pay....
2017,1,"Not possible even to sign up!  ""Network unavailable"""

2017,5,Works great. Simple to use and quick.

2017,5,"Skyscanner always finds me  the cheapest flights! I love how easy it is to use and i love the option to choose ""anywhere"" or ""entire month"" to find the cheapest flights!!"
2017,4,"Great app. Many options, one stop search."

2017,5,Cheapest prices around!
2017,5,Goods for use this app
2017,5,Aplikasi bagus mantap
2017,5,Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeee it.
2017,5,Ok
2017,5,AWESOMEEEEEEE
2017,5,God application
2023,1,"The worst app ever, shows one price, click on it and the app shows a completely different date and price. Make sure you book through airline website rather than link provided through app and website to avoid problems and disappointment. Everything is extra and added when booking to agent link. Works out to be a lot more then booking directly and a lot less Hassel."
2017,1,"It keeps putting up reminders for a flight I've already bought (through Skyscanner!). Can't see how to switch off. Uninstalling. (In reply to the developer response below - do you want a screenshot of the irritating reminder, or the screen to switch it off that doesn't appear to be there? Or is this a canned response I wonder?!)"
2017,4,"Love this app. Never lets me down, however there have been occasions where some prices were much cheaper on other sites that can create an all in package of flight and hotel. Other than that it's pretty good 4/5"
2017,1,"I search for a flight from penang (PEN) to medan (KNO), since i have make a booking third time with this app so i don't check it again but when i arrived at the airport and tried to check-in u realized that this app make me book for a flight from medan (KNO) to penang (PEN). I waste $115 for nothing. I think i made a mistake when searching for the flight so i open the app and look for recent search and i never tried to look for flight from medan (KNO) to penang (PEN)."
2017,3,It seems okay but I haven't booked anything yet. Upon looking elsewhere I did find other apps and sites that have cheaper deals than Skyscanner. I'd recommend using more than this app for a really good deal but it's a good place to start.
2017,5,"One of my favorite apps. I tell so many people about it and they always end up thanking me. Truely let's you see how prices fluctuate for entire month. Makes it easier to find less expensive flights, especially if your plans are flexible..Love it"
2017,4,This app is super intuitive and helpful. Probably the best app for finding the lowest price. It does seem to favor certain sites (like Condor) but that may be because they usually have the lowest prices (or maybe not). Very well done!
2017,4,"Love the search everywhere function. Sometimes my friends and I just want to go somewhere, sometime when it's in our budget. The info is always accurate and really comprehensive (airlines and locations). Really feeds my wanderlust."
2017,5,The app is really good in booking the flights. Saves a lot of time. You can see the best prices available at any site on day you choose.. also u can see the rates in a chart!
2017,1,Don't put dodgy sites like edreams on there that just rip people off!! Look at their reviews! I'm glad I didn't book. Not a good look for your company
2017,3,"Kind of a pity that you can't book a multiple flight trip. Sucks big time, it does! Gonna stay with the website!"
2017,4,Best app I have used for years. The filters remembers your preferences. Make it quicker for future searches.   Like the alert option but it doesn't remember your filters so end up with details of unwanted airlines as well.
2017,1,"Tried to book with multiple providers get to the payment page and boots me every time on tablet. Also the total price is not the total price, many providers have at least $50 more minimum."
2017,5,One of the best prices here. Smoothly and intelligently designed app. Helps more than any other app out there in the market. Superb!
2017,5,It would be really good if you can adit the search to include only certain airports or to show flights avoiding certain airports for foreigners. Its a little taxing going through them all to see if it stops in a place I can actually go
2017,4,"Please create an ""any scotland"" option for airports. Other than that it's great. Scotland is a very small country and therefore most people would fly from any of the available airports but currently you have to search them all individually."
2017,5,"The app is easy to use and never crashes. Always finds the best deals, even on last minute bookings. Highly recommended."
2017,3,The app is not so accurate sice the change in showing lowest fares when browsing flying from your location to everywhere anytime. It does not show the lowest fares sometimes :/
2017,5,Have only used the app for flights. Certainly shows the best rates.  I would like to be able to put together my own package for return flights though
2017,4,"Very good app for all local flights and hotel up to date prices on viewing but I am yet to see if the site starts of at these prices and then starts on the add ons , watch this space !!!!"
2017,1,App used to be good (IN 2014) but now it's the complete worst. DON'T DOWNLOAD OF IN AUSTRALIA! BLOODY CRAP
2017,4,"The app needs to add in a filter for alliance programs like is available on the website eg filtering for OneWorld, Star Alliance et al carriers. This is the one feature that makes me use the website rather than the app."
2018,1,Old app worked perfectly... Now its just useless... have to use my laptop insted of phone... Fix it please
2017,5,So easy to use! The best feature is the monthly grid of dates and prices of flights; it allows you to match your departure and return dates for better savings.
2017,5,Good app. I love how it's rates the routes and it filters the best options. Great travel planning tool!
2017,5,Very good application.. Useful for me to find the flight to compare to others airline's.. 10 star ...
2017,5,BEST FRIGGING APP! LITERALLY SCANS EVERY AIRLINES.  I BOUGHT TICKETS TO IRELAND FROM USA FOR 380 PER PERSON ROUND TRIP !!!!!
2017,5,"Cool app, love the way they have designed the app especially the share feature which shares a snapshot. Extremely user friendly."
2017,5,Skyscanner is my go to source for finding the best deals on flights. Highly recommend!
2017,4,nice apps... but sometimes so heavy in my phone
2017,5,Nice app. Would've loved it even more if it allowed booking of the flights
2017,3,"Multi stop option, pleeeease.!!!!! This is a VEEERY basic feature missing.   Otherwise, cool app."
2017,5,Have been using it to price flights and will be using it shortly. Great lil app!
2017,4,"Booking my first holiday, seems easy enough, only time will tell (if i get a great deal üòâ)"
2017,4,This app is amazing!!! Never fails in searching the best price for airline tickets..
2017,5,Just started using it.  Yields much better prices than Google flights
2017,5,Perfect to find your next cheap trip. Search for any destination functionality is the best
2017,4,Very user friendly. Please also include options for travel to multiple destinations
2017,1,"Whan I click ""explore deals"" it miss a lot destinations. Terrible."
2017,5,"Great up, fast speed, lots of information for me to make a decisions on my flight."
2017,5,Great app with no spyware permissions. Needs the ability to delete history selectively.
2017,5,I can at least have an app to trust when I travel and it's amazing how it offers the flights for differant airlines . This app is Fantastic
2017,5,The first app I always use for checking flight price and schedule. Love it!
2017,5,My fav platform for flights. Makes pre trip planning so easy.
2017,5,Use it all the time. Love it. Dont usually book through it though.

2017,4,Such a smooth app from skyscanner  awesome company with a great photographer on Instagram. Very easy to use fast and smart.
2017,5,I booked a round trip flight from LA to England for $400 Will use again!!!
2017,3,Missing the most useful function from the website: comparing flights from / to multiple airports simultaneously!
2017,4,So far its been helpful. You can narrow the results nicely
2017,5,Haven't yet booked my trip but so far sky scanner has been really easy to use very impressed
2017,4,Great app all should try it..... Not perfect but close
2017,1,"Used to be good, skyscanner.. Now  it's changed"
2017,4,It's a very useful app but it would be perfect with multi-city mode as on the website.
2017,4,It's so unique app to find your prompt time flight to any where in the world.
2017,4,Great app....have been using for a year now to book international flights.
2017,4,Good application ... But with many defects such as currency changed only once with impossible to choose another currency
2017,5,Fast speed. .a lots function and more again. ..
2017,2,"No sorry, theres no way to select the whole month, i can only select a specific date on the calendar view."
2017,4,Need to have a more simple command while searching for tickets&hotel.
2017,5,"I really luv this so, I can search for airfares ANYWHERE in our big fantastic beautiful world. 10/10"
2017,5,"The app is amazing, it's just that if you can add multi city flight search, it will be very helpful."
2017,4,"Great app, but doesnt have multi city."
2017,5,Very useful and fun. Make your own holyday!

2017,5,Will Get Back After Few Experiences
2017,5,Good......
2017,1,Garbage cookies
2017,5,Found The Prefect Tickets!!!
2017,5,The bomb
2017,4,It's delivered
2017,5,What would i do without it?
2017,5,Looking for flights this is the place to look
2017,5,Just what u want from an app
2017,4,Product as advertised
2017,4,Okay
2017,4,Yeah
2017,3,Ok
2017,5,Superüëç
2017,5,thank's for everything
2017,5,super
2017,5,Gteates
2017,5,Ok
2017,5,Mean
2017,5,Goodjob skyscanner
2017,5,No1 site
2017,5,All OK
2017,5,"I'm still hoping Google releases a Google Flights app, but in the meantime, this app is just as good. Definitely 5 stars."
2017,2,"Used to be a good app, new version sucks. No way to clear or delete most recent search. The app always keeps and opens with your last search. There is no way to clear it out and start fresh. The clear history only resets filters not searches and it appears reservation prices are manipulated based on search history. Also, there seems to be less flight information available in the month view than before. I'm uninstalling and will only use the website with a locked down browser to hopefully get straight results."
2017,2,The scanner shows one thing and when you go deeper you realise that the real price is something completely different. I've been trying this out over the past few months and not once have a found the price matching the original scan. If it was off by a little bit it's ok but NOT when it's off by close to 200 USD...
2017,2,"What have they done? Just used the glitzy new version of the app. Dreadful! Used to be good, now navigation and search is such a mess the app is almost useless. I'm off to check out the alternatives."
2017,4,"I use this app to find flights. It presents the desired information very well.  A request: Is there any way to put n alert for a range of days rather than just a single day? For example, I have flexible travelling schedule. It would help to know which day the fares are cheaper from a range of dates."
2017,3,"Easy-to-use, durability and fastness in comparing different flights prices through multiple Airlines... Just need to put more flexibility options as Adding the (+-3 days comparison schedule) as it only shows my selected date prices."
2017,4,Thanks for making this app .   1-I would love if you add multiple city flight booking feature in it like you have on your web site .   2- I'm unable to search any flight in 2018 April even with all correct details . What if I want to plan a trip next year ? I can't find any flights under my desire holiday period .
2017,2,"Finds a price, then redirects to related website to conclude purchase, unfortunately the price is much higher the skyscanner shows. Difficult/slow to find price for adjacent days. No support"
2017,1,"No opportunity to search for whole month, not only by specific date (just like in web version). Without it pretty useless."
2017,5,Favourite app ever. Just love searching for flights even if I'm not going anywhere!!  So much fun and very user friendly.
2017,5,"I love this app, you can set up alerts with the app. They will send you alerts when the price drops or increase. You get the best deals with Skyscanner. I recommend this app to all my friends."
2017,4,I have been using it for quite a while and it's very useful and good. Will soon  try the hotels to see if it deserves a 10 . For now is a 8.5.
2017,5,"Thank you, skyscanner ! You have made planning for traveling so much easy ... We are able to compare all aspects before deciding to purchase the airline tickets. Bravo!"
2017,5,"The best app i have used untill date.. user friendly, many filtering options.. Great one.. kudoos to the team.."
2017,5,It easy to use and manage. Check search and with great offers. The app updates you about your deals.
2017,5,"Very good app to book flights, accommodation & car rentals. Seems to get better with every update."
2017,5,"Easy to use, enjoy the convenience of finding my flights at the price point I need using the alert feature. Thanks!"
2017,1,"This app is crap and a scam, you can go on it once then 10 minutes later they change the price but if you go online incognito and put the same details on you will get it for the cheaper price."
2017,5,This site has been great at finding great deals at great prices... tickets hotels it's been a great experience definitely a #1 site for great deals
2017,5,So easy and helpful to get the best price for my flights. Love this app üòò
2017,4,"I like it, it compares a looot of airlines! but if you keep looking for the prices on it, they rise the price"
2017,5,Brilliant..can't fault it..iv used it over 12 times last few years n its great..gives you a wide choice and the payment method is safe and you get quick confirmation from the booking agent or company id recommend this anytime all the time..its even cheaper than going directly to the airline themselves..
2017,4,This app is easy to use. App found the most affordable deal for our family of four!
2017,4,Getting more and more features. Should include price watch for multi city flight search
2017,1,"utter nonsense, you can find far cheaper flights by calling travel agents"
2017,5,It' even better than skyscanner's website. I like the details about the flight facilities
2017,5,Lowest prices I ever find are right here on this app and I love the notifications of price changes. This app is everything
2017,5,Great visual appeal of the app. Prices are most accurate compared to other sites
2017,4,I used to love the app BEFORE THE LAST UPDATE .. please get back the last version
2017,5,Good app. Pretty much use it to book most of my flights.
2017,5,I just love this app. So easy to use and get great deals.
2017,5,My first stop for finding flight deals... (psst...always book in September)
2017,5,Its a good app to list all flights based on prices and time duration.
2017,5,Really useful  Especially the feature where you can know the price range while setting dates

2017,4,"Just downloaded today, so I haven't used it much yet, good so far"

2017,4,"Very good for booking air tickets, not sure about the hotel booking."
2017,4,Very easy to use and handy for finding flights via multiple sources.
2017,5,"Top banana... Actually does what it claims, excellently üòé"
2017,4,Very useful. You may save a lot of money.
2017,5,Easy to use. Great app.... :-)
2017,3,Doesn't meet the website functionality for flights ... yet

2017,3,The GUI can get better else good work
2017,4,Great app and very easy too use.
2017,5,Good detail with layover. Have no problem resetting filters.
2018,5,Make sure you buy tickets at least 3 months in advance for the best deals!

2017,5,"Overall very good app , easy to use."

2017,5,"Very useful price checker, indispensable for frequent traveller."

2017,5,Very convenient for finding deals on the fly or in advance.
2017,5,"Brilliant app, use this anytime I go away for flights"
2017,5,I always find great prices and when patient and flexible I find amazing prices!
2017,5,Great app. Keep up the good work
2017,3,They show different prices on different pages.
2017,4,Works so I guess that's what you want from a app :D

2017,3,It'd be nice to have a filter for flights that you don't care what airport in an area you fly to but as long as it's the same one you depart from as well eg Belfast city airport to any in London but it'll say arrive in Heathrow and return from Luton etc I'd like it to either be to and from Heathrow or to and from Luton etc it'd make planning a trip much easier and I definitely want to get into the beta testing
2017,2,"It keeps erroring with the message ""Unable to create price alert"". Since this is the reason I am trying the app, it is now useless. Uninstalling."
2017,4,I like anywhere feature. I just looks for cheap destinations and choose. We often fly to places we haven't thought of
2017,5,Amazing app!!  Really useful I always brone my flights and hotels though this application!  Thanks!!
2017,3,"Some sort of bug when you try to filter by arrival time: say you choose to filter flight arriving before 20:00,  it will include flight arriving before 20:00 on the next day."
2017,5,Can't say enough about this app! It does all the work for you!! Super star app!
2017,2,"Incredible how people manage to ""improve"" and ruin something that has previously worked perfectly well !?? Uninstalling.."
2017,5,"Aplikasi yg sama membantu, mudah dan cepat, recomended"
2017,4,Like it. Fast response all times
2017,5,Very helpful when your pockets are short and there's an emergency
2017,4,Nice app.... keep going
2017,5,"Great app, happy with search results"
2017,5,very simple and useful ~!!!
2017,5,Great app
2017,5,Adorable app
2017,5,It's great
2017,5,Just what I need
2017,5,"Great services, no hassle, quick and easy! I will definitely use again and again...!!"
2017,2,"What happened to the previous builds? This new design is nice and all, but now at the expense of function. Instead of getting 60+ flight results when searching everywhere, I get like 10-15 total countries/islands. The price tends to change more than advertised, too. I'll just use the site instead. Maybe this bothers me more as someone who like to travel to less known destinations. At least give us an option to switch to the older layout."
2017,1,"The new update makes it more difficult to search for direct flights to ""everywhere"". If it's really an app to enable people to get the cheapest flights then enable people to search for them easily! The previous version was 5 stars. Why do I have to sign in? I'm just going to use the online version."
2017,2,"Doesn't give accurate prices anymore, price shows and when you select it the price is often much more expensive than advertised. Happened numerous times in past 2 weeks. Seems like companies are using it to gain traffic to their websites"
2017,2,"I love the Skyscanner website however the app is useless as you are not able to view 'whole month' flights. Also via Google search if your using a tablet, it directs you straight to the app which is rubbish. If Skyscanner makes it possible to use the whole month flight view via the app, it will get 5 stars from me."
2017,2,Used to be a slick app but it is now annoying. It is spamming me with suggested flight searches to places I have never searched for. EDIT - Marked down an extra star because Devs asked for a mark up. Fix the annoyances first fellas!
2017,5,"Used to be excellent Now the prices indicated are not accurate when you click the link. Also when you select currency (I use AUD) it displays well.  Then you click the link and that price becomes the same number in USD. A 33% price difference. Upward. $1AUD is about 0.76US so a $600 AUD fare (click link) becomes $600 USD which converts to $794 AUD There seems to be too many ""promoted"" flights before you get to the ones you're after. Used it last night.  Got frustrated.  Just went straight to the AirAsia website and saved myself grief."
2017,1,"New user interface turned this app into an absolute trash. I loved the old version but the new one is absolutely unintuitive, awkward to use and completely unnecessary. Why was this needed? It wasn't. I'll go use other apps. Uninstalled."
2017,4,... the whole price comparison concept is broken by the fact that some fares include baggage cost and others don't. Why not standardize on one hold bag and then show the discount if there is an option not to take a bag.  One more thing- I could not figure out what the downward arrows on the bar chart mean.
2017,1,"Seems to have turned into an advert for Chinese airlines. Poor prices, rubbish routing. Used to be the best, now I am installing other apps. Don't bother with this anymore. It's garbage."
2017,5,"I love your app because it stipulates the cheapest flights which will come for 02 weeks or 1 month. It is easy for me to plan ahead. However, it could be great if you disclose the cheapest flights for 02 months because this duration is ideal for me to save money and prepare the interiary."
2017,5,"Best app I found for looking for flights. Has all the features you want, the hotel searching feature seems to be alright as well. Never tried the car rental so can't say anything about that"
2017,3,"Decent app with nice layout and design. But please don't send me advertising notifications, and even more important give me a switch inside the app to turn them off. This is really bad practise guys. I'll be turning it off in system settings."
2017,5,"The app gives you an bird's eye view on the total availability of flights, no of stopover and estimated cost. So it provides you a base in yr mind, where you can think thru it first, before you make a final and informed decision."
2017,5,I love this app! It lets me find the cheapest flights to visit my grandma. I can afford to visit twice a year now because of the money I save! &lt;3333
2017,5,I have used it a couple of times and the prices seem to be cheaper than doing any other kind of search. I also like the fact that the app allow you to watch your trip details for any fluctuation in price.
2017,5,It's an excellent application and helped me a lot during international traveling. One must try to get all the budget information.... I would say... Thumbs up for Skyscrapers....
2017,2,"Been using this app for a few years, its really a good interface for searching the maze of flights..  I do have a hard time to flag flights for price watch.."
2017,2,Just downloaded today. This app does not seem to have multi-city search capabilities. Probably will uninstall and continue to use the site.
2017,1,"Found a flight for 50 euro's but when I tried to book it , it had gone up to 300 euro's with in a few seconds. Rip off."
2018,4,I love the option of choosibg nowhere to travel and the app shows you all of the options but its a bit expensive than other sites if tge prices get lesser it will be perfect.
2017,5,Love the new version. If you're not dead set on where to go it can find you some great deals
2017,5,Best app for getting a quick look at how flight tickets compare in price. The color coordinated price ranges when selecting a date are extremely useful!
2017,5,I used to be a travel agent/consultant and this app is amazing. I love it. Keep up the good work.
2017,1,What happened? Why suddenly it's showing only about 4 to 5 results? It used to show a lot of options now I don't see anything! Please fix.
2017,5,"Got in here today, it's an amazing app. thanks guys for yet another app towards helping travels."
2017,5,"Simply amazing... Could use a few more features, but the best I've seen nonetheless"
2017,4,"Overall it is a very good App. However, when I get notification of multiple price changes from App, clicking on the notification takes me to the search home of the App and doesn't show the changed prices."
2017,4,Good flight searching appl. Previous versions were better as it showed ticket prices per day
2017,5,Amazing application with easiest process to understand across world flights at cheapest fares... ALSO IT GUIDES YOU TO CHEAPEST WEBPAGE
2017,5,Best app I've seen for all the details you want to know. More details on flights on their website they should include on the app
2017,5,I love to travel and this app is amazing when it comes to good last minutes deals. Great for budget travelers.
2017,4,Awesome app that's plenty of flight options and prices. Use it all the time.
2017,5,Awesome search engine for best air/car deals. Haven't used it for hotels yet.
2017,5,"Nice ui, and really useful info even including legroom. Fantastic!"
2017,4,I like this app. It doesn't give you every single airline but it gives 90% of them and good pricing!
2017,5,"So far, this app helps me alot in flight booking. Cheapest & Reliable app"
2017,5,Easy to deal with. Fast.. And fun.. It also have alert
2017,4,Useful price check and routing app. I've booked from it once and no issues.
2017,4,Great piece of app to save time in getting the best price flight to where you want to go.
2017,4,Great app! Would be good if you had check in options too.. maybe for the next release... üòÖ
2017,5,Very easy and with all options. Best flight app so far!
2017,5,Best App to search and buy multiple routes of tickets. It gives great idea on prices
2017,5,It's great to find very good offers... It's a must if you flight a lot.
2017,5,I like this app especially for the reason that you can track how the flight prices change. Thisbis awesome.
2017,3,"Can't find multi cities search flight in this app, while browser version is better"
2017,5,"Easy, really free, no extra hidden charges. Save $$$ for your trip!"
2017,4,Great app. But prices change when it comes to final booking.
2017,4,I only get flights by this app. I find it handy and very good.
2017,5,Very easy to search. Great filter options and real prices
2017,5,Awesome app sometimes it finds cheaper deals  which dont appear on google flights
2017,5,Updated: Skyscanner states they'll be adding Multisearch later on. And the mobile website has it so that's a decent work around for now.
2017,5,User friendly. Far better than the travel sites  advertised on TV
2017,5,Love this app. Lots of fun to just search cheap flights.
2017,5,"I think eat easy to compare other flights, usefully and nice get the best price"
2017,5,Time and Money saver!! Thank u Skyscanner team!

2017,5,Use this app to book all my flights. Easy to use
2017,2,Long time ago has multiple city to choose. But now is disappeared
2017,5,Find great  prices which beat the travel agents easily
2017,4,If it had multi city search option like the site then would be even better
2017,4,Works well but would be better if there was a way to make notifications for flexible dates
2017,4,"I wish it included Southwest flights, but I know that's Southwest that doesn't want to comply."

2017,5,Absolutly Class
2017,5,Helped me
2017,2,Loved old app.  This one you can only search month after you have tried specific dates. Not user friendly re your reply then my app must be corrupted. As I said above. Does not allow me to do it first time. Having been using app on a daily basis for years.
2017,3,"Need to fix the differential in price between the search page's guesses and the results page. Way too big a difference. Also, final price is often different (always more, of course) when you go to book. Where did the anywhere option go?"
2017,1,The tweaks recently introduced here are not helpful...so difficult to change the settings/destinations without starting afresh...shame! Their deals are probably good but can I find them...No! Oh...just found a good return flight between Edinburgh and Larnaca return...only a 56 hour round trip with multiple changes...get real Skyscanner.
2017,2,"First, no ""anywhere"" flights for the three closest international airports and no way to add DETROIT to my choices. Second, flights of 22-37 hours from Detroit to Dublin???? An 8-9 hr flight normally when I used the regular search..and the prices average $100+ higher than other sites.  I LOVE THE ANYWHERE OPTION!!  I was hoping for better"
2017,1,"Horrible new layout, forcing you to re-enter data EVERY TIME you want to adjust a single search criteria. Old app was much better. This version values style over substance"
2017,5,"Been using this app for years. They don't always have the cheapest fare, but they usually have some of the cheapest, and the interface gives you an accurate picture of price trends. Unlike Google, their flights aren't outdated"
2017,1,"Very complicated UI..And it does not reach me to booking,spend time to find how to do booking using this apps. I can't see the comparison on which is the best in term of of cheapest or shortest."
2017,2,The app doesn't display low cost airlines like ryan air or wizz. I'm better off using google flights as I can get insights into different prices on different dates to get the best deal.
2017,1,Compared airfares. Cheapest flights was $3171. Hopper showed me $595. Double and triple checked my inputs because I couldn't believe the high price. What is wrong with this app???
2017,4,Haven't used to hook a flight yet. Should allow you to pick a few departure airports at same time to compare and contrast. Please input this.
2017,5,"Lists cheep airlines like Spirit which others dont. Spirit ain't the best but it's a few hours at best and the cost savings is worth the inconvenience... if I wanted first class I would book first class, I just want to get there,,,use the savings for a better hotel,,,"
2017,5,Makes it so simple to search for multiple travel needs simultaneously & get customized watch alerts! I especially like the Multi-City search for flights. Happy Travels!
2017,1,I was using this app fir the first time tonight to buy a ticket from lima to cusco and evreytime time after I accept the payment it got me out of the payment and back to the app so I was sure their is a problem but then I went to star peru website and I can see that I have five resevation under my name. I cant do nothing about it now I just hope that I wont pay for all of them
2017,5,Good flight comparison tool. Always use it to check prices and more often than not it has the best deals. Have not used it for hotels or car hire.
2017,5,"A great all-rounder with witty features. Great how you can set up price alerts, dead easy and very handy when getting travel inspiration on the go."
2017,5,"Great UI, useful search settings, and very quick. I just bought a super-cheap trip abroad with zero hassle!"
2017,3,Used to be much simpler and use-friendly. Now makes you re-enter stuff too many times. Please go back to the simpler interference
2017,1,I could not even register. It would not send me an email. I checked my SPAM folder. Waited 2 hours. Tried a totally different email address. Waited four hours. Nothing.
2017,1,Why do you people mess with the first simple search concept. Are you bored. Now were has the ANYWHERE search gone?
2017,5,Very good app. Gives a very good selection of flights.  Have booked flights from travel companies I have never heard of and have never had a problem. John
2017,5,"Easy to use, very quick search, low pricing with great flight deals and safe to use. I find the app very attractive and will definitely recommend it to others."
2017,1,Best feature of skyscanner was the Anywhere and whole month search options... Now it has absolutely nothing original about it... Kayak it is then...
2017,5,This app really simplifies things. It's great for you to find the best flight according to your preferred time and dates at an affordable price.
2017,5,This app is brilliant. So helpful in finding cheapest flights for me. I'm booking my holiday soon!!! :D
2017,4,"This is very good app, l normally buy my air ticket any time l travel. No problem"
2017,1,"Useless layout with new update. They know how to take a simple app, which was working great into complicated mess!"
2017,5,Skyscanner remains the number one place to find flights. Whether it is business or pleasure. It is a great App!
2017,1,Sucks! I found the price $30 higher then the lowest price going directly on Southwest for the exact same flight!
2017,5,Highly recommended! I has been using the app for the past 2 years and have great deals.
2017,5,I have been using skyscanner for years now and it just keeps getting better. The price alert feature is particularly useful
2017,1,"I'm watching two flights with this app and it keeps on notificating me of fake flights which are never there when I click in. Never installing again,  don't waste your time people"
2017,5,"I compared this app to kayak, hooper and cheap flights and alongside kayak is the best price but it gives you more range of flights to choose from"
2017,5,The specific airways had different prices on their own sites and apps although those apps are not nearly as friendly or efficient. Still would like to confirm prices though.
2017,4,Easy to use. prices are great and they find trusted airlines!
2017,5,Love it. By far the easiest and quickest way of comparing flights. I always get the cheapest deals on here.
2017,4,Great for looking into flights and best prices. Easy to use
2017,5,Got tickets to Finland for half the price last time I went. Great app.
2017,1,Bad app not as on the web..  Doesn't show when is cheapest prices on the year..
2017,5,Great app to check and compare the prices. also liked previews in calendar
2017,5,This app is the best. I still think if a suggest route be included as part of the search
2017,3,"The app is good, but for some reason it doesn't have multi trip available only one way & return fair"
2017,5,Holy cow spit! This is amazing! Waaaaay better than priceline or trivago!
2017,5,Great app. Search is very efficient and effective. Really hepful
2017,5,Exploring flight directions is pure fun. I love it!
2017,5,Excellent app with great interface for comparing flight options. Love it.
2017,5,Very helpful and easy analysis... I always use this app to book my air tickets... No 1
2017,4,"Was a bit miffed at first, but later figured out where the icon was on the app to get the price comparison calendars, so was much happier!"
2017,5,"Never found a cheaper flight anywhere else, and the interface is very good!"
2017,4,Just began using this app so I'm not overly familiar. However I do enjoy the use thus far.
2017,5,"Incredibly helpful and user friendly, helps a lot to plan trips"
2017,2,"Totally stupid. Need to use the website mostly, to get it working properly."
2017,1,Cheater . Changing fares when you try to book. third class app. don't use.
2017,3,The app is missing some of the previous functionality. It does the job but not as well as it used to
2017,5,"Un'applicazione semplice da usare e sempre a portata di mano. Quelle volte che pensi quanto pu√≤ costare un viaggio in un weekend, √® sempre in grado di fornirti la risposta migliore."
2017,5,Great app. Very useful search tool
2017,5,I use this for all my flights. I love it !
2017,5,Great search engine.  I only wish you could leave destination on any to find a quick cheap get away.
2017,1,MAKE IT STOP ASKING ME TO SAVE SMARTLOCK. Clicking never does squat.
2017,5,Good application and the best feature is showing the calendar with the prices range
2017,5,Great application. Very useful and user friendly.
2017,5,Really easy. Use it for all my flights
2017,4,Just got the app so haven't used it yet. Like what I've seen so far.
2017,1,Every search lands up with an incorrect price and or flights unavailable
2017,1,It just keeps crashing. The older version was stable.
2017,4,Its good to see your wanted flights value change before you buy
2017,3,Did not work for me as can't search multi city flights.

2017,1,"Hate the update so much. I've tried getting used to it but I can't. My favourite thing about the old one was the two sliding daily price scales for out and return. You could swish across and say, ""Wednesday to Thursday have the smallest columns, so I'll click them and discover I can get there for only ¬£14! I'll do that!"" Now you have to select dates. Or their suggested trips for 4 days or 7 which is no use to me. So disappointed, and I guess I'll be trying something else."
2017,1,So i download this app try for over an hour to book a simple one way flight . First it wont save any info. Second The price went from $125 to $998 after it sends me to the airline website!!! Now on top of that  Theres no help fom anyone..  who ever wrote those good reviews were probably paid to... this app should be removed from google as all it does is redirect you to the airlines web site after you select a flight.. the times are inaccurate at best and the prices DO NOT hold over to the airline when you have to buy the ticket from the airline. Waste of time and data
2017,1,"Disappointing... The app does not allow multi-city flights, whereas, the website does. All other aspects appear to be the same, but read other reviews to find out more.  Putting out an app that is anything less than the website or that is not all it can be, shows a lack of business acumen.  Today's lesson: Don't experiment with your users. By the time you make changes, another app will have taken its place and most users don't change their original bad reviews."
2017,2,"Do not,  I repeat,  DO NOT update to the new format.  They've added pictures to every city which makes the search process redundant.  When you could just select any month and everywhere,  now you must select dates or month and scroll through hundreds of pics.  Read the latest reviews,  only positive (maybe old) reviews are being highlighted.     An no clicking the chart option on top right does not give any data. On latest update."
2017,1,"This app sits on my phone,  I log in to it, so it knows my name,  and yet every time,  every single time,  I had to choose Duration in the filters as it keeps on returning to cheapest flight. How much intelligence do you need to remember the last choice in filter? This is supposed to be a in a ""smart phone"". Unbelievable!"
2017,3,"Destination ""Anywhere"" functionality doesn't work anymore with the more recent versions. Used to use this app for close to 100% of my regular private trips (&gt;50 bookings/yr) and it is so frustrating having to open my computer for this functionality now! :("

2017,5,"This app is a must for anyone after a bargain with flights.  I love skycanner so much i use it to book all my flights, however am yet to book accommodation or car hire with it as so far not noticed a massive price difference from booking these direct. Love how they search multiple airlines and give you the option of flying with two operators if you're after a bargain.  Setting up alerts is fantastic. I can keep an eye on prices and availability without it taking up loads of time by having to do daily searches."
2017,5,Skyscanner is a great app if you're looking for flights and want a good deal! It does a great job of comparing flights and showing various options. I also find the alert function very useful for watching to see price changes in flights I'm interested in.
2017,1,What happened to London to anywhere option? Or from anywhere to London. There should be use friendly option to pick whole month as well. Flexibility in choosing your destination was a critical function of the app in finding a good flight. Now it's totally useless!!!
2017,5,Well done  It would be great if all the prices show up when I add a destination to my notification. The flight fare only seem to be visible when there is a change in price. I have a list spanning 7 days and would like to see all mininum prices in one glance.
2017,1,"Totally user unfriendly. 1). Why can't I pick 'any date' in the app? For example from berlin to everywhere the whole March. On the website u can do it  2). Why can't I choose ""fly from everywhere to Germany""? Or ""fly from Europe to South america""? Why can't I choose several departure countries? For example ""fly from Germany, Poland or Czech Republic to the US"". Make it flexible!!! It's very important."
2017,5,"One of the many travel related apps I use, but probably my go-to for flights. The 'Everywhere' feature as a destination is definitely a plus and has helped me on many trips across the globes if I feel the need for a weekend excursion somewhere new"
2017,4,"Really helpful to get the idea of prices going on. Best thing, as u check rates here, the airline companies do not get idea of demand, so the dynamic pricing by them is seen less."
2017,5,"Does what it says, simple to use, and has a good UI. The only thing i would like to see is the (not sure what it is called) flexible calendar view search Auto POPULATE  7+- days before and after the flight and include my preference for direct flights within the same calender view search."
2017,1,"Nice app interface, BUT they rip you off by tracking which flights you like and raising the prices. Must use incognito on an Internet browser to actually get cheap flights."
2017,2,"You use (I assume) red and green colour coded dots on the calender. Guess what, the MOST common colour blindness is red/green, so it is useless to me and many others."
2017,5,Unbelievably accurate & easy to use. Gives you various flight options to choose from. Keep it up guys. Recommended 100%
2017,2,No way of selecting all flights within a particular month make the app useless to me. I'll have to stick with the mobile site.
2017,5,"It's fast and easy, remembers my searches. And my favorite feature is randomized destinations, something regular airline sites don't offer"
2017,1,"It used to be a good app. After changing interface, it is almost impossible to make a sensible use of it. Shame. Forced to stick with website."
2017,5,Always go here to check flights love how it checks every secure travel agent and gives you the best price. Been using it years now :-)
2017,4,Good apps for traveller to plan their vacation. Hv color indicator to ease user to pick what date afford to book for in/outbound date.
2017,4,"You miss some feature. When choosing dates for planes, you only see a green dot which means 40euro-15euro, but not the actual price."
2017,1,"Error every time finding results. Tried on 2 different days across two different networks, same result. LON to Ibz always error."
2017,5,"Great app, easy to use, have used it several times in the last few months and have found it finds the cheapest flights and updates on price changes"
2017,1,Unwarranted advertising push notifications without any in-app options to shut them off. Did none of the developers learn from the airpush fiasco all those years ago?
2017,5,It's great to way to keep on eye out for price changes on upcoming flights.  And I love the way they let you know on the changes.
2017,5,"I love it! It's quick and easy! It shows all the results in seconds! The format of this site is simple, which makes it less complicated to use. I tell all my friends about it!"
2017,4,Great app! I wish it allowed to choose a different return airport like the full desktop version does though!
2017,3,why cannot search for multi city flights? missing feature! please add in the next update?
2017,5,Great App.. been using it for 3 years and never wanted to explore their competitors... so it's that good. Keep up & keep exceeding
2017,5,"Usefull and user friendly. Almost complete, like ""all in one"" app for support your journey"
2017,1,First original version was perfect. I checked again on 17 february 2017. Still awful.
2017,3,Outdated app. No longer showing cebu pacific flights. Promo rates not even that reliable.
2017,4,Good for checking flights.  you're doing a good job.  tnx!
2017,1,Sign in with Google not working without giving them access to your contacts. Why they need that? Why they need registering anyway?
2017,5,Absolutely love this app and you get emails when the prices have dropped. Had loads of cheap flights xx
2017,5,I really like this app. It helps to find the cheapest flight! Thanks!
2017,4,"Found very cheap tickets to USA, has become my favourite site to buy flight tickets from. .."
2017,4,"App is nice to compare prices and quick too, the only caveat is no flexible date option, when you are looking for cheapest ticket to a place, say over a few weeks etc."
2017,1,"Keeps defaulting my location to NYC even though the app knows my location is in WA. And it doesn't list the major airport SeaTac as an option, thus making it unusable for me."
2017,5,Easy to use and gives plenty of options for flights. Could do with multi-stop search though
2017,1,"This app is more expensive then using it on iPad or computer, tickets can be 100 euro cheaper sometimes. This app is not same experience as the website."
2017,5,"Great app.. Use this all the time as it has the best prices, a lot of options, and ease of use."
2017,5,I love this app not only for finding cheap flights but I also find great deals on car rentals.
2017,5,Superb easy to use app... if you have problems get rid of your phone as you are to dumb to use app...
2017,4,I preferred the simpler flights only interface. But still great app
2017,4,Fantastic app. Easy to use and useful information that I can act on right away.
2017,5,Very comfortable and easy use flight booking App! Well-doneüòÉ
2017,5,"Ready to use, intuitive, accurate. Everything you need in a flight prices comparison app."
2017,5,It is very efficient for searching for flights. A friend of mine who travels for work told me about it and I have used it since.
2017,5,Definitely glitchy when assigning dates. Typically have to several times before it finally accepts your input. A good app that used to be A LOT better.
2017,5,I use this app to stay up to date with flight prices. The price change alerts are great.
2017,5,Very useful! It's very easy to track flights price using this app!
2017,5,Bought a last minute ticket for a sweet deal. Best Travel App. !
2017,3,Not working.  Can't search for any dates.  When searching for dates it leaves it blank.  How do i attach a screenshot for review?
2017,1,Literally unusable since the last update. I'll just use the website.
2017,5,Finds great prices. I'm really happy I found this app
2017,2,This app is not even close to being as use friendly as the website..... hate using it.... love the website
2017,5,Gave me incredible rates for Trip To to my daughter's and put price tracking for future dates and rates
2017,4,Improvised User friendly with highlighted info...great experience!!
2017,1,"Get stuck in a loop trying to overlay. Also no multi city, useless"
2017,5,getting better price.. we ll see after booking..
2017,5,So useful for researching trips abroad. Use this app a LOT !
2017,1,Very hard to use uninstall it .. Before it was exellent new upadates disgusting  I took lot of tickets from this app.now new updates can't use ..
2017,4,Why doesn't the app have multi city flights only on web browser. I think multi city flights would be a great ... as sometimes web browser is too slow.
2017,5,The best travel app! For flights bookings I use only this app.
2017,3,The previous interface was much more user friendly.
2017,5,"It helps find good deals, and the UI is easy to understand."
2017,4,"Please add the ""anywhere"" and ""direct flights only"" option like on the website version."
2017,3,Doesn't have the multiple trip search like the online version.
2017,4,It's a great app.Very handy for travellers to get cheap flights.However there's no multi coty booking which is a drawback.
2017,5,LOVE IT! Never fails to update on flight price.
2017,3,"Please bring back destination search option ""Anywhere"". It was the only reason I used this app and now it forces me to pick a specific destination"
2017,3,Would have been perfect if it had multi-city support like the website.
2017,5,Great for finding flights and giving ideas for travel to new places
2017,5,Veeery nice. Everybody that travels needs it!
2017,4,New look is quite detailed and very engaging. The options are very easy to navigate too.
2017,4,Not a 5 star because through the mobile app you cannot search anywhere as a destination from a specific location.
2017,3,Wd be better if you can support currencies other than just USD
2017,1,Misleading app with an algorithm made in purpose to make you buy flights for the wrong dates
2017,4,Is good but I still found cheaper flights on different sites..but I still have this and only app to find tickets
2017,1,Horrible usabilty. It happen for all web based apps.
2017,5,good app. provide reliable information
2017,4,It's very nice but prices can suddenly change .
2017,5,One of the easiest applications of every use to book any sort of travel or accommodation very impressed with the pricing and the ability to put together such a fordable travel
2017,4,It's a very useful app to find the flights you need.
2017,1,"Terrible compared to the website, uninstalled after 10mins of frustration."
2017,4,Quick & easy. I always find the best rates through here.
2017,4,This app is great - so good to use and navigate.
2017,5,"Really useful app, I use it to find all of my flights. Great that you can watch flights"
2017,4,Great.  It helps me keep track of the ticket prices for a planned vacation.
2017,5,Useful I use this for looking flight and comoare the price
2017,5,Great app. However sometimes I can't select the whole month and I have to select specific dates.
2017,4,Useful App for Best Prices on Flights

2017,4,Results seem unclear sometimes.
2017,2,Inaccurate
2017,3,"It's a good app but some features that would make your life even easier are not implemented yet:  1. When you watch a flight, a reminder of the price change would be nice. There is a reminder for the prices available for the routes from all the carriers but after you've chosen the flight you want, you're not interested in the rest as much.  2. When you watch a flight, it would be nice to see the updated price directly there for all your watched flights. As it's implemented now, you need to click each one to see the new price... After you exit it, the price still doesn't update (bug).  3. It would be nice to see price alerts that display price updates and include the filters you created e.g. if I want a max of 1 stop or a certain hour to fly out, it would be nice to be notified about price changes for those with my filters only, not for a flight with 2 stops being cheaper.  I hope a product owner will see my review and request these changes to be implemented, thus making the app even more useful than it is now."
2017,1,"This is the worst app ever.  I just wasted 3 hours of my life trying to book a flight round trip to Rome, 1st on the computer, then installed it on my phone.  Takes all your information, gives you great prices (fake apparently), but when you try to  actually book a flight for their fake price the app just freezes.  Happened on both my phone and on my computer. Mine was on priceline so I called priceline, they said price was totally fake.  What the heck is wrong with the people that developed this app...can't buy any tickets on it for the fake price they advertise.  Liars"
2017,3,"On top of Sergiu's improvements I would like to suggest few things as well. 1. ""flexible dates"" switch with setting how far back and forward it goes 2. multiple airport choice for origin and destination (I don't leave near amy airport and can choose from Scotland and North of England as well so it's time consuming to go through all of them) 3. A calendar display with prices not just the one day would be nice to have a better picture of the situation 4. And if you really want to spoil me, an overlay with my google calendars so I can see if flights colide with other plans would blow my head off! Thanks All and hope you will find these suggestions useful enough to implement them in your future releases."
2017,2,"Poor update, no longer finds flights properly and doesn't even seem to bother to search if I change the dates.  Hate it.  Wish I'd not upgraded it.  And please don't cut and paste some corporate bs reply about how everyone else loves it either.  It used to he great, it's now unintuitive, complex and actually fails to work properly too.  A pretty good achievement for an upgrade. Time to move elsewhere."
2017,4,"Got used to the new UI. Still like Skyscanner a lot but would like to see an easier to search calendar when seeking the cheapest fare. Also, I don't know if it's feasible or not but is it possible to search the cheapest incoming flights to a particular airport? Would be nice to be able to back trace a path rather than do it from the start line. I often find other airports have much cheaper flights to where I am going and getting to that airport is relatively inexpensive as well but for some reason the connection doesn't come up when I search the airport I am from and going to. Hope it makes sense."
2017,1,"Awful awful update to this app. Just got a new phone so had to download the newest version and it's terrible compared to the last version. Image-heavy, can't find things where you expect them to be. The aesthetics of the last version worked fine and it was a functional app. I used to always use this app on my last phone but one look at this new version and I've been really put off. Roll back, for God's sake!"
2017,2,"I've just up dated to this new version and not very happy with it at all . Old version  was much easier to use and strait forwards , used it all the time. Really wish I hadn't updated now. Is there any way of getting the old version back on my phone ??? Also miss how the price was shown on each day so it was easy to flick though and see cheapest dates also liked the lay out out better too.  I read some of the reviews and totally agree . Please fix this app asap , hate the new one. miss the old one."
2017,2,"The app became unusable. Instead of familiar for many years screen, now there are some ""deals"", etc. Don't really want to learn new concepts (what's the incentive?). Instead I just use the desktop (web) version. Only for that reason I rate 2 stars, not 1. Please read about the importance of sense of stability in design and UX. Provide a ""light"" version app for those who just needs flights!"
2017,1,This is pure rubbish. Had an email update advising my saved flights had lowered to ¬£89. When checking the app the price quoted was ¬£93. On being forwarded to Ryanair site the actual price was over ¬£135!!! This is not the first time I've had this problem. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.....
2017,3,"Does not give the option to research multi city flight itineraries. I'm planning a trip to London and Paris. I want to fly to London, take the Eurostar train to Paris and then depart from Paris to go back home. The app won't allow for this type of search."
2017,1,"This use to be my favorite app but the last update ruined it.  The everywhere feature doesn't work anymore, it only shows US destinations when I search out of central America.  Use Google flights instead."
2017,4,"Liked it a bit better before the recent UI change up. Its still attractive, but feel there's a few small unintuitive controls that need changing. Its still my go to way of searching flights."
2017,4,"Well...am rather extremely annoyed that i cant buy tickets with a ""third party card"" on some of the sites that skyscanner pulls from. I bank via a credit union. As long as the Visa or MC logo is on those cards then i should be able to use it ANYWHERE. Not cool. At all."
2017,1,For some reason whenever I go to book on any different site its always in a UK version link everything's in pounds....  Which is stupid if I'm in Australia üëé can't book via mobile
2017,5,Very clear and easy to use. I would like to see a map overview of nearby airports to choose departure point. No need for the mobile friendly emoticon and mark...
2017,4,It's arite have not actually booked a flight as yet and I'm not sure if I've received any alerts I just rescan an get different price.  Review may change when I have made a booking so will see otherwise app is goodüñí
2017,4,"3 -1/2 star. One of the best app and website to plan ur holidays. Have some drawbacks where it doesn't show the amount charged by the other booking websites that SS suggests. I always have to add 100 Qatari riyals to the amount shown on SS. Also, all the airlines and places are not shown."
2017,3,"Good app, with all the features I want. When changing the filters though, there is no notification to say anything has changed. Not a bug, but perhaps confusing the first time I used the app"
2017,4,"One change I'd recommend - As a colour-blind person, I struggle with the green and red dots to symbolise good and bad prices on the calendar screen - Perhaps change these to coloured thumbs, IE, thumb up for good. Thumb down for bad."
2017,4,"Very good app. Unfortunately, the option to fly from a different return location is not present. Would be nice if thus could be added in a future update."
2017,1,The app has changed so much and now not easy to use. The desktop version is better (before there was no difference)
2017,5,Useful app. A very easy way to check on flights or a specific one without the airline company to know for changing the price. An easy interface  and good informations about a flight  destination.
2017,5,I love using Skyscanner for quickly checking out the best routes and prices for my getaways - and seeing the 'everywhere' option for those spontaneous trips :) User-friendly and straight forward app!
2017,5,Using it for my first time booking an international travel. Very straightforward and helpful. Filtering arrival times after flights is very helpful with planning around time zone changes.
2017,5,I travel every month almost... All My cheap flights are thanks to this app. If you are addicted to travel... It's a must have app!
2017,1,This app became absolutely useless after recent update!!!! How could you made it so much worse than it was!!! USELESSSS!! It takes ages and is much more complicated to find flights than it was before!!!
2017,2,I used to live this app! The 'remodel'  is very difficult to navigate and doesn't give me the same info that it used to.
2017,5,"I've used this app for years now. It's quite useful in directing me to the cheapest airlines to a given destination. Can't find the flexible dates option anymore, or the multiple stops."
2017,5,Very easy to use. I like the fact that I don't have to search 50 apps to find a great deal!
2017,3,"Great app, but can't find a way to go back to get the app to search at anytime. Would also be great to search for X amounts of weeks, or  X amount of month's ahead."
2017,4,"If you set a price alert, jump on it immediately or it will sell out. Great app"
2017,4,"It's Good! but there isn't the feature ""multiple destinations"" where I can find it in the web site version"
2017,5,Your app just helped me find another great flight back to see my family. Thank you!!
2017,5,5 stars. Always finding the best deals on here. Thanks guys...great job! üòâ
2017,5,Easy to use; UI & Navigation is simple yet effective; Best app to search planning travel/vacation..!
2017,5,I think this app is absolutely the best. I book all my flights with Skyscanner. Thanks
2017,5,Easy to use and simple layout. I've used Skyscanner to book my last 10+ flights
2017,4,It's good to have a handy app to check on impromptu flights or just to survey fr flight prices and stuff.made purchases via skyscanner before and so far no issues have rise.def recommendable
2017,5,One of my basic apps. Very good job developers. Thanks
2017,4,"Good to find chipset flight, but book from out of country sometime becomes risky, due to proper communication remains very unclear, at this stage to whom we can complain."
2017,4,Great app. I really think you should add the Open Jaw option like on the desktop version.
2017,5,Very helpful app to plan your trip and make sure you get the best possible deal...
2017,5,Excellent search engine!!!!  I want to search multi city flights. Can you help me?
2017,5,Awesome app. Would just love some of the website features such as an 'anywhere' destination
2017,4,So far gives me everything i need in such app. And more.. all details that you won't be noticed right away
2017,2,Not very good imposible to find real deal overpriced express over 200 flight from Roma to florence
2017,5,"AMAZING! So easy to use, has different selections/filyers, and also gives you a short synopsis of what to expect when travelling on a certain flight."
2017,5,Would be better if the search support multi date for flight. By the way this app awesome!!
2017,3,"A work in progress, needs mapping function of website, needs option of selecting regions and continents, more deals shown"
2017,4,The best flight-search. App is aesthetically pleasing and user friendly.
2017,5,Best app to search what flight you want cheap prices and website and also you can filter according to you preference.
2017,5,Does a great comparison of air fares in one simple app. Great travel companion
2017,4,Nice app. Makes easier to sort out flights
2017,5,Useful and user-friendly. Keep up the great job!
2017,5,Bar graph calendar interface is awesome! Best prices I've found!
2017,5,"Easy to use, finds the best prices! Great app!"
2017,4,Good for comparison and to get options when flexible with travel dates and routes.
2017,4,Very useful to compare flights' prices and time.
2017,1,Bring back the old app. What was once the go to app for travel is going into my bin.
2017,5,It shows very cheap flights. I'll never book from Airline website again. Never again.
2017,5,Searching made so easy. User friendly!
2017,4,Great app. Great prices and no hidden fees.
2017,5,Brill app. I love that I can see dates with cheapest flights on the calendar.
2017,1,"Huge price discrepancies. Prices were twice as high on the app, use website."
2017,5,This AP is awsome! Makes quick and spontaneous trips a breeze!
2017,5,Emirates flights prices are too much high in this app  When we compare to emirates app skyscanner shows high price
2017,3,Used this mainly for the search anywhere functionality. They removed that so I removed the app...
2017,2,In your site the rates are low but once we confirm the flight and try to book fare increases like anything
2017,3,Good app but spams notifications annoyingly.  Can't disable notifications.
2017,5,"Easy to use, price alert feature useful"
2017,5,An efficient app to compare flight schedules and prices.
2017,4,The App is good and helps find best available options considering the flight options for more than one airline.
2017,3,Its good to get all d different prices for all d airlines.gives you plenty potions
2017,5,Credo manchi qualche vettore ma per il resto √®  un'applicazione quasi perfetta dal punto di vista di accessibilit√† e possibilit√†! Non pu√≤ mancare sul vostro dispositivo mobile!
2017,4,It's good for searching top flight deals and gives you options for which dates offer cheaper flights
2017,4,"Sure the best but can be better, multimodal transportation confront and alternative route planning."
2017,4,Does what it says...preferred the old style but don't use it that often.
2017,1,It used to be great. The new versions are unusable
2017,5,I thought I loved Kayak. I love this app way more!
2017,4,"Nice app, i used it for my travel, saves lots of money"
2017,5,Best option for picking an origion and seeing where it is cheap to visit.  Especially useful in Europe for picking cheap weekend destinations.
2017,5,Great app!!! Straight-forward & very easy to use! üòÅ
2017,1,Can't seem to find an option to choose whole months instead of specific dates.
2017,4,Got cheap tickets on the fly and the app is very easy to use
2017,5,"So easy to work, gives good details. Love it :)"
2017,5,"Great app, when you click on a date it has green yellow red dots so you know when it's cheaper or expensive to fly!"
2017,2,No option to choose outbound and return flights separately without paying premium for 2 x one way flights.
2017,5,Great app. Great help. Love it! üòò

2017,3,"For 16 months I have been traveling round-the-world full time, and using Skyscanner to find the best flights.  Prior to recent updates, the system was five stars.  Now, unfortunately, the unique features that made this my go-to app (using an entire region for a departure search, and seeing estimates for ""everywhere"" not solely based on recent searches made by other users) are gone.  Pretty takes up site real estate, is slow, and unnecessary, and shouldn't trump functionality.  Please go back."
2017,1,Figured I'd try out the latest update since the last revamp that made me roll back to the original app. It's even worse now. I use Skyscanner for searching everywhere but now there's stupid pictures and only a few options. Can no longer find flights to all countries in a certain time frame. I guess they want to be irrelevant because that's the only thing they were good for...
2017,2,I have been using the website and app for years and just updated as the old version stopped working.  What a disappointment! The old version had all the data and just how I needed it. The pictures now added are of no use and I want to look at a month as a whole and not lots of disjointed dates of the cheapest and next cheapest. Why change something that works well already? I will continue with it for a while but looks like I will have to use the desktop version instead which was OK last time I checked.
2017,1,"As a long time veteran user of Skyscanner, I have recommended it to a vast number of my traveller friends and family. However, whilst I still recommend the Web version, the app is redundant. I need to have the same features on the app as I do on the website. I need to be able to do everywhere any time searches. The app just seems useless to anyone looking for cheap holidays at assorted times of the year. Also, the explore section is absolutely dreadful, I like on the Web how you click a destination and then the airports drop down, you select one and a list of airports from the departure country drop down. The app is completely unusable, please please please release the old app. I really like the Skyscanner team, their website is fantastic and they have enabled me to travel much more, but please roll back this app. At least list an apk archive online."
2017,1,"Used to love this app, but the new user interface renders it pretty much unusable. Whoever designed it clearly never tried to search for flights. I always do multiple searches often from/to different airports and having to go back multiple pages to update a search parameter is just ridiculous. In addition it now gives you idiotic notifications for flights you previously searched for and no way to switch them off. Total lack of respect for users!"
2017,2,I loved the old version simple and effective. User had choice to pick cheapest fare from the calendar but now it's only estimated fare if I want now the price I have select every single day which is time consuming. There is no option to select the multiple cities it only give two city option. Please add old feature of exact price no estimate. Add multiple city option. Thank you
2016,4,"Easy to search, buy tickets, and daydream about flying somewhere. BUT, I really miss radome flights search option that they did away with a few updates ago. I loved the ability to see how much a flight to Barbados, or Greenland, or Newark were just encase I had that extra money to burn for a random ticket some where. It honestly was my favorite feature of the app. If they bring it back it will be the top travel app, hands down."
2017,2,Was much better when it was flights only. I loved where I could check my flexible dates with the bar graph for the month. Now it is just like any other travel search app. If this feature still exists then I rate it the same because it's user friendliness just went down.
2017,2,"Perfect example of how a good user experience can be damaged through updates. It used to be great, now it's just another app with unintuitive layout. I used to display prices for the whole month, now I don't even know if it's possible. Really disappointing new interface."
2017,4,"I like the ""anywhere"" destination option which shows you the cheapest flights from a particular airport. Picked up tickets r/t from Portland to Orange County, direct flight, good travel times for just over $100 each. If your flexible with your travel dates and want to explore new places, this is a great app. Can also search more specifically, right down to exact departure/arrival airports, dates and travel times."
2017,2,"I used to love the apps until I updated to the new version. Updated version supposedly is an improved version but I find it otherways. Used to be able leave the arrival field to everywhere and the aps will search the cheapeast flight filtered by country. But the new version, sigh...If only we can have the old one back."
2016,2,"In the past I used Skyscanner 4 times a year for flights but now you cannot preview flight costs just colour coded dots, if you want to see the prices you have to click every one takes to long. Uninstalled and gone back to the old way of comparing sites myself (got a better deal also)"
2017,4,"Under sort and filter selection, if i want to find a morning flight, i would drag the filter to ""leave city A after 8am"" and ""arrive in city B before 12 noon"". But I could see both morning and overnight flights after this filter is selected. This app would be great if you could let us set the lower and upper bound for both departure and arrival time."
2017,3,"A typical case of too many updates spoiling what was a great app. Functions that previous versions had, like a fare calendar, or the display of flight times in the initial search results, have now disappeared. Making the whole thing less workable or useful than previous versions"
2017,5,"Really easy to use & navigate, I love that it gives you detailed info about your journey & things to plan for based on times of flights & your destination. It's very fast and responsive & comes up with a huge amount of cheap up to the minute flights to choose from. Very impressed"
2017,2,Until the last update. Now when I search all flights from an airport they aren't separated by domestic/international anymore.  I have to scroll through all the listings...kind of annoying
2017,2,"This recent update totally messed everything up. Can input cities to depart from or go-to. How do I get the older version back, this one's horrible"
2017,1,They destroyed a great app. You use to be able to search cheapest flight for entire month. Great if you don't need specific dates. Now.....just another travel site. So sad.
2017,4,"Pretty straight forward but a few of the companies that Skyscanner deal with always change they prices. Not all just a few, seems dodgy. But besides the extra few quid, easy to use and user friendly."
2017,5,Absolutely loved the app.. Since it intuitively allows me to search through many engines and flexible places is a unique feature.  Only one thing I expect is to get faster alerts as soon as the price changes and dynamic updates in the price from time to time.
2017,4,"Like some of the recent improvement, but would like to be able to filter results before search. As it could take forever to have all the results loaded and more than half are not suitable (particularly about no. of stop as I prefer direct flights for most of the destination that I searched for)"
2017,4,Very useful. But but lack info on how to operate it. Need more tutorial on how to do things. Like how to bok once u make a selection etc. Overall. Its the best apps to sort out flight price out there
2017,1,Skyscanner has a decent website but the app is useless. Do not install. It will brake your nerves. Whoever made it knows nothing about user interfaces and probably deos not even use it
2017,4,Finds all flights to your chosen destination and lists them in price order. You can also find the cheapest days to fly. (Only one airline return)
2017,5,Saves a fortune. Beats booking with a travel agent. For total independence on booking your holiday Always use this app. Finds cheapest and most direct flights. Absolutely love this app. Never use an agent again. Don't be afraid. Works a treat!üåá
2017,2,"I cannot say I like it. Difficult to use, and I don't want suggestions. I want the option to search and select by my own choices. Every time they try to improve, you end up missing the options you had before."
2016,2,I really love the app. But the new update has ruined everything.  Inam trying the month search but it doesnt work  it just gives me no prices
2016,4,"...a few months ago I found the cheapest flight to HK using the desktop version, and it didn't appear on the app. That was quite strange. Otherwise it's a very nice redesign and the app is always smooth. Meizu MX6"
2017,1,I don't know who took over this app but it has been destroyed. It has become absolutely useless. I use other apps and the flights are $200 more on Skyscanner
2017,5,"I didn't know this app until today. Since I installed it I already booked four flights at incredibly low prices. Really neat, the searching algorithm and GUI are awesome. Good work!"
2017,4,The folks at Skyscanner really do a good job with their regular updates to the app. So easy to use and more often than not comes up with the best prices. Recommend highly. ‚ùá‚ùá‚ùá‚ùá‚ùá
2017,5,This app ensures that I always book the best airfares. The flexibility to choose the entire month is really useful when you do not need to travel on fixed dates (e.g. during vacations). The option to choose currencies is also useful.
2017,4,"Defaults destination to your current location and won't allow you to set your departure location until destination is removed. Good app overall, could however use some refinements."
2017,4,Finding routes algorithms can be improved. I search  Cluj-Napoca - Perugia and it doesn't find a route. But wizz air has cluj-bucharest-perugia in 1 day.
2017,2,"It used to be my favourite. Now it's almost useless with the new calendar features. It needs the previous one, the clear daily cheapest price histogram"
2017,3,A very good app in terms of comparing price. But however very dissapointed that there is not no multi cities option!!  Are your going to do anything about this since its already on your webpage?
2017,5,It's a awesome app. Just hope for the next update it had flights that cost in the $100 to $200 range that will pop up if we want to book flights anywhere in the world.
2016,5,Well this is a fair but the price for most consumers is too much but if it was decided that if paying a American dollar amount or free would be a great application for the money and or for free  also for those in school and college the impact of the knowledge that it gives the user or consumer a lot more to be graded for ones determine mind to embark on a scholarship and term credit for the semester. .. thank you Mr.Mark Mudra
2017,4,Nice UI... I just miss the option to search with the Time as well along with the dates.  If this feature is included... Itz a five star app for me :-)
2016,4,it suddenly stopped working. it just says check your connection while we check ours. what happened. the feature i use the most is the month scanner..
2017,4,Does exactly what you want and really fm good to be able to put all the possible flights on one list. Would be 5 star if you could put more than 1 airport location in at once.
2017,5,"I use Skyscanner for all of my flight planning. I love the ability to save searches, to see which dates are more and less expensive. The flexibility is awesome!"
2016,4,"It's good for comparing flights and the dates to fly, although there are better apps to use in order to compare hotels like trivago... use them both and you will save tonnes"
2017,1,"What on earth have they done to this app, they've absolutely ruined it. It worked perfectly fine before, the same as the website. Please do not change the desktop site."
2016,5,It took me a while to figure out how to view the prices for the whole month similar to the web version but once I had that sorted it was fantastic! (when you open depart date there is a button in top right hand corner with 3 ascending vertical lines to check prices across whole month)
2017,1,"The new interface is horrible. I don't want to login or anything, no hotel, no car, I just want to search flights! Uninstalling"
2016,3,"What on earth happened to the ability to search specific months or entire year's for best prices. Skyscanner was the a great and useful program, however this version is not neatly as useful."
2017,5,Skyscanner is my go to app! I love it. I have tried using other flight apps but always find myself running back to this one!
2017,5,It's a one stop centre. No need to go to individual airline websites to check prices. This app has it all and very convenient!
2017,5,"Did have some changes that drove me mad, like reset of searches back to default eg I was searching for one-way and kept going back to return flight. Seems the history works ok now"
2017,4,Certainly a must have app if you like to be your own travel agent.. Just needs some more domestic and budget airlines as well.
2017,5,I must say skyscanner works perfectly! i compared it with paied version of azuon app & do not recommend. Thanks SS!! ‚ô•
2017,5,"Easy, quick & accurate.... I only use this app now for my regular flights to USA & Europe... have recommended this to my family"
2017,5,"I got cheap flight ticket on old version skyscanner, but after update the latest version I didn't get the cheap flight at the date when I using the old version. I try on my other android device still using the old version and I got the exactly same cheap flight?"
2017,5,Fantastic app!  Great to be able to see all available prices and to look at 'everywhere'  when flexible for holiday destinations! Would recommend
2017,5,I still cannot understand this kind of advanced technology. How can this exist in 2016? The thing searches tens of Web pages and apps and gives you the results sorted. Then you get to pick which you want to use and when it takes to the other page it this app populates all the fields for you so you only need to enter passenger details and pay. How do they do it?
2017,5,so wonderful!! easy to use. i can say this is the best app to searching for flight ticket everüòπ
2016,5,"Easy to use. Straightforward. And no matter how much research I do, most of the time I purchase deals I find on this app."
2017,5,Great app for comparing and finding the best deals. The filters work well and when comparing with other lokeminded apps have always found they come up with the cheapest oprtions.
2017,4,Uninstalled the app and re installed it. Works fine now. The places were not earlier loading in the arrival and departure columns
2017,5,This app is very useful. It provides all functionalities needed to manage my flights. It works well and has an elegant design.
2017,3,"I'm not sure what I've done wrong. It doesn't notify me of any price changes, despite making three of them."
2017,5,Was recommended to me by a European friend and it has become a staple for my international travels- every good adventure requires the right tools and you'll love this one!
2017,5,It's a very useful app but would be perfect if you incluide multi-trip option in order to choose more places to travel.
2016,5,"The definitive way of searching for flights, I have saved myself a fortune over the last couple of years.  Easy to use and always accurate."
2016,4,The deals option is useful. But if we can select a country and provide the deals. It would be more helpful.
2017,5,"although this app is not a direct flight tickets booking platform, it navigates to right site to process further. Good support for all travel connected txns."
2017,4,I have used Sky Scanner (and desktop version)  for a couple of years now and love it. Simple and fast.
2017,3,Very good app. Nice showcase for deal... additional info is helpful
2017,5,"Please go back to the old app. Not allowed to even choose a country just cities, not predictive anymore, hard to choose a whole month... you just destroyed such a great app you had. Awful."
2017,2,"I was watching a flight, this app failed at keeping with the current prices and proper alerts. I was able to find better prices another way."
2017,4,Great app but the lack of multi city fare search means I have to use other apps to purchase a ticket. Would be perfect if this option was added.
2017,5,"Easy to use, does well to my pocket and it's ""fly to everywhere"" feature travels me every time."
2017,5,"There is some changes in app it takes me a while to figure out, but still the best app to search for the best prices, really easy to use, thank you"
2017,5,"Excellent app, very convenient to use. The email alert is good feature. Thanks."
2017,5,"Love this site for not only comparing air lines, but days of the week and it has updates for specific flights. LOVE IT!"
2017,5,"Nothing else even comes close. All the flights, all the prices, all the options. It is still superb."
2017,3,But please stop displaying a Dialog when we refuse to give you the location permission. I want to enter my location manually.
2017,5,100% free and easy to find a great deal especially if your on a budget. Some flights as low as $7
2017,5,Love this app. Dead easy to use. Prob best of all the flight comparison apps
2017,1,The prices displayed are inaccurate.once we click to check the actual price there is quite a disparity!Pls don't get excited when you when you see the price range as it is always on the higher end:(
2017,5,It has a lot more features that makes your life easier. i only wished they removed explore trip from artificially giving low estimates on tickets.
2016,1,Because of this irresponsible app I have lost ‚Ç¨400 through bravofly. Skyscanner must make sure that the agencies it redirects are genuine companies...
2017,5,This app tells you when peak season is and helps you find and book great deals. It's also very user friendly.
2016,5,"Used several times to book a flight, very satisfied with there customer service and they will get you the best flight deal"
2017,5,"Always got great deals on flights, like this app a lot. Use it all the time :)"
2017,5,This app leads the way for a reason it's the best user friendly app. And the mouth view to find cheap flights is brilliant
2017,5,No b.s. its the best app ever. Find my flights really cheap and like I said...no b.s.
2017,1,I being daft or has this functionality been removed?! Why?! EDIT - You have asked me to submit screenshots but your link doesn't work...
2017,5,It's the only app I use to book my flights. Extremely user friendly and the ability to check prices and deals is a plus.
2017,5,Haven't tried booking here but give me the best ideas to go with the best price!! =)
2016,1,No longer gives you the option to select direct flights only in the mobile interface absolutely terrible update.
2017,5,I travel constantly and this app has saved me so much money and headaches. Easy to use and very efficient
2017,1,I hat this app y because wen I saw ticket price in this app is cheaper than I try to book a ticket from this app thay show me high price on the date now I book from other site it's cost me 15000 and now again I checked the price in this app show cheap again I lost my 1500 RS what is going on
2017,5,Always love to find my flights with this app.  I can see which days fares are cheapest and set up price alerts.
2017,4,"Now, everytime i travel i make sure i run by.skyscanner first to see if i can get cheaper tickets rather than just take whatever is published by the airlines."
2017,5,Easy to use and provides accurate information. So the two most important things are strongly present there
2017,5,Before booking your  flights please check with skyscanner... As it will save your time and money no matter wherever you go ... It is easy to use and will give you it's best budget flight  Price..
2017,5,Excellent travel planning resource. Used it several years. Always installed.
2017,4,It would be useful if you could choose airlines to exclude from searches so that you didn't have to scroll down multiple pages before finding a suitable airline
2017,5,I got the best airfare tickets every time I use this program. I am so much thanks to Skyscanner staffs.
2017,2,Horrible prices. Everything i see is about 300 to 600 dollars more than going through other websites.
2017,5,Great app. I like the rating system that takes into account duration and price of the flight.
2017,4,Good but not perfect. Every time price changes when you linked to the other site
2016,5,"I love how simple, flexible and accurate this app is!!! I've recommended it to many friend now and have heard nothing but great things back as well :)"
2017,5,"Very easy to use, search and book flights. I like finding last minute flights at reasonable prices."

2016,5,Only improvement is better accuracy with the prices.  I.e. you click through and they're different

2017,3,I was not alerted about price increases on my chosen flights I had to search the schedules myself
2017,5,Found loads of great flight deals here. Easy to use.
2017,4,One of the most useful feature of the Skyscanner engine is to search without destination (look for the cheapest one) and is not available in the app (yes in the web)

2017,4,"I only use this app to keep track of flight prices so I can only review how great that it, and boy it's great"
2017,1,The pricing is wrong. Even on off season the tickets are too expensive.
2017,5,I would just add a filter so one can see the flights offered directly by the air companies bypassing all the other agencies.

2016,4,very good app. it's gonna be cool if you add blacklist feature. Because there's is very cheap airlines in Indonesia I want to block. I want to search the cheapest deal. but that airlines keep poping up. I want to buy cheapest ticket but not from that airlines.
2016,3,"Can't really make use of this app as most all of my trips are multi-city, but only one way and round trip are supported in the app. Multi-city is available on its website but not here. This is a serious limitation in my opinion."
2016,5,"Out of all the websites that offer deals, Skyscanner is the best. They manage to truly list the cheapest flights, hotels and car rentals. Let's just say it has saved me money plenty of times."
2016,2,This was a good site but find it hard to book a flight for the price it says .getaflight says a certain flight leaving at a certain time at a certain price when you click on it you find the flight is not available or the price has gone up and am not talking penny's here and a week later it's still averting the same flight at the same price it's a con by getaflight not Skyscanner but there letting it happen there not monitoring it just letting it happen very disappointed
2016,4,Good functionality for searching air fair offers quickly. Price change notification to ones email address are also great. Only graphics and contrast of GUI elements should be better.
2016,5,"helps to quickly obtain the flights solutions, compare prices and routs and shows the flights suppliers too.  Great user-friendly app! the app itself works very well and seems safe"
2016,3,"Its cool, but have to say it, it was better with the chart and calendar option, and also if you hit everywhere you dont have the full list of prices for all places, u only got a couple of random options, check that, that was the cool and useful part. Greetings"
2016,5,"Although I've yet to book through, the fact that it can bring you all the available flights and sort them from cheapest to expensive is  a great feature, saves having to shop around and guess which airline will fly the selected route, love it!"
2016,2,"Lost its simplicity. Chart doesn't even work to check multiple days for prices, continuingly saying no data."
2016,5,"Great app, with amazing features. Allows you to see what other options you might need, like a hotel for an overnight stay. I love it"
2016,5,"This app is pure awesome great deals to anywhere in the world. I love it and have told all my friends and family  about it this app, some have started booking flight through here and have gotten the same experience."
2016,5,"By far my favourite travel app, always used for flights haven't yet used it for rental cars but will be in the near future. Definitely recommend it"
2016,5,"Would like to thank everyone involved, this app is an example of great thought-out UI and smooth interaction. Well deserved five stars."
2016,3,"I tested it, and other websites, (Orbitz), had it cheaper by more than 20$. Though, I like how it tells you the price range of the flights so you don't have to estimate when prices are lower"
2016,5,Love the graphic design of the flight summary showing the lay-over time in between arrival and departure.  Plus the site has reminders for the trip.
2016,5,"Fed up with trawling through airline websites to get the best deal, then found this... excellent for my needs."

2016,2,Very expensive
2016,4,"I used it a lot when planning a big trip last year. I discovered so many deals and unknown routes. I like that you can say check flights to a whole country. And to check for flights ""anywhere"" from where you are. I was In Athens and wanting to just go do something. I clicked and saw a great deal on a flight to Istanbul and I ended up spending a week in Turkey. I could have gone to Rome (‚Ç¨59) or Santorini (‚Ç¨19) but I always wanted to see Ephesus."
2016,4,"I love that this app lets you use widgets to monitor particular routes. You can leave the date blank and keep an eye on prices. Drives me nuts though is that the widget doesn't remember your filters. Which means it may give you a great price, bit it's going to take you two days to get there... This just wastes my time because I open the flight search and it turns out that the flight I want is nowhere near the price I saw on the widget. Still, the widget gives me an idea on trends, which makes it worth it."
2016,4,"Compared to similar Apps, I was able to find flight deals that other Apps/sites & travel agents didn't  direct me to.  I saved over $400 in flights.  Was able to find good car hire deal also.  This will be my #1 ""go to"" App from now on.  I read negative reviews on Tripadvisor re one other well known App for flights - so check feedback (-google search)."
2016,1,"The old version was SO much better.  Please could we have it back?        December 2016 update:  It just keeps getting more ""slick"" and feature-loaded - and less useful and intuitive.  I used to love the old, flights only, version.  Now my heart sinks each time I need to look for a flight.  Shame!"
2016,1,It seems awfully convoluted now. Used to like the old version when you could select a month and see all the indicative prices but even after using the help page can't seem to work out how to do it. I'm tech savvy so no idea how inexperienced app users will get on.
2016,3,"App is easy to use. However, they may not present the most updated prices. The prices presented through the search increase about $100 after I attempt to purchase the tickets & get redirected to other site, i.e. Priceline. I've tried to refresh the search results but get the same prices."
2016,5,"Found a great cheap flight, booked it with Delta and when I signed up for their program I saved even more money! Only a $300 round trip flight to Orlando and back to LAX! Find me a better deal with Delta. My friend was amazed how I found this deal. Thank you!"
2016,3,"The feature that lets you search for flights by months needs to be easier to access. That's one of the main reasons I prefer this app over others. However, this one feature isn't user friendly. It's very hard to select it."
2017,1,Very unclear how to use the new version and difficult to find the info I need. Wants access to all my contacts through my emails which is dodgy.  It seems like a good bye to sky scanner ...
2016,3,The old version that was only for air travel was quite easy and gives in one glance all the rates of the world. But now after update the usage seems more cumbersome. Can this be reverted as it was previously.
2016,1,"This used to be my go to for flight searches but the new interface, while it might look nice is not user friendly. I liked the simplicity and straightforward information of the previous version. Hardly even open this anymore and thinking of deleting it."
2016,2,"When I used to go into the graphs to see which days would be cheapest to fly on it would give me a decent estimate. Now it's claiming my ticket price would be about $500 but when I search what shows up is $900-$1,500 minimum. That's a wildly inaccurate estimate."
2016,5,For me this app really helpful.. even sometimes they dont give good schedule.. but still fine.. cheaper more than any website.. thanks
2016,4,"I've booked many trips using this app and got great prices. 4 stars because it often crashes, sorry :)"

2016,5,Ideally it's is quite good in comparing flights and brokers. But I am little more interested in information like if broker are trusted and sky scanners can certify them.
2016,1,Is it hard to stick to the main thing which is working? Who is that idiot that proposed these updates?its useless. Trying other apps...
2016,5,"Easy to use,could not be any more simplified. Always best value flight prices online and better than any other comparison site in my opinion."
2016,5,"This is the only service I use to find flights now, looking at other sites I have never found deals as good as these. Highly recommend"
2016,4,The revised UI is better again. Few steps to search. Thank you for listening to user feedback
2016,1,"I am still unable to search flights to everywhere, like we can on a browser. I have the latest version installed!"
2016,5,Have found better prices on  the app than online! Always check other options but this has the best priced flights IME.
2016,5,"I use it all the time, it was especially helpful when I got stuck in Singapore and had to find a quick way out to Thailand. Thanks for saving me."
2016,3,Was my 5 star flight app until the 'Any destination' features disapeared after update.
2016,5,"Easy to use, easy to understand. Friendly user interface. Would suggest it to everyone"
2016,5,It works well and been using it to find cheap fares. Very useful. Thanks
2016,2,Unable to search monthly. The IOS app that I used to have was so much better. I tend to just use the Web browser instead of this
2016,5,Skyscanner really makes it easy to find discount flights with the best deals. I would recommend this apps to friends and family.
2016,3,Why get rid of the monthly bar chart searches for different days ?  I can't see them anymore if they're still there.
2016,5,"This is the best app as it is very user friendly , easy to use , comparing the  prices from all other sites and shows the cheapest also"
2016,4,"Different prices for the same flight in application And website!!!! Anyway, this is the best one."
2016,4,Fast and easy. Redirect you to the agent that have the best deal on tickets.
2016,5,"Best travel app. I tried several, but at the end, I found that this one is the best"
2016,5,This user friendly apps help me a lot to find everything abt my trip....üñí
2016,5,I dont find the option anytime and anywhere under flights option. Only under explore top deals which I thought it was not an option.
2016,5,I really liked this app because its bring me the all information about cheap flight all around the world.
2016,5,I love everything about this app - apart from I often can't book direct from the app - it times out or crashes but now I just get prices and times then book on individual apps

2016,1,"So guys. You asked for a review before I could evaluate the app. I gave you 5 stars. Now after using it for half an hour, I must tell you it lags like hell. No, don't ask me to contact your support team. Make your QA team do at least basic checks instead of sipping mojitos all day long."
2016,2,"Skyscanner is now worse than ever before. I can't list all countries for all the dates anymore, which I use to like before. You changed interface to the level of almost not usable at all. It was really exciting before, but now it sucks."
2016,5,"Best agent tool to find the flights you need for when you need them. I flew with two new flights agency since i started using this website. Never knew I could afford them, having a tight budget. Unforeseen new experiences. If Skyscanner was a person I would thank it so much."
2016,1,"Kolejna nowa aktualizacja dalej utrudnia wyszukiwanie. Lot Dublin Polska - nie pokazuje opcji cenowej w zale≈ºno≈õci od dnia przy przeglƒÖdaniu cen, ani kropek w kalendarzu, ani wykresow. Kiedy≈õ tak dobrze, teraz tak beznadziejnie. Jeszcze jedna wtopa i odinstalowuje."
2016,5,Very good app. It's made easy to book my ticket. They have no hidden charges. Thanks
2016,2,"Since last update, it loses your preferences every time you start the app....so annoying to having select different currencies, and all again, over and over.."
2016,5,One of the 5 apps everyone should have on their phones. Absolutely amazing deals and user experience
2016,3,Currency and region changes on app exit.  Updates on Google are also in British Pound
2016,5,"Excellent app, used it for years and now again.  Quick, succinct  and practical.  Great!  Like Tony the Tiger"
2016,3,"The fiters don't work, hence, need to change the billing country and currency each and every time."
2016,5,"Use it whenever I travel. quick, easy, accurate."
2016,4,"There is a bug though, each time I open the app the settings ( currency, country and unit ) reverts to default."
2016,5,"AAA+++ App Fast, effective, friendly. Highly recommended!"
2016,4,It is very useful to verify to see our cheapest flight
2016,5,"This is one of the best app, I have never ever seen; so useful, so convenient & informative."
2016,5,Option of flight are clear and it will direct the you to the selected website for you to booked ticket...
2016,5,You can get some real good deals

2016,2,"Dear Skyscanner team, now the  pictures are gone, that's good . But if you use whole month search it just shows the cheapest offer for one day. So ur back to searching prices by yourself. Also it's not possible to search for domestic flights in general (Egypt to Egypt for instant). The app is far away from instinctive usage. It's so sad because therefore Skyscanner was the best search engine for Backpackers. Plz do something more about user friendliness. Thank you, Peter"
2016,1,"I will normally always find more options and much cheaper options by checking air company web sites individually. I was looking for cheap flights UK to Riga July to August, cheapest this app could find was ¬£600 while by checking Air Baltic website i found same route for ‚Ç¨400 and for ¬£390 by Ryanair. Will not rely on this app to actually buy tickets. Remember time ago when this service was available only via webpage it was doing the same thing, i though they will improve over all those years, but they didn't"
2016,1,"The search results are dominated by junk travel ""resellers,"" not legitimate airlines or ticket brokers. Be very careful about where you buy and read reviews before purchasing. Most of the companies they display at the top of the search results have thousands of terrible reviews and complaints online. There is no excuse for this search engine to allow this and I'm sure it's no accident. A few years ago you had a great app but I'm seriously disappointed that you chose to go down this road.  EDIT: Their response is meaningless as I'm still battling my credit card company over fraudulent charges from one of their ""legitimate businesses"" which is actually an Indian call center and an employee from that ""legitimate business"" had the nerve to call me in the middle of the night to scream at me over the chargebacks they got from Delta Airlines. Skyscanner WILL direct you to scam travel resellers."
2016,2,"Searching for a flight to Tokyo get an ad. for Chile???? Used to be my favourite app, now just like a web site. Am searching for the much better older version, ie the Skyscanner that 100% fit my needs in the past, and was cool. Don't tell me you are continually improving the new app, just restore the old one and save yourself the time. Down to 2 star now."
2016,5,I couldn't live without this app! It's brilliant for checking and booking flights. It checks all combinations - airlines and times. Really versatile. Can also use it to sync and book my friends when we plan a city break - all from different airports and even different countries. Also remembers searches so you don't have to keep inputting same information. Excellent.
2016,3,It is an ok app. The only thing is that sometimes the prices shown on the app do not match the flight website...which is pretty frustrating. I happened to me several times with flights on FlightHub and Travel2be.
2016,1,Skyscanner should be more caraful about who they partner with. Some 'deals' don't even link to secure websites (https) for payment and the app doesn't make it clear (!). Skyscanner is therefore a dodgy app with dodgy 3rd party deals.
2016,3,I like skyscanner web & have booked flights thru it also....However one thing which i dont like about d mobile app is that while showing cheapest flights in any month d app shows a price range with green/orange dots whereas d website shows exact value.....So i fnd d website better than d app.
2016,3,"They corrected the widget problem. And all the old features I liked are back.  But, there is a very limited choice for flight if you look to everywhere."
2016,5,It scans the various trouble websites ore prices list them for you and lets you compare. Simple and effective does the job you need to find competitive pricing. Keep up the great work guys
2016,1,"The app used to be great.  You have ruined it by moving to the useless ""tiles"" concept.  Please bring back the much more useful chart format."
2016,1,It used to be good. Now the format has change its just not user friendly. The person who changed the format should be sacked because he is clearly not in touch with the consumer
2016,5,So far it doesn't come out with any error. Simple and direct me to get the flight I want with the cheapest price. But it doesn't offer multi-city flight.
2016,1,This could be a lesson on how to take a wonderful App & completely mess it up. The whole thing about Skycanner before was that you could put in approximate dates and scroll through the months with the cost and availability displayed in that initiative wonderful manner using bars. This is completely gone now.
2016,5,"Skyscanner is OUTSTANDING!! As a lover of travel and planning and finding deals, this does A TON of work for me, sweet! Thank you! Just starting using app, and no issues thus far."
2016,1,I couldn't agree more with Greg S. I prefer the old version where it is more friendly. Used to love your cheapest statistics month analysis throughout the year.
2016,5,I call myself a traveling wife and mom. I live in WA with my daughter while my husband (who's military) is stationed in Germany. I'm constantly traveling to visit him as well as other family living in Hawaii. This app is a life/money saver for me. LOVE IT.
2016,5,"So far so good, haven't actually booked a flight but it's so easy to use. Sure does give me the urge to travel!"
2016,3,"Is there a way to search for a minimum amount of time for the vacation?  Don't wanna go to China for 3 days and when I'm searching for destinations : everywhere, it does find the cheap dates,  but no way to ask for at least a month of stay.."
2016,1,Flight deals to everywhere basically useless now. Pls remove all the updates. The first version is the best.
2016,5,"Good app. The only thing, when you want change the date of the flight for search it takes you back to beginning."
2016,4,Preferred it SO much more before the update. However I use this app all the time so I'd be lost without it
2016,5,"This app is really helpful to arrange my trip. From family, business, to backpacker journey. Thanks."
2016,1,"Rispetto a quelle precedenti, questa √® la versione pi√π incomprensibile e vincolante nella ricerca delle soluzioni pi√π adatte.  E di solito, io faccio tutto sulle app e via Internet."
2016,4,"button to clear/delete the previous  search infomation.now what u want to search,it will display when u re-enter this aps back and have favourite search function but delete function dont have yet."
2016,5,I really the interface. It's intuitive and easy to navigate. Wouldn't change a thing!
2016,5,Came up with prices for UK/US flights 20% cheaper than any other site!
2016,5,Very nice app.. can find better prices for flights accommodation and all.
2016,5,So easy to find best & cheapest flights. So helpful too. :)
2016,5,"It shows me the cheapest price,  and when it will be cheap for me to book my flight.. Goodjob, developerssss..."
2016,1,This used to be the best app. The option to see a week/month to compare best prices is now gone
2016,5,"I love that I can pick everywhere as a search option. I don't really care where I travel, just that I do travel."
2016,5,"Very good app. Works great, fast nd v efficient"
2016,5,Love the app. .. always prefer this for all my travel logistics searches.
2016,5,Use to source all flights and get general comparisons before final booking. Easy to use.
2016,5,Got me a good deal in my Europe trip last month and it's helping me get good deals on my next trip
2016,4,Good site.  Prices are always on customers' side
2016,1,"Could look at the whole month before, setup is not the same at all needs to go back, why change things when they work?"
2016,5,"You can find flights, and book them. Pretty simple..."
2016,5,I can see when it is the cheapest to go on a trip and watch the deal to see if the price drops!
2016,5,I enjoy that is lists cheapest. And also labels fastest. Does the work for me in comparing time and money
2016,5,Very awesome app! Easy to use and handy if your a first time traveller! üòä
2016,5,Can't find what airline the app is referring to. Changed my mind. App is the best.
2016,4,"Great app,  plenty of options and fast.  Only thing lacking is stop over duration filter."
2016,4,Good : easier to search for cheap airfare. Bad : lot of doggy agents
2016,3,The app is now full of advertisements and some of the basic functionalities don't work. Sad to see this.

2016,4,The algorithm it runs to finds low fares better and more focused compared to other search engines.
2016,5,I like the flight search feature and the overall arrangement of the content.
2016,5,I already a travel consultant in karachi. And this app really help me in every where.
2016,4,I find the desktop version easier to use but this is still a must have app

2016,5,Flight booking
2016,3,"You cannot search a flight to anywhere , you have to select a destination. I want to find a cheap flight and sometimes don't care where it goes to , it's a great way of visiting places I'd never normally go to . I'm sure you used to be able to do this . Why has this feature gone ?"
2016,1,"I used to be obsessed with this app, checking potential flights as a hobby and buying plane tickets regularly, until this bad upgrade, that is. I've invested time trying to figure out navigation, but this new version is all but useless. I stick to momondo these days. I hope you all listen to fans of the easy to use, no graphics version and revert. I would wager there are more of us than you think."
2016,1,"Very pretty but not a quarter as useful as it once was. Why hide the chart view away? It was the most useful feature. Also on the ""to everywhere"" search....The pretty pictures on cards mean no more than one country per results screen and a lot of scrolling. When checking into the headline prices I frequently find they are the HIGHEST on offer with multiple cheaper deals available once the card is selected. This makes the card results worse than useless. Looking for alternative apps."
2016,2,"Awful app since I've upgraded. I use this all of the time and it's so easy to find flights and see the best option . They've just overcomplicated it and added more options. Have to filter to get the direct flights even though searched for direct. Go back to the old version if you can. Just to add to this you can no longer search for ""anywhere"" or ""flexible"" or by country anymore either"
2016,1,"This app has lost its charm. It used to be simple, you could easily change the days you flew and the destinations. It feels far to complicated and far to many recommend destinations busying the screen. I want to look at the place I've chosen thank you! What happened to the amazing graph that you could use the see the cheapest days to fly? A big let down. I'm looking for an alternative app."
2016,1,"I read the reviews about the previous versions being better and I couldn't agree more. I also read the responses from Skyscanner and would say that although the functionality is still there that does not immediately make it user friendly!! Someone has tried to make the app look better with fancy pictures at the expense of functionality, as if a picture of a location is going to make you pick a destination over price!!"
2016,4,"All in all awesome app, BUT, to go into perfection and maximum convince to the clients, you have to : 1) add functionality to add points in your trip, for example, arriving in one airport and coming back from another, or adding another flight to your trip so you have more than two or one flight in your trip. 2) be able to choose more than one airport on the ""from"" and ""to"". 3) give you alert if you have any cheaper options on the near by selected dates."
2016,1,"Me and my sister were looking for flights to spain for december. Skyscanner listed prices, the cheapest being on hop2. My sis bought tickets from them not really thinking about it and the next day i bought tickets from them but something about the whole process was off. Needless to say i called my bank and blocked hop2, but my sis' account was emptied out. What is wrong with you skyscanner? i trusted you for the best rates in airline tickets, not to be swindled by 3rd parties. dont you verify them first !?!"
2016,5,"Finds flights at the cheapest prices, and looks great doing it. Super fluid, and only gets better with each update. Good job devs. The only thing I think could use improvement is the selection of dates. It automatically switches from begin date to end date, which can be confusing. Making this manual or adding explicit control directly in the calendar (double tap to set start date, single tap return date) would be awesome. Thanks for making this app so amazing!"
2016,2,"This app used to be great, now it's irritating me more than ever. Here's why- you type in your destination suited to your desired dates, it tells you the best prices from, you click on it (expecting it to be that price) then all of a sudden it's 100-200 euro more expensive? Totally inaccurate and a waste of time really. Please fix this as I never used to have this problem"
2016,4,This is good. Would you like add some ticketing web especially in Indonesia like traveloka pegi-pegi etc for more competitive and comprehensive ticket price. Would be very appreciate also if the price included icon meals / baggage.  So it will make it easy for traveler to decide their flights (should it have meals/baggage/etc.)
2016,1,"This app used to be really good and was super easy to use, it wasn't the prettiest app in the world but it worked really well and that is exactly what I want when I am trying to book flights! Now someone has tried to make it aesthetically pleasing by putting stupid flowery pictures on there and when I just searched for flights from the UK to Las Vegas all that comes up are flights from Manchester, INVERNESS or JERSEY! Really, those are the best results? Tried changing the airport and it loses the date range"
2016,1,"Difficult to do what I want with the app. Althought best prices are found, is difficult to combine availabilty with pricing in one graph. As a tool is very poor. Often prices not match within the same tool. Even less with airliness. For demanding users, this app is completely fail. I remember iphone version to be much better."
2016,2,"I used the older version and when I clicked travel anywhere, a large list came up. Now, it only list a few u.s. destination and 2 countries. That feature made this app unique. Now its just like every other cheap flight app. Big let down."
2016,1,"How can I have the prices calendar back again? The last version leaves no more chances to have a comparative overview on the best daily offers, or to find the best prices calendar, within the desired timeframe. I can't pick up any prediction on the best days to fly, now...üòî No more useful, like this.."
2016,5,"I use this app all the time.  I love that I can see the day to day price difference on a graph. I love that I can just choose ""go everywhere"" and find the cheapest places to visit during my holidays. I love that, upon choosing a flight, the app sends me directly to the website I need for payment. I highly recommend this app and the website."
2016,1,No option anywhere. Old version was straight forward. Why developers can not understand that more complicated  is not better. Plus this annoying message about location. Are you spying for someone.?
2016,4,I always use this app when looking for flights. Good usability and easy to navigate. Only gripe is when booking an outward flight the return often rises. Why can't a price be a price?
2016,1,Flights shown on desktop version do not show up in app version. Instead more expensive flights. No currency change. Totally bonkers. Who made this app?!
2016,1,"with the older version you were able to search for flights from and to everywhere with flexible times. everything was very logic, you got a very good overview. that was the best about this app. now the search is very inflexible"
2016,4,"Easy to use, friendly interface. But sometimes it doesn't show all possible options for flights. Obviously some airlines are excluded from the search."
2016,3,"I am not able to place the widget in the phone desktop anymore on my Samsung 5, says its not installed. It stopped working since the last update (5.5) Too bad since it was the best of it all."
2016,2,I could search flights and find what day had the cheapest flights now I can only see rough estimates of dates unless I go through every single date to find the cheapest one. It wasnt broken and now I still use skyscanner but just not the app.
2016,5,Never tought i would find an app that show me a view of the absolute cheapest travels to anywhere.. If u just want to go somewhere just open the app and it will show u supercheap travels from to anywhere in the world whitout u having to search a specific airport. Briliant.
2016,5,Been using it for a long time.. and it's the only one I use for all my travel. Personally I have never  found tickets cheaper than Skyscanner on any other portal till date...
2016,1,Lost the features which made skyscanner the best flights app...I used it for booking all my flights over the last few years...it was simple to find the best deals.  üòû
2016,4,Pleased to see it's back to its best again. Glad you can search for flights from UK to everywhere again. This is an important feature for me.
2016,4,A great app to find best air fares. A weekly view of fares would be much better upgrade. Love it as must have saved at least 2 tickets worth to India so far. Keep up the good work.
2016,4,Stored user's preference and personal information. Easy to use. Good if room details can be more easily to read.
2016,5,Honestly their is no better app or website for comparing flights and finding the best price. I use it first thing when I go to look at prices for flights. Give it a try or even the website
2016,5,Best UI/UX I have seen in a booking app. It's better than the site itself (desktop version). Congrats!
2016,4,Good site but all airlines needed to make a confirmed choice. Always use these for 1st search though. Why isn't easyjet on here?
2016,1,I hate the new app and have reverted to using the skyscanner mobile website instead (which still works the same as the old app). App uninstalled for now.
2016,3,"I like the ability to see day to day prices on the fly, but it would be great if the widget actually displayed accurate prices. I frequently look into the results from the widget, and there are NEVER flights listed for the prices shown on the widget."
2016,4,"I like the feature of this app where it tells you any layovers and long stops on your flight path, it makes it easier to decide what flights are going to work and which won't depending on your circumstances."
2016,5,I've been a fan of the website for quite some time and the app just makes everything better. I like to plan vacations months in advance to get the best prices available and the app makes it a breeze.
2016,5,"Love this app, going to be booking numerous flights very soon and this is the first place I'll start. Always brings up a number of different options to give me a choice of what / where I need"
2016,1,Everytime you want to change the dates you have to go all the way backwards where you have to pick the destination. You can't see different options. Didn't help me at all
2016,4,Good app but price alerts need to take into account the preferences especially direct or single stop flight options.
2017,5,"Good and awesome great Application I had ever see ,now I can easily  search for the flight wherever I want to go ,thanks you Skyscanner ! Muack! Muack!"
2016,5,The new interface just gave it that much more flair - easy to navigate and use. Well done guys!
2016,5,Love it. Really it explore the world with all price ranges .. i searched for simillar application .. i didnt find any.. its the one
2016,2,Competitors offer this feature. Also to switch from Business to Economy you have to go back to search criteria again!
2016,5,Been using it for years.. Have had no problems. Cheapest flights you can get.
2016,4,"I have flight alerts out there, I'm yet to book a trip but so far so good."
2016,5,"Yes, it used to be awesome with other features, but, it remains awesome with its new features.  Thanks skyscanner. üëç"
2016,5,"I use it all the time. It's fast, accurate and guarantees a very good price and the best travel options there are."
2016,4,Great app. Smooth flow and so easy to use! Thanks
2016,4,Just what i need!excelent app..thanks dev..now more easy to find the good timing for flight
2016,5,"So easy to use and great for last minute, cheap travel flights!! Have traveled way more since getting this!"
2016,5,I've used many a travel site app but this one consistently finds me the cheapest prices and most options.
2016,5,I always use sky scanner to compare and book flights. So easy and the options/filters work for me.
2016,5,Thanks for making so wonderful app. Keep going. Grow a lot. Bless you.
2016,5,Travel with work. My travel agency are retards. This trumps them every time.
2016,5,It's always been the best place to go to for finding the cheapest flights. This app makes it easier still.
2016,5,A simple app and nice interface for compare prices. Please be more easy to use app for us.
2016,4,"The interface is quite intuitive and easy to use. But i just use this to check the prices, and use a desktop to book the tickets."
2016,1,"Same say same route, app can't get the flight but website verson show alot"
2016,1,"Cant search direct flights, select month on certain page. Crap !! Sort it out!"
2016,5,"I've been trusting Skyscanner as my flight advisor, they provide the best price and its good"
2016,3,There  is no multi city option to find flights. Otherwise its good just lack in multi city option.
2016,5,Love that I'm able to check flights months in advance. Easy to navigate and used frequently
2016,5,Glad for information on app from support brilliant. Works brilliant thanks again.‚ò∫
2016,5,All over its a great app. Sometimes travel agent website open delay
2016,5,I use this app often and I love its ease of use. Great bargains can be had depending on when you use it. It delivers fast results!
2016,5,I always use this app to search for the best flights available. So easy to use!
2016,5,So far I'm pleased with this app and the amount of accurate information compared to others flight apps!
2016,4,"The App providing great search engine, but be worry, not all options are displayed, and final booking should be done directly from the airline."
2016,5,You can choose the filters of your choice and can plan travel accordingly. Excellent app.
2016,5,"Awesome app this.So cheap compared to travel agents,and always have cheap flights.."
2016,5,Very accurate and really gives the best prices I compared to all travel apps out there!
2016,4,I uses it all the time for travel plans we need to add multiple destinations or multiple routes to the application
2016,5,With loads of features and filters to find the best option to plan your trips in the fastest way!
2016,5,"This apps works as it says it does, finds cheap flights and sends alerts on prices drops"
2016,5,Great app! Easy to find cheap and fast flights with many details
2017,5,Very easy to use and allows you to stalk flights to get the best deals.
2016,5,really good service..the price is exactly same wht have written in a apps
2016,5,An app for all my multi travel search needs. Love it.
2016,5,"I love how you get to see in seconds the best fares from a certain departure point, and all the other options that make this app so good."
2016,1,App not find all available flights. Flight BFS - ACE not show flights with Ryanair.

2016,5,It s such an easy searching for flights.. luvd it!
2016,4,It's an app for finding cheap flights. It works.
2016,5,Im using both Momondo and this App. At one point i started soley using Momondo until i went back to skyscanner and never looked back. Bloody good app!!!
2016,5,Easy to use and find any flight ticket. I love it
2016,4,Would give it 5* but you can't add nearby airports when looking for flights like in the full website.
2016,1,Used to be a useful app but terrible design choices have made it all but unusable. Shame.
2016,3,Please do add a functionality that notifies users if there are airlines having promo fares or seat sale.
2016,4,This app helps me monitor every affordable airfares there is. Keep it up.
2016,5,"This is the most efficient app to book tickets at the best price, love the fact that you can pick a whole month options to compare fares"
2017,1,Useless. Stick to the desktop version as can only search exact dates and not whole months
2016,5,Very impressive. Everything in one place. Very quick and easy

2016,2,"I don't know why you had to change the interface, making it way more messy and confusing. The huge buttons with pictures make the whole app only more heavy without improving the experience. Too bad, a 5 stars product used for several years became a 2 stars app forgotten in a corner of my phone."
2016,2,"There is lots of harsh feedback on here...and I can see why. The devs have decided to make this more a travel marketing app rather than the solid flight search app that we all loved. The killer feature, Chart View, is hard to find and hard to get back to, and often shows 'No Data' for return flight. I preferred v2.0.18 than v4 or v5. Devs - think hard about your core users...are you serving them?"
2017,1,This used to be my fav app but ever since I changed phones and installed the new version everytime I search for a flight it just says no results! I tried to uninstall reinstall like the help page says but still no go... guess m just supposed to stay home during summer eh bro!?
2016,1,I booked a car from payless through aragus. They dedicated the money from my account in 5 minutes on specific conditions confirmed by personal email discussion. But when i arrived there i faced the worst service i saw in my life. Also i didn't get my car or refund my money.  Pure Thieves
2016,2,"Can no longer search for flights from ""x"" to anywhere you have to specify a destination and date. The best feature to search for what is available has been removed. Do the people who create and modify these apps ever actually use them and test them out? Not worth using anymore."
2016,4,"Search gives many flights with one or two stops. I can understand this on long haul flights but I would like a direct flight only option to eliminate these flights if required, such as short trips. However definitely a handy app to see all the airlines and prices that fly your required route."
2016,2,"Why try make something better if it's already perfect as it is.. new updates are confusing and useless. The app was very practical and useful and I liked it, now it wants to be pretty, what for? I'm looking for available  flights not a travelling adviser"
2016,1,"I've used your app so much in the past, now it's become an intrusive travel agent, it gives random dates that are completely useless . This not what I need, if you want create an other product, but don't ruin this one. It seems a marketing wizard has made the damage"
2016,1,"Looks nicer, but useless. Get rid of the  pretty pictures and give me info. Direct option not available until AFTER I select a flight. Cost calendar not effective. Much harder to search and find than before."
2016,5,"Absolutely, excellent app.  But i hope it gets better, your booking sites should use the currency of the country making the booking not dollars or pounds or euros. For example, I'm booking from Kuwait, then the invoice should read in Kuwaiti dinars only.  Thanks üå∑"
2016,5,"I use to pay alot for my flights abroad. But this app saves me great deal of money. Definitely 5 stars,6 stars if I could. Keep up the good work."
2016,1,"Now it's disaster, thanks Zeus I didn't update it on my ipad. Well, now I have a range of prices for each day within 600$ bit I don't need range, I need the smallest price for the day even if it is approximately, that's it, the cheapest price for each day!"
2016,5,i love this app. and it helped me so much by comparing all fare in one place. one thing i noticed the air line air arabia is not included in the system search... kindly check and add this air line too. thanks
2016,1,"Not used the app for a while, opened it to search for a flight early next year ... Total change to the interface, its now busy and even though the flight search is there the everywhere search and the whole month cheapest flight search are gone .. Well done in ruining what was perfectly usable app .."
2016,1,"Please put it back the way it was.Your app was unique and amazing, now it is not. üòû The price graph/chart was the most useful thing, and now it's difficult to find."
2016,2,"Really dislike the latest update, much less user friendly!! When searching for flights using whole month views I can't specify the duration?? So the cheapest options are obviously for one night..!"
2016,2,"Started sending me unwanted notifications, with no option to turn them off! I didn't install your app to just get spammed. Uninstalled."
2016,3,"Why isn't the app consistent with the Web site in offering the same functions?  To get full use of the program I have to use the site.  Also, have to compare site against app to make sure offers/pricing is consistent."
2016,3,You just have the option of one way and return.....what about choosing multiple cities and book the whole trip at once?! The old version was much better!!
2016,1,Too little to late. I have now downloaded another app which is better and more accurate than Skyscanner. And has all the same search facilities and more. Goodbye Skyscanner.
2016,1,"Now it's absolutely terrible. Wont search for cheapest month. When searching to ""anywhere"", offers only a few destinations. Absolutely worse than it was before."
2016,1,Can't seem to be able to view whole month now. Will have to find a site where I can. Sorry skyscanner but you fixed it when it wasn't broken.
2016,5,I have found many cheaper flights here than any other app.  It's easy to use too
2017,2,"I didn't find the button to track the flight I wanted. To complicated. Other apps, instantly."
2017,1,"Difficult to use. Limits airport to just one, should compare airports in area. Uninstalled it after a few minutes."
2016,1,You can no longer see the prices for flights on different days at a glance. This was one of Skyscanners best features.
2016,1,Thanks for support. 6 months later and interface is not what I want - bring back chart interface
2016,3,I downloaded the app and still need to use a browser because for some reason you can only look up single and return flights making the app almost useless for me
2016,1,Used to love the ''everywhere' option this is why I do not like this app at all. As you have removed the best option from there.
2016,5,The biggest reason why I use this app is that it tells you which day to fly is the cheapest. I managed to fly one day later than I planned and saved 50% on air ticket.
2016,1,Its rubbish now. Used to be good now not user friendly
2016,5,"Je recommande cette application parce qu'elle montre les prix de chaque jour quand tu veux  choisir les jours de ton voyage, du coup √ßa aide √† savoir quels sont les jours les moins ch√®res pour voyager."
2016,3,I preferred when you had the choice to put in dates or not on the app when you could search for no paticular dates it was much better I prefer the older version
2016,5,"I'm always using ur app to buying ticket for me and my friends, it was help me always for right choice, I'm really happy..... Good job"
2016,4,Good deals with flights and rent-a-cars üöó
2016,5,If you are looking for the best fare on flight tickets this app is the real deal
2016,2,This was the best app ever. Change it back or at least make it like the one in the website
2016,4,"Good app but not so easy understand the layout, make it simple please"
2016,5,I book all my flights and hotels with #Skyscanner !
2016,2,You have removed Ryanair therefore you are unable to show cheapest flight.
2016,3,"Missing the search option for multiple flight search, then will be perfect."
2016,3,So how do i use the app without the multi destination !!! Do i suppose to use the app for one way or return ticket then open the pc for the multi destination!!!
2017,5,"I use this every week and I love it, sometimes prices are off by a few euros but once refreshing the bug gets fixed."
2016,3,Why did you get rid of the feature to not allow multiple windows anymore?
2016,5,As somebody who travels a lot because of job I really find this app very useful.
2016,5,The only app I use to reserve my flights. I enjoyed flights rating in the app
2016,5,"You really get good prices with this app, download it, worth it"
2016,5,Great search engine and love saved searches idea.
2016,5,I have always used this app. Fabulous results.

2016,5,Super app
2016,1,Ruined it. Why can I no longer search for flights in a whole month? And then compare them by day to find the cheapest.
2016,1,"I wish I could get the old version back. The latest version is terrible, I use Google flights instead or the Skyscanner website now. App keeps defaulting to weekend trips even when I specify the dates that I want. I can't find the bar chart anymore which used to say when flights were cheapest. Terrible UX, buggy, desperately needs fixing."
2016,1,1st ever review I've written on Google play store. This was my favourite go-to app for booking all my flights. It's now too restrictive with recent updates. No chart free searches like before. I'm having to use the website rather than the app. Please revert back to old format as it was much more user friendly!!
2016,1,"This used to be my favorite app for finding flights, but the app is basically useless to me now since I can no longer choose the option to search for the cheapest dates to fly. For example, before all of the upgrades, I could select my starting city and say I wanted to go to Nepal and it would find the cheapest date to fly. Not anymore. The website is still amazing, but the app is awful for me now."
2016,1,"I've used Skyscanner (app and website) to book all of my trips since 2012, but I can't stand the new app.. I don't even want to use it anymore. The old app was very simple and easy to use, this one is so cluttered and I can't find or figure out how to use the feature to find the cheapest month."
2016,1,"Used to be awesome and reliable, now it just doesn't work well at all.  Flight search turned up limited results on a busy route.  Double check it against airline website and app is only listing a few results and weird flight times.  Go to check and set filters.  It won't let me uncheck one stop and says there are no two stop flights, so can't uncheck that. Then results turn up a bunch of flights with two or more stops at weird times.  This is a route that major carriers have a flight almost every hour."
2016,1,Hey all! For those of you that like the way the app used to be just use the mobile site. It's got all the old and best features so you don't have to bother with the app! So 5 stars for that and 1 for this. And to the team at Skyscanner...please don't change that too!!
2016,1,"I hate this update. Used to be my favorite app. I could see the fare of any place, any date. Seeing the convenient price I planned my international trip before. Now it's totally useless. Time to uninstall."
2016,1,"Version before new one was much easier, much better, quicker and understandable.  It was my favourite searching flights. Don't need any hotels and car rentals search(it over flooded everywhere).How to downgrade for previous? Thanks."
2016,1,I love the old version very simple and fast. This new version it become another search engine for travel. To do that I go to a computer. Don't need this on my phone. Searching for another app. Like the old one
2016,2,"The useful widget to monitor the prices doesn't work anymore on this version. When I try to set it, I see the message ""Application not installed"". I use Android 5.0.1 on Samsung S4. PLEASE FIX IT!"
2016,1,This app was so useful to me a year ago when I was teaveling. It was so easy to figure out my next destination. Now it's impossible to find the cheapest places to go. Looking at the calender to see which dates were the cheapest for a place ate gone. All utility of the app is gone. I'm on the lookout for a new app.
2016,2,Very very long time user of skyscanner. But no longer. User experience gone down hill and perfect example of 'if it ain't broken..don't try to fix it'. Installing Momondo.
2016,1,"4 stars for the old version. 1 star for the new version...not user friendly, doesn't make searches easy. Have stopped using the app and use the website when I have to."
2016,1,No longer be able to search freely. All search are now restricted to specific criteria and become irrelevant. Not sure what is the reason for this degraded update that worsen user experience. What a waste! Time to uninstall.
2016,4,With the latest updates and Bug fixes Skyscanner has become the greatest way to check airfares and Compare costs. And the links to other web sites to get tickets work great. The sort options are very helpful
2016,1,"I don't know what's going on with this app now. My friend and I logged in  and searched for identical flights at the same time, his iPhone app was giving him options to buy the same flight for ‚Ç¨691 where as my android app was quoting me ‚Ç¨787."
2016,2,"How do you erase watches? Changing dates on a specific watch does not stay changed, reverts back. Janky interface."
2016,1,"So disappointed, each upgrade they release is worst than the prior. This app has become useless with the pass of the time. It was one of my favorites, but not anymore."
2016,1,"Since the new layout, I don't use the app anymore! The app was once very easy to use n quick to use. This happens when you have developers who need to develop constantly. Don't try to fix what is not broken!!!  Please re design to the website layout!!!"
2016,3,"Using this app for reference. So far so good. Is there a way you can add ""multi city"" flight search as well?  Thanks"
2016,1,It used to be the best way to find flight and now you can't use the app. You can't seem to use it to find flights on the dates that you search for.  Bring back the old version.
2016,5,"Thank you for listening to the users, Skyscanner. The new design is much better, easier to navigate and is a joy to use. Great stuff!"
2016,2,Why remove the open search function this is now like any other flight app. Was better before. Disappointed. Will try something else
2016,3,"Great apps but price alert feature does not work, will revert to 5 stars when this feature have been fixed. Cheers!"
2016,1,This used to be my favorite app and I used it so regularly.But u guys have ruined it with this new upgrade! It doesn't have the flexibility like the old one and it actually doesn't return my cheapest options ! Will have to look for a new app now! Great job!
2016,5,Great app.  Saves you tons of money and very user friendly.  Shared it with all my friends and family.
2016,1,"What happened? This app used to be so much better... I liked it when it was flights-only, without photos and nonsense."
2016,5,Helped me save a lot of money in finding the best flights. Saves lot of time. Find deals in one place.
2016,5,I really love this app. It gathers everything for me in one app n i am great.b it's really cheap flights n im extra happy for that!!
2016,5,"Very user friendly & so useful to plan travels with flexibility of filters, to find availability, durations, connections & price comparisons."
2016,5,This application saved me 200 euro just for 1 trip. I don't know how much more can I recommend this app.
2016,1,Used to be a 5/5. Now it sux. Good going guys. Way to ruin it with unecessary updates.
2016,1,Before we could get each day flight charge. But in new updates we can get only one day fare
2016,3,Now I'm wondering what happened to the anywhere function. I don't like the way the app sets to default your last search; this is equally frustrating.
2016,2,Won't give the option of direct flights only.  Latest upgrade even worse than before.
2016,5,An easy to use app that I look at many times a week for good prices to my destinations of choice. Kudos!
2016,5,Very easy to use and I use it all the time! Extremely user friendly and helpful in booking cheap international travel
2016,1,"When I search from somewhere to EVERYWHERE on the app, can you list the results in the SAME way as you do on the desktop version and dispense with the ""recommendations"" results page nonsense and busy pictures?"
2016,2,Old vesion thousand times better!!!  It was easier to find good flights and fares....
2016,5,Helps me to find the cheapest rate.. Very useful.. Thank you Skyscanner..
2016,1,I totally agree with other reviewers this was  great app until the new look update - now it's just useless so it's got to go!!
2016,5,Best deals time and time again. Sometimes getting 2 one way tickets sometimes works out better
2016,1,It's useless for me. I always travel to multi cities but this app can't handle it. Useless.
2016,2,Does what it says but UI could use some work.  And missing some airports as well
2016,5,I have been using this for a while and skyscanner has never fail me. Perhaps let us see the flexible dates of 3 or 5 days before and after of our selected dates will be better (those some airline website)??
2016,4,"This appa so helpful, i use this app to make my travel itinerary, but for the ticket i would like to buy in the sales counters itself"
2016,5,The app is humanized in a lot many ways! I love the way the results load one by one! Minimalist and simple!
2016,5,Use it to get short and long term options on travel. Extremely useful.
2016,5,Gives various choices of flights making it easy to compare prices and flight times...
2016,5,Thank you for responding! I hope you will make it better.
2016,2,I like to see what type of aircraft I'm flying on! New app is awful.
2016,1,"Used to be very simple to search flights with different parameters, new upgrades have made it terrible to use, have to now use the desktop website"
2016,5,it lets you find your dream flight at the best price!
2016,5,In my opinion is the best app to find low price flights
2016,2,The best thing about skyscanner is the ability to search destinations everywhere. Why is this not an option in the app?!
2016,5,I'm saving so much money by ordering my own flights rather than waiting for my booking agent to reply and charge her commission
2016,5,It's very nice application to know time and price and cheapest of flight to any where
2016,1,This app lost all useful features with this update
2016,1,Can't view whole month and did not find direct flights!
2016,1,Crap. Search doesn't work. Going back to the website.
2016,4,"The application is good,  but I couldn't search for a multiple city trip"
2016,5,Excelent app! Best prices!!
2016,5,I don't install many apps on my phone but this is a must have.
2016,5,"Love the graph,  easy to useüëç been getting flight deals for years"
2016,4,Help me to find and compare the prices for every airline
2016,5,Really enjoy the good but find some of the ridiculous solutions fascinating
2016,5,"Skyscanner has been great, replied quick, and the app runs smooth."
2016,5,Only thing I found missing is the multi stop option for booking flights.
2016,5,"As a backpacker i always use this app for booking my flights and never regret , better than all ."
2016,5,O app j√° mostra o valor total com as taxas e √© muito f√°cil de utilizar.
2016,5,"App works perfectly, rating request was unobtrusive and well done"
2016,4,Nice but need multi city option
2016,3,Hoping for more info of places and what to do..
2016,5,Its the best app ever.I wish there a six star
2016,5,Nice tool for searching a flight
2016,5,Best prices and flights!
2016,1,Previously brilliant App ruined by latest update.
2016,5,"Friendly, easy to use, accessible and dependable!!"
2016,5,Saves time going to a whole lotta websites.
2016,1,"So so so so so rubbish, I can't even."
2016,4,I can't find multi city flights in app just in website only
2016,1,Back to the web version...
2016,5,Used it to book 4 flights so far
2016,5,"O melhor. Funcional e simples, o q se quer."
2016,3,I just come to use this app. Tq
2016,3,Why it is not possible to search for multicity flights in the app?
2016,2,Getting worse with each update

2016,1,I used to love this app but since few months it is being completely useless. Before it was simply showing the price beside each day and now you can only see the price range or the graph which is always bugged and won't update prices.
2016,1,"I have been using this app for a couple of years and stopped using it after a major overhaul several months ago as it's not user friendly anymore.  I do not want to pick dates...to only see the graph with the prices instead of having to deal with picking a date...just want to pick my departure city to everywhere, for whenever to find deals.  I can't even do that anymore so I simply stopped using the app.  Want the old app back if you want a five stars review again."
2016,3,"One thing I love about using Skyscanner when looking at flights and travel options is the Multi-city search, but this app doesn't have it. I find this an annoying inconvenience, because if I want to use this feature on my phone, I have go to Skyscanner via web browser. Apart from that the apps pretty good and easy enough to use."
2016,1,"Now I have to scroll through hundreds of random flights to try and find what I'm looking for, also the search box doesn't allow me to add new searches I can only look at old locations. Before I could add my departure airport and see flights grouped by country to check out where I can go and at what time of year the flights were cheapest. The old format was perfect."
2016,1,"The functionality on the old app was far superior. I used to use this all the time. Now I'll resort back to direct airline pages. Searching ""Everywhere"" was easier, picking the cheapest flights was easier, etc. Time for a competitor to dev an app like your last version..."
2016,1,"How do I turn off Top Flight Deals from showing when I search Everywhere for my destination? I know you guys need to generate money, but taking the best feature away isn't the way to do it. I used to love seeing a list of countries when I searched to travel Everywhere. Now I get thumbnails of random cites that I can't even filter or sort by country. How do I bring back the old layout for search results when searching for Everywhere as my destination? The list was much more useful."
2016,1,"Like other recent reviews, I'm highly disappointed that they messed with the best parts of this app!  No longer is it easy to find flights on a clexible schedule and forget about trying to find flights around flexible destinations anymore.  First downloaded this app a few years ago and used it regularily.  Now I am considering uninstalling."
2016,2,"Pretty frustrated...was watching 4 flights. Had price alert turned on. Didn't receive any alerts. Regularly opened watched flights list and prices weren't changing. Come to find out, I clicked on the flight I wanted to buy and it had gone up $70 in price. So yeah...not exactly helpful."
2016,1,"you have removed the monthly view option,which judging by the other reviews, and common sense, was the feature that your customers wanted.  also return flights are now limited to weekends, 3 to 5, or 5 to 7 days.  what if I want to go for more than a week? terrible upgrade to a once fine app"
2016,2,"I've noticed that you have removed a lot of airlines from the search engine criteria. Have you stopped collaboration with them? Ryanair, EasyJet, Monarch, Swiss Air are just a few no longer appearing on the list after the last update. The whole point of the application and what made you differ by miles from the other apps was due to the vast results produced by all the airlines included. Overall it is still a good search engine but extremely limited due to the above."
2016,1,"I LOVED this app. Now some of the functionality has been removed i.e I'd like to search for specific flights knowing the departure and arrival airport but want to search the whole month, this function can now only be done via web/mobile site. Really frustrating."
2016,3,"The quick search auto date selection can inadvertently select more preferable dates, changing your actual dates. You could find yourself booking a good deal at a completely inappropriate time. Secondly having to scrolldown past this continuously after selecting your criteria in first place is irritating."
2016,2,This app was famous because of its core functionalities like the month view graph or the more famous chart view tab. People simply had been using that to book their best flights in advance and now it's gone again. Shame!
2016,1,I am really sad and annoyed at the same time: you've just ruined one of the best and most useful apps ever!!! Compulsory log in??? What about the calendar choice with price day by day??? Green/yellow/red dot that's it... unbelievable... is there any way to revert to a previous version??? I am really not satisfied with this. It worked so nicely a couple years ago when I started using it... what a shame...
2016,3,"Can't express how bad the redesign is. Just a Kayak clone now. The older version allowed to search ""everywhere"" and to see a layout by month to see when the cheapest month to fly would be. I get it you want to be like Kayak, but don't. Be better."
2016,1,Latest version is bad. It doesn't work so good and It isn't as friendly as the oldest version. I used to love the app ! Now I'm preferring another apps for look for cheap flights
2017,3,Loved this app...  Until I could not find a flight my friends were taking that was almost $200 cheaper!  So definitely does not show all flights...  And because of that does not bring up the cheapest options.
2016,1,"It WAS fantastic before but not anymore. The whole month fare chart got removed and that you can only search date by date if you wanna compare prices, which makes it's so annoying!"
2017,3,"It was great. Could search the way I wanted, connections, flights, timing... now... it's too complicated and not user friendly anymore. I'm looking for another app option. Pity. :("
2016,2,The recent updates to this service have nearly completely striped away what most people thought this app was amazing for. Perhaps partly just an issue of accessibility but I thought it was much more simpler and user friendly before the changes.
2016,4,Update - after the recent updates it is more user friendly and much easier to use. Thankyou. Very good app.
2016,1,Im sorry but U messed it up with this new update..travel is my life and now I lost part of it! :'(
2016,3,"You shouldn't change the whole interface when you make an update for application! When I just get used to new one,you change it again..."
2016,3,Very good Idea. Good interface. But constantly has outdated pricing that leaded to a lot of canceled bookings and misleading low prices.
2016,1,Now far over complicated. Pictures make is less functional. Month view is a mess. App needs to rewind about a year.
2016,1,"Not easy to search and compare from anywhere anytime. Used to be a nice app, not now unfortunately.  Uninstall."
2016,2,"Good software,  however,  multicity flight search option in missing still‚Ä¶."
2016,1,It was working perfectly fine. As i updated it simply ridiculous now. Not working at all
2016,5,I really like this application. Thank you so much.
2016,1,Bring back the anywhere and get rid of the speed pictures. You guys really downgraded this app.
2016,1,"This app is absolutely, incredibly, upsettingly useless. How can you get something so wrong"
2016,4,The app itself is good. Would like to be able to add multiple destinations on the app like on the website.
2016,2,You are unable to filter prior to searching which means searches take longer and the results are full of spam.
2016,4,But there would be nice with a 7day wiggle room so its easier to find the cheapest flight
2017,2,"Os pre√ßos que eles anunciam s√£o falsos, quando vamos comprar √© um pre√ßo absurdo"
2016,4,Makes planning my holiday much easier.
2016,4,We can search one way or return flight but not multiple city.
2016,5,Sound good may be try for my traveling destination
2016,1,Month view gone. No more words required
2016,3,Easy to find and compare flights
2016,1,Can not book flights
2016,5,Help full.
2016,5,I use at all time for my flights
2016,5,It can compares to any websites in the world
2016,5,Saves time and money
2016,5,Really help to search
2016,5,The best app
2016,5,Just great
2017,5,Good
2016,5,Best
2016,5,Want the graph showing high to low prices month to month
2016,1,Ugly UI
2017,5,My go to flight app.
2016,2,new update sucks
2016,5,Sewer
2016,5,Fab
2016,5,ok
2016,2,"I use this app for long time, almost everyday. It was the best of its kind, but now it's almost unuseful. Especially if I want to check deals to everywhere or without specifying a date. I'm still using an older version of this app on another device and it works really great. If I don't find soon the same functionality in the new app, I'll probably uninstall it."
2016,2,"The new update may seem simpler, but its not. It took away the ability for a more thorough search. The app seems harder to navigate and rushes you to the flight options quickly instead of the tinkering the old app version used to allow. Get as close to the feel as the webpage. Trash this update and roll back out the old app. Do it before its too late. Ill reinstall once its fixed."
2016,1,I have always used this app and found it easy to navigate. No longer the case. As a visually impaired person I find the new version much less friendly and more difficult to navigate. No longer can you search flights between airports without a specific date which was useful if you didn't know what days flights to certain destinations where available.  Pressing the back button now takes you back to the home page instead of the previous screen. Bring it back as it was this is awful.
2016,2,"Used to love this app. Was the best on the market for searching for cheap flights, and giving me inspiration but it is just so difficult to work now,  all the best features seem to have been disabled or else they are hidden in obscure menus. If a new update is not released soon I will be uninstalling as it is just frustrating me more than helping me at this stage."
2016,1,"I've been religiously using Skyscanner for flight search and booking flights and it used to be such a breeze to do so until this new update. Its so frustrating to even do one-way flight search erghhhhh! Furthermore, weekend/3-5 days/5-7 days options are pretty useless esp when you lose the flexibilty of choosing longer or shorter period. Might just give this app a pass after using it for so many years to so many wonderful trips"
2016,3,"I used this app very frequently, but find the update frustrating. The pictures are crowding when doing a whole country search. Tapping on the chart icon does not give you a whole month search as suggested in the feedback (at least not when searching a region). What I would like is to use the app to answer queries such as: what is the cheapest flight to Italy in November from a given airport."
2016,1,What happened? The new app is absolutely horrible. It's confusing and not easy to follow. I am writing a book about travel and Skyscanner was my number 1 recommended search tool. Will have to reconsider now. Please bring back old functionality. Your app used to be a 5-star app!
2016,1,"What have you done, direct connection only option? Sadly lost its core values - too many photos - over complicated for a phone. Skyscanners needs to get back to basics. Also please conduct dry testing before going live as this is awful !"
2016,5,"A very user friendly app that provides great information on whatever you need to book your trip. Cool functionalities like price rise alert, search for the cheapest destination (for those who are not picky and just want to travel). Overall a very good app."
2016,3,1. I don't need pictures 2. to change dates is complicated 3. I dont want to rent a car or book a hotel.. .I have other apps for that. Aren't we already find out that we should focus on one thing and do it good than many and .. .
2016,1,The prices are very expensive when compared to when booking directly from airlines sites. I just booked a return flight Melbourne to Wellington and got hit by a $100 more fare price. Realised after purchase and too late to cancel. Sigh. Uninstalling the app. Nonsense.
2016,1,Decreased functionality again come on sky scanner you have removed tge functionality that made your app great. Please get it sorted or I will have to uninstall app. Guys its obvious from the reviews and previous attempts to change this is not what your customers want so why are you doing it? The  only people that would seem to benefit from this change are the airlines????
2016,1,"I choose a few flights to track. Yesterday I got a nonsensical notification that there was an $80 flight (which doesn't exist, especially among the flights I chose). This morning I checked the prices and the flights dropped to $236 (down $30) and no notification. Don't bother with this."
2016,1,"In persuit of renovation and multiple functionality, Skyscanner became user UNfriendly and in fact lost some very useful functions for the initial service of flight search (i.e. filter your search). It is very-very disappointing and frustrating, I miss the simple and handy old version."
2016,1,Please revert to the old format ...not I just get a random list of 10 indian cities with many other places not listed or overplayed prices which make no sense. It used to be such a brilliant app. Can't use it anymore
2016,1,"The new design of the app is very confusing. Plus half the time now the app does not show any prices or flights. I had used this app all the time, now I have switched back to Kayak. Fix your app or keep losing customers"
2016,2,As much as I used to love this app I kinda started to dislike it. My main problem is that it's giving me 3 options for the trip length but not letting me choose other options without having to choose exact dates. Please change this!
2016,1,"Used to be the best app. Now it's slow and for some reason sometimes doesn't show any flights when actually there are plenty to show. Honestly guys, suicide is never an option."
2016,1,"All the good features have been removed.  Reply is untrue. There is no period search, only fixed date search. I have uninstalled this app and will not reinstall it until the original features are replaced."
2016,5,"Skyscanner is my preferred app for flights. I stopped using the other companies (Kayak, etc.) because this one was just too good. It gives me the most options and flexibility in my searches, and it's got a great UI that's pleasing to use."
2016,4,"I have used this app for a while now and it is great. Easy to use and navigate. If I could suggest one thing, can a multi-trip option be added? I have used this option on the website but it would be great for the app."
2016,1,"Doesn't even have as much functionality as their mobile website. No ability to search for multi-stop flights, only one-way and return. Useless."
2016,2,"This app used to be 5 star, I used it almost daily to daydream or plan future trips - now you can't even do a basic filter on direct flights only! I don't understand why they would take something so user friendly and intuitive and go backwards like this?!"
2016,1,This use to be a fantastic app. This has now been updated and is totally unusable. I try to do basic searches and this is both confusing and frustrating. The straight forward interface has been replaced with a flashy and confusing layout. Please look into this!!!
2016,3,5 stars for the old classic version.  1 star for the new version where it tells you in squares where u can go..  Prices aren't always accurate and not sorted by price
2016,1,How can I get an old version of this app? I used to use it all of the time but now it is so difficult to use. The website has a fantastic system for searching but this new app has either removed or hidden all that was good about it.
2016,1,does not display best prices over overtime anymore. i updated just now and couldn't stop it. i want to be able to see when it's cheapest for me to go somewhere not just what the best price is for the dates i selected.
2016,5,Had never heard of this app until I saw Jen's replies on Twitter. Just tried it out and this is pretty amazing! Great interface it's like the only travel app you'll ever need.
2016,3,Flight booking app functionality?  In this updated app it seems as if I can no longer search for the cheapest days in a month? Or search for cheapest flights 2 or 3 days either side of the preferred  flight date?  Or maybe this is hidden in obscure menus?  Disappointed!
2016,1,"Old app was way better and allowed me to pick the cheapest dates of travel new app compketely sucks and is a nightmare to use,lost a user ,used to love this app but again another company ruining a perfect app I wouldn't even give it 1 star will never use again"
2016,2,"Picture thumbs are not effective, ruined a perfect app, now i have to use your website or another flight comparing app, please put graph/calender view back in app. Was 5*"
2016,1,"The only characteristic the made this app unique was the option of comparing different prices based on the day of the selected month. This very useful feature has been removed in the last update, very unimpressed."
2016,5,"When I heard about this app, I got excited, got it and couldn't help searching it all the time. I'm looking forward to making one of these trips soon. Thanks sky scanner!"
2016,4,good App that makes searching for flights across the Web really easy and organizes them in a user friendly interface. the sort and filters aren't as logical as other apps but overall the app has a good layout and capabilities
2016,1,"New version has lost the search flexibility.  Please, please, please bring back the search criteria and the slidey bar graph thingy.  I often choose from UK to everywhere on any day in any month...  Where is it?"
2016,1,This USED to be a good app/website. Now has too many scam partners and refuse to help you in getting refunds/changes when people are scammed. Book directly with the airlines
2016,5,"Hands down the only place you need to check to buy a ticket anywhere, anyhow. I'm a full time, budget conscious world traveller who often books flights at the last moment- this app is one of the most important in my phone"
2016,1,"This recent update is worse than the previously terrible version, harder to use and navigate around.                      Stop over complicating things, it's SKYscanner, not flights hotels and car scanner....."
2016,5,"Really enjoying the app. Great filters. Great flow for searching flights and car hire. Haven't tried the hotel side yet, but I am really excited about it."
2016,5,"In short,  the best travel app. I bought an Android phone just to enjoy this app. Unfortunately it is not available on windows phones, hopefully they pay attention to Windows users a.s.a.p."
2016,4,I liked when the app had a list of the cheapest countries in order. The update now is ok but the older version was better. The new style gets a four. Old version was a 5 .
2016,5,This app has flexibility unlike any other. I get daily notifications of what prices are going to look like over a span of dates that I can be ok with. That's impressive.
2016,1,The latest update means you can search but the app won't display any flight results. Some serious bugs that need to be fixed
2016,1,"When searching for flights comes up with very cheap deals on ""lol.travel"" but when you click on it it is nearly triple the price everytime. Please fix this"
2016,4,"The app is great,  but I really don't like the ad. Can you add a in app purchase to remove the ad as you did in iOS version, thanks."
2016,4,"Finding cheapest flight to travel easily. At first, although it kinna hard to use this app, but its ok i guess.&lt;(‚ÄæÔ∏∂‚Äæ)&gt;"
2016,5,I only use this app for flights because I'm able to discover the least expensive days to fly by manipulating the arrival/departure time frames. I've saved thousands of dollars this way!
2016,2,The change in interface in the latest update is very confusing when trying to find deals to multiple destinations. Revert to before the update! So annoying!
2016,5,Currently the goto app for price comparisons. Let's hope they keep it honest & aren't seduced by the quick buck.
2016,5,"After wasting hours looking at other sites that said they looked at multiple Airlines and found dead the cheapest flights, this one actually does! Kudos!"
2016,5,"This app provides a more convenient interface of the web version, letting the user find great deals easily. The filters are incredibly useful too."
2016,5,Always use this. Always seems find find easy and best routes. Sometimes will find alternate routes tht other combining sites miss
2016,5,Been bitten by the travel bug since 2013..I find this app really useful to search and book flights within a backpacker's budget..üòâ..
2016,4,"Alerts for fare changes is the best part of this app. One suggestion: please add settings to get alerts on a time period basis, i.e. alerts for fares during a week."
2016,5,It's great app but need more price range and direct flight options more flight around the world and hotel section we need apartment as well for month stays  thank you
2016,4,Past tense. Pretty good now but was way better with the old format of a chart showing individual prices for days
2016,1,"The new version is really complicated and the additional step to choose among flight, hotel and car rental is hassling."
2016,1,Dear Skyscanner team there is no any option for multi city on Skyscanner app on Android n ios i.e i want to go first karachi to Istanbul than london this option is available on website but not in app kindly help
2016,5,"This is my favorite app for finding the best flyts! I do not have to much time to search, but this app makes it so easy to find exactly what you need."
2016,1,"Please, please can we have the old one back! I used it all the time. It was brilliant. Can't use this."
2016,1,Today this app just showed up on phone.   Deleting.  No nothing about it.
2016,5,Filter cold be saved for each search individually. Price alert could work for selected flights.
2016,4,It's really helpfull me to search international flight ticket.. and i can calculate how much i need..
2016,5,The only logical search for flights when you don't care from where or can't choose where to go. Brilliant thanks
2016,5,"probably one of the easiest, no-nonsense apps for travel. no confusion whatsoever"
2016,4,Great app so far. Seems to be accurate when I compare the prices

2016,5,Fabulous app. Gives list of airline and prices just like stock market.
2016,5,Fant√°stica aplicaci√≥n porque te da la opci√≥n de ver destinos de un pa√≠s a otro. Te da todas las opciones de aeropuertos y te muestra las compa√±√≠as a√©reas. Fant√°stica idea

2016,5,For an older version
2016,5,1ST TIMER
2016,1,"I'm going to try and download the update... but am still gutted they decided to ruin a great App. After updating I have not been able to use the this app. It's UI is so NOT user friendly! I'm only going to try this update out because let's face it, it can't get any worse. I had to forcibly download the newer version of the app because all the apps off my phone were deleted.... yes just tried it out and I am now deleting this App."
2016,1,"This app was an amazing app that allowed you to look into the future and find nuggets, amazing deals and really separate itself from Expedia or Travelocity because it was unique in its search feature. But with this newest update it has completely ruined the gem that it was, it has become nothing more than your average travel app now... if they dont restore the search feature it use to have.. I will go back to google flights..."
2016,1,"Hate this new update! I used to be able to see all the cheapest international flights in a list, and now it's gone! I loved being able to plan trips to other countries and seeing the best deals, and now the feature is gone! I will wait till the next update before I delete to see if the best features of this app, the whole reason i used this app and recommended it to others, come back."
2016,4,"It's getting better compared to last update. At least the developer responds. Graph option is top right corner on select a date (mini tutorial would be cool to have to show changes, I thought the graph was gone still). More one-way options would be nice, or multiple departure days, rather than re-searching each day. I like the rating system, good to know... Keep it up, will be back at it as top travel search app..."
2016,2,"I personally don't like the new interface at all. It used to be so much better. I have bought so many tickets to places I didn't think about based on where and when to go, and let Skyscanner offer me options. Now has totally changed. Nothing special from any other app. Maybe the only interesting addition is the deals option, but not as easy to use as it used to be. Sorry, but if you don't bring back the classic option, I am out"
2016,1,"Nope. I thought you guys were going to revert bacj but no. Still sucks. I want the old app that you would show cheapest flight from everywhere, and then shows the price range for the span of 6 months, and then show it in graph how it would fare everyday. Just like before. Its the only reason i buy tickets even when i dont consider buying. It used to be so simple, so great. What happened? You guys change programmer or something? The old one WAS PERFECTION. No other app is better than that one!"
2016,1,"Do NOT use this App. Use the website on your mobile as it provides classic filters.  App has lost its special feature of being able to view the price of flights on the graph/chart. I will keep the app until the next update. Maybe get a new development team as clearly they have broken an app that did not need fixing? Why fix/update an App that was fulfilling its service? User Friendliness 5, APP Features 1, Development Team 0. Bring back classic features such as filter by flight time just like mobile website"
2016,2,UPDATE - I uploaded the app again since I saw the response to my review. I still can't do what I want. I used to be able to pick a departure airport and choose a destination and could find the cheapest dates to travel between the two destinations. I don't see where I can do this anymore. It forces me to enter specific dates now. I miss this feature and will look for another app that does this.
2016,1,"This app used to be amazing, you could search flights easily and amend your search filters. You could see a month worth of flights to choose the best option for you. They have clearly tried to make the app more aesthetically pleasing but lost the user friendliness of the app. Why fix what was working fine? I will be using a different app for searching for low cost flights, in the mean time I hope the developers fix their app..."
2016,1,"Was 5 stars, now 1 star. Unless I cannot see it but where are the options to apply certain dates? If it is there somewhere the UI has become crap. Yes the minimal GUI's for those on low data plans (you would get more visitors, big hint) but I feel standards have dropped. Sorry SkyScanner programmer (wo)man, I know you can do better! How do I go back a version please?"
2016,1,"This app used to be my go to for all family holidays. It's now so bad I have to look elsewhere for lowest prices. It used to have all deals but now only has base fares (no deals). The search everywhere only brings up a few flights and these are not places I want to go or have ever searched. If it continues like this, I will have to delete the app!!!"
2016,1,"Searching used to have heaps of flexibility. Edited my feedback from 5 stars (previously highly impressed) to 2 stars, now to 1 star due to many of the bkg agents listed here undercut ticket prices direct from the airlines, making it more expensive for your average traveller. And then when you go through the whole process of entering your credit card details and purchasing tickets, there is no garantee that those tickets were even available. A typical greedy set up of mostly 'middle men' taking a fee."
2016,1,"I used to have this app in the past and it WAS good. I just installed it on my new phone and the experience is very disappointing indeed. The great feature that made this app so good,  the graphical flight prices over the month is gone. Maybe now it's just a commercial app paid for by airline advertising money? How else could it go from best to worse? I would rate it zero stars if I could."
2016,1,"This was an excellent app, very functional allowing whole month searches and letting you refine results down by country. All gone in the recent updates, replaced with useless pictures meaning you have to scroll and scroll to get anywhere. Now it's only usable if you have a fixed destination in mind, as ""Everywhere"" search results mean you have to scroll through every domestic combination first, pages and pages of results you don't want to see - bring back country-led results for ""everywhere"" searches."
2016,2,"I can search the cheapest flights across the whole month! Awesome app, I'll be saving so much money now. Thanks!  Edit (1/9/16): App has gotten confusing and less organised in recent update. Much harder to find a good flight. Overall experience is much worse than before. Probably not worth downloading any now."
2016,1,"This app used to be great. The new update has removed simple list and search features and replaced them with pretty pictures. 'Top picks' don't reflect my top picks and every time I open the app now, it's stuck on a search I did once ages ago rather than my home airport like it used to."
2016,1,"Old interface and app were superb.Now uninstalling.  Update. You don't seem to understand the majority of one star ratings, do you? Bring back the old version, this ""TopDeals"" pushing has nothing to do with what the app is supposed to do. Besides, the monthly chart is nowhere to be found, nothing in the top right corner."
2016,2,"The old version was so simple and easy to use. This one seems to be more ""modern"" but it has to many problems. Sometimes I can not see the price day by day in a whole month and in the older version was really useful the option everywhere because you could see the countries with the cheapest flights prices"
2016,1,We need back previous version as it were predicting rates month and dates wise... secondly please dont follow make mytrip prices as i found last month wrong prediction offering 5100rs ccu to dxb. Thats a false.  This is cheat company.
2016,2,"I gave this app 5 stars 2 yrs ago.I dont understand the need to constantly change apps.It was fine the way it was. As soon as you make yourself familiar with a change, along comes another update to annoy and confuse. I will be using something else until you come to your senses..."
2016,3,"I want to avoid booking the wrong airline when the airline has a codeshare. Can be very confusing, previously it has the 'operated by' detail for flights. Otherwise good app but pls make it simple to use,not too many update that it has become an inconvenience."
2016,1,"This used be one of the best, clear, fast and easy to use. Now I honestly can't work out how to use it. Just tried to get a price on a one-way flight - seems impossible. Please revert to the old version it was great."
2016,2,"Generically boring app.. Slowly losing its appeal as it would few years back. We love simpleness but now,  complicated mehh. Will hold on until 2 updates."
2016,1,"Used this app a long time to search for flights and the best time to book. Now you've gone and ruined it, won't be using again until it's fixed! Please fix it soon, I loved it with the future prices!"
2016,1,"Just installed the update, very bad user interface design none of the easy functions available. No simple way to select direct flights. Developers need to listen and revert to the old interface."
2016,4,It's able to help find the right flight I need. Only part that confuses me is the date. I'm not sure what timezone the flight will follow... is it my timezone or the country where I will arrive and depart from?
2016,2,"By default, the app set a fixed period.  If you want to change the dates, it will take a while to work it out. I would like something easier and more user friendly."
2016,3,Good for finding flights but I've never been able to go all the way thru with a booking. I have had to go to an airport airline desk or by the time you click on it the offer is gone or not valid. Good for flight information tho.
2016,3,"Why change such a good app? You can find what you need now, but is hard to remember where to find the graphs.  Still use the old version on my other device."
2016,1,I used to really love this  app and recommended it to everyone.  Since the change and amalgamation of flights and hotels it is awful.  I will be using a different app in the  future but really hope this can be reverted back to the original and best....  Please please please!
2016,5,"Bringing back your old options makes this App very useful again. Thx for listening to the users. Maybe instead of adding some stuff at random in the future, send a survey? I'm sure that quite a few travellers have some ideas what to add. I would like multi-stop,  or some sort of circle where starting and finishing point is the same, you choose how many stops you would like over what time..."
2016,1,"Been using Scanner App for a few years and now changing to something else. Too many prompts to log in, don't want to book holidays or cars only flights - clues in the title skyscanner!"
2016,2,The whole of month feature is why o used SkyScanner over other booking companies. You can still do it on the desktop app but it'd be good to see on mobile. I'm sure it used to be?!
2016,4,"App is very nice and easy to use. Though i found one problem. When u select the destination then it will propose some dates automatically. But there is no way to select new dates. I have to select the proposed date and then on the next screen, i need to edit the change."
2016,1,Used to love this app. They seem to have missed the ball. Used to be able to see monthly flights with the cost. Now? Where is it gone. Ah well it was good while it lasted.
2016,1,"Very frustrated with he new version, can't compare prices on different days as easily, generic searches don't bring up cheap flights, you have to put multiple specific searches in, massive pain, no longer using."
2016,1,Where can I manage Single / Return flights? Where can I manage the desired flight date? Sorry but the new update is a mess... :-( Why change it when the old one was easy and straight forward...?
2016,1,Was a lot better when you could the  find. The cheapest flight by the month and not by date can you add this thanks for fast reply still like to see all price shown on graff table
2016,1,I can't find flights easily. The old version of this app was more useful than the new version. I used to like the old one. Please check it and renew.
2016,5,Much cleaner than the web-based version. Extremely pleased. Great job!! Sept 3 2016 update: I have used this app in so many corners of the world and still works great!
2016,2,"The app stopped letting you search open dates, or specific dates at all. You MUST choose a specific set, like a week one or two weeks out. Pretty much makes it useless"
2016,2,Since the update the features I liked that no other app seemed to have have disappeared. Back to the browser or someone else's app for now. No longer special üòï
2016,5,Gets best deals and with price alerts you can track prices up and down. Recommend to everyone I know. Love it and saves stacks of time.
2016,1,Update is a disaster. Happily used Skyscanner for 2 years. Been struggling with update but giving up. Dreadful. Will look for an alternative app.
2016,3,The old skyscanner apps seems much more focus on the flight search and the interface seems better especially the month view graph which used to be clearer and easy to identify cheaper fare.
2016,1,Used to be a great app could see all prices for month ahead and book flights based on this.The old version was class. Seriously bring back the old App.
2016,5,Thank you developers.. Appreciate it to the core and keep up this awesome app for travelers... it's our life saver
2016,2,The updated app is difficult to use. Used to be much better. Easier to compare flights over a whole month and to select direct flights only.
2016,4,Top Flight Deals show prices which cannot be found when one opens the list of flights. I'm still using it allways when planning a new trip.
2016,1,This was a 5 star app with a perfect search function but this new update is clumsy and poorly thought out. Please bring back the previous version of this app.
2016,1,"This app has become a real dog. I'm sure there is a way to select dates, but I can't find it. It used to be so intuitive."
2016,1,New version is not very intuitive. Used to love the previous version. Also gives me constantly a connection error.
2016,4,Good app or website to find cheap good flights. Organized and clean interface. Works for me.
2016,5,"I think this GUI is better than the desktop version, especially as it remembers different trips to the same destination. Love the Happiness rating too üòä"
2016,5,The app. seems to be very user friendly & it does exactly 'what it says on the box'. The ability to sort by time of flight is also very useful.
2016,1,Updates during last year have ruined the app. Slow and annoying. Switching to Kayak.
2016,1,Has been gone and sincerely I don't understand why???? How can you destroy on purpose such a great tool. It's really sad!!!!!!.
2016,4,Since desktops time I always used skyscanner to find cheapest flights. This apps make it lots easier now!
2016,5,"Loved this app since I started using it!  As a student abroad I love the ""everywhere"" feature when looking for the cheapest flights!"
2016,1,You updated the app again and it's the same problem as last time. You can't change destination and search properly. Please fix
2016,5,Great app. Give you every deal from all sites and including almost all of the airlines. Nice work
2016,5,"Well, they fixed every single thing that I was disappointed that they had changed and they actually made it easier to read! Amazing! Skyscanner is #1 in my list again!"
2016,1,New update has ruined the usefulness and handiness of choosing a flight based on ones budget  rather than a specific date
2016,5,Love this app. It's easy to use and the alert lets me get the flights I want at great prices
2016,4,"Never used this app before, but missing the multi search flight option. Had a reply from the developers, they're working on it."
2016,3,Before i could search from a destination to anywhere with any dates not anymore now i have to put dates in. I just want to see if there is any great deals i could take advantage of im not searching for somwthing in particular but now i cant just do that its crap compared to before
2016,1,This new version has destroyed the app. What were they thinking putting out a half baked app!?
2016,1,"This app used to be amazing why have they changed it, I will use something better now. Bring Back the old clean search with monthly search etc"
2017,1,Love the site but app has half its features. Can't do multi and single way???
2016,5,"Thank you so much for providing such a useful tool, in such an easy to use and manageable interface."
2016,5,"I have tried other similar apps and ended up uninstalling them. Now, I only use this application for   information on available flights and pricing."
2016,4,Gives you great price ranges depending on your preferentes. Quick searches and constantly updated.
2016,5,Easy to use. Much easier to find best prices from one site that searches best rates for you!
2016,2,Disappointed that the option for bieng able to view monthly has gone. Was so much easier. Why ruin a good thing
2016,1,"Why keep changing something what was good, you make it worse every time, you can't even search dates anymore !! What a pile of garbage"
2016,5,The new app is visually amazing and still very user friendly. Love using it!
2016,5,I saved 400 dollars by finding a flight that my travel agent couldn't find using this app.
2016,5,"Clean UI, offers lots of savings, and never crashes! I love this app."
2016,5,Only missing multi trip price watch but works great for everything else
2016,1,Latest update has ruined it. Dont think it shows some airlines as well
2016,5,Full service covering all airlines that you find some really good deals with:)
2016,5,Love this app. Always gives me the best prices and so easy to use.
2016,1,I dont like this app now! I prefer how it was before!! Thanks
2016,4,Nice app that you get cheap flight rate information ...
2016,4,"Forget the title,  i been using it for a while,  just felt like reviewing it now after seeing jen on twitter.   Cheers!"
2016,1,Bring back simple and clear version! Why make it complicated?
2016,1,There was nothing wrong with the app so why change it? Please change it back to the old interface.
2016,3,"Preferred the old design & focus on flights. The new app home page is annoying , should default to flights."
2016,1,This new update is no good. Want the old one back
2016,4,"App is good but v limited options, happy feeling but not great kinda... Not v much Indian but yeah v good"
2016,4,Useful and Cleer.  Be good if you could save personal settings and destinations and some kind of alert functionality would be great
2016,5,Accurate and tight database of airports. Fast search. Great app!
2016,4,Very good experience. Excellent prices with continuous tracking of the prices
2016,5,Really good for finding the best options and prices! Good filters too
2016,4,It is a great tool to find low prices on time.
2016,1,"no way to customize the time range, makes it completely useless, I'd rather go to the airline company to search one by one"
2016,4,This app doesnt have a feature to search multiple cities flight.
2016,3,Gimme back the old version. It was way better.
2016,5,Great app. Very quick. The Currency selection option is very handy.
2016,1,Things should improve...not getting worse...I cannot believe how bad it is now this app....Im unistalling it...that s how bad it is
2016,1,"Used to be an excellent app, they should have left it alone. Please put it back how it was."
2016,1,Hate the new interface. Before was much more useful
2016,5,Love the deals. Easy to use. Simple.
2016,3,The app is giving a different rate from the main website. Its better to use the site using a laptop or desktop
2016,5,Let's you see all available flights with prices!
2016,5,"Fast, eficiente and user friendly. I love it"
2016,1,Take an app that was quite good and make it terrible to use. Well done skyscanner
2016,4,"I like this application so easily and have a very good follow up, till date I recommended it to my friends"
2016,5,Has a great UI and gets some of the best prices.
2016,5,I can't wait to travel at the cheapest prices!
2016,4,"Great apps, easy to use, accurate price, but could be better by adding ""Multiple City"" in the apps as in the web."
2016,1,Why is this once brilliant app so bloody hard to use now!? Rubbish!!
2016,4,Giving it a 4 star because I want to be able to choose the cheapest months and do multicity search in the app
2016,5,Simple and least disturbing. Tracks the flight costs well.
2016,5,Very good gets all flights with best prices
2016,5,Great searxher. Best prices always
2016,4,The app is great but it doesn't have the multi city option

2016,4,"I still use this app all the time, but it is now far less user friendly since the update. The ""explore top deals"" function with tile format is useless to me, the flight search function should be where that is. That said, the monthly price views for flights to a certain destination are still excellent.  I have saved a lot of money with Skyscanner. I hope developers are taking these comments on board and make a change. Multi city search like Kayak does would also be nice."
2016,3,"New version extremely unintuitive. Also missing is the ability to select ""anytime"" which limits casual searching for flights. Entire month missing in parts. Also, on the widget I tapped the ¬£17 to Germany result and it searched for deals and returned 3. Cheapest was a ¬£23 return to Bremen leaving and returning the same day(!!!) and the others were over ¬£1200. No option to change any options post search. Useless. Still doesn't deserve the 1* reviews from the over reactionary crowd tho"
2016,1,"Primary features that made this service useful for planning random trips to anywhere have been removed. No more globe or ""united States to anywhere outside us"" filter to ensure I can skip all the continental flights. No more""all months"" filter either. This app went from indispensable to useless.  Edit: not even labels for what country the cities are in! You have to scroll around like a fool and do a google search. Go back to the column view and nested folder structure. No more gaudy tourist agency photos."
2016,1,"This was a really useful app, very quick and intuitive to use with an easy to understand graphic representation of the flights available and their cost. What on earth happened. Bring back the original and call it the classic version as a separate app and very few will download this thing. Development is supposed to be about making things better. I really hate this text based, click here to find out a little more approach. Bring back the good working graphs they made it better than similar apps."
2016,1,Skyscanner has always been quite a consistant trustworthy app but they dropped the ball with this last update. Many small things not working like they used to. Hopefully they fix it soon. Update 13th August...yes the one way everywhere flights have been completely ruined. My most used app feature üòï Don't fix what isn't broken App team. I'd pay to go back to the old graph version üòïüòïüòï
2016,1,"Used to be so easy to search for flights but now they have made it so difficult and I can't even work out how you search for a single flight anymore. Looks like it's time for a change. Update 11th August 2016, yet again they have messed with the app and rendered it completely useless if you want to to search for flights. I do not understand the need to mess with the app and make it completely useless."
2016,1,I used to love this app but it has been ruined. It's so messy and hard to use. Before I used to use the 'everywhere' feature and it would give me a list of the cheapest countries I could travel too. Now it comes up with random destinations in a tile format which is so hard to understand and dosent display what I want. I just want to know the cheapest country I can fly too. Please bring this back!
2016,1,"Upgraded my mobile and downloaded this app as I've always used it to book flights before. For whatever reason the app is now completely changed with much of the previous functionality  (filtering departure and arrival times, airlines etc) has now gone leaving a bare app much the same as any travel app out there. Pity it's now useless to me and I'm deleting it :-("
2016,1,"I liked the old version with graphs and a heck of a lot destinations in the everywhere option. It was quick and easy to look up cheapest destinations around the globe. Also the option to show cheapest flight dates was very good, I could plan my holiday around them. The essence of the app has been lost somewhat in the sense that people want it to find cheapest flights easily to any destination with any dates and have a browse at random flights to entice them to plan their next holiday as well."
2016,2,There seems to be no correlation between the advertised price and the actual price... To be fair to skyscanner the mobile optimised site is still very good but it's very irritating to spend time searching flights only to find out the prices are not accurate. ..unlike the mos which is accurate and also still user friendly in terms of functionality...I don't think it should take much to retweak the app to sort these issues out...could be a PHP issue?
2016,1,"I've never written any review but this is so bad I had to. New layout makes it impossible to select whole year to browse at leisure, results display make it hard to browse destination by country, then see detail by city, app keeps asking for location, all in all app has lost all interesting features that made it different from any other. I am terribly disappointed and see no purpose to this app anymore."
2016,2,"Any way I can go back to an older version where there were graphs and I could look for one way flights to ""everywhere""? And also i used to be able to check which day would be the cheapest. There were so many ways to search for great deals. Now I'm just getting random results, it looks like. No idea how to use this app anymore. It worked super well last year. Now it doesn't even seem like the same app, any recommendations of which app I can use now?"
2016,1,"What was once the go to app for searching for flights is now almost unusable. I'm not sure how such an intuitive app has been ruined to this degree. I understand why you're trying to sell people the ""top deals"", but the app is now left lacking the charm it has previously. I'll probably try something else now."
2016,3,"5 stars for the concept/service, 1 Star for the current app version. The whole top deals thing is really annoying and its hard to search for a simple flight now. I jump onto the website now or even get on bravofly or something because it's too annoying now"
2016,2,"I used to love the Skyscanner app. Now it's extremely frustrating to use. Trying to search flying from tehran to turkey, one way, and it automatically puts in a 7 day return date. New interface is messy and difficult to use.  The graphs were the best part of the skyscanner app. Very disappointed."
2016,1,From what used to be my go to app to check for prices I now can't even get flights up with the horrible and needless new updates. Selected dates don't show any flights and there is no flexibility to finding flights within a set period or the app finding the cheapest prices in that set period of dates. Please undo the changes.
2016,1,"Used to use this all the time for searching for flights. Since they updated it though, it's virtually useless. Can't search for one way flights, no more anytime anywhere search, and more other helpful stuff gone. Not happy! Needs fixing asap!!"
2016,1,Have you sent this out to a pilot group for review? Have you sent this out to your internal colleagues and requested feedback? This is disastrous and I'm quite sure you're going to lose an awful lot of business because of it. Revert back so I can enjoy a simplistic view to booking flights.
2016,2,There should be a basic feature to filter airlines before search or save it in setting. The results shown without this feature can never be accurate. Because the low cost airlines may have cheaper airfare on one day whereas full service may have it on some other day. So the calendar then is of no use.
2016,5,I initially became disillusioned very quickly and uninstalled it. Later I kept being referred to its website for tweaked options which did not exist in apps. Learned that I did not know how to tweak searches in this app. My bad. Landed 27% saving by adding 2 more hours of flight time with a younger higher quality airline. Saved me roadtrips with newer ideas and deals. Travel good. Learning it still. :)
2016,3,Skyscanner website when it first started used to be able to perform just a regular return fare check. It has now include a multi-city option which is very convenient for frequent traveler like me. Unfortunately the Skyscanner app still lacks this function. Zuji has it. Multi-city booking is increasing getting popular nowadays. Please consider having this function included in your next release.
2016,1,Still can't search a whole month for the cheapest deal from a specific airport to everywhere. What's the point of the app if to search for cheap deals abroad you have to go onto the website. I want to be able to highlight the month of August like before not tediously go date by date airport by airport
2016,1,"I used to love this app. The app is basically garbage now. For example, why must results show up as ""tiles"" now? I used to be able to quickly scan through different countries easily. Now when searching from an airport to ""everywhere"" why do I have to see every city in the US listed and then have to try and find a city in another country randomly interspersed in between?! If you insist on displaying results this way, at least sort the tiles by country so we can quickly select a country of interest."
2016,1,"It used to be an excellemt app, but with each recent update the app functionality has been reduced. Not much flexibility in searching is left, and nothing functions properly. The screen space is all taken with ads. Shame. Time to migrate to a different travel app."
2016,1,"I used to absolutely love this app but I just cannot stand the updated version. It's not as easy to use and I find most of the new features completely useless and unnecessary. If you haven't already, DO NOT UPDATE."
2016,1,"Best deals? I just want to see flights I asked for, look for best dates and book. Was fine before, needed some update but not a whole change! Delete! Using holiday pirates one now"
2016,2,I can't search the period of time (one way) and the airport at the first page. I will have to click the recommended period of time then change the date and airport I want. It's a bit trouble. I prefer the old version.
2016,3,The original version used to allow viewing of 1-3 months graphs showing price differences. Now you have to search each date separately. It would be a 5 star app if that option came back!
2016,1,"Latest update is simply horrible. Doesn't give you as many options as before and it doesn't even work well on a mobile. Really hard to work with now, it was much before until some time ago."
2016,1,"Desde las √∫ltimas actualizaciones es imposible buscar los vuelos como antes, ahora te salen solo ida y vuelta aunque no quieras la vuelta. Te tienes que ir a la p√°gina web para poder buscar de forma decente con el engorro que conlleva. Espero que lo arreglen y lo pongan como antes."
2016,2,"New update makes it shoddy and hard to use. Don't download the latest version. Now too focused on 'top deals' we don't want to see that, hence why we're using what I would now refer to as Skyscammer."
2016,3,"It doesnt remember the time filter for departure times or airlines filter when creating an alarm...i keep getting notifications for flights I know I cant/wont take. Also, on the website, it should allow me to get the visual monthly chart with my filters as well"
2016,1,"Yes I understand cards look pretty but I much preferred the old info dense list views that highlighted which countries I could get to in any date range than this. This no longer helps me find figure out ""where to next"""
2016,2,"I use to love this app, and recommended it to my friends, family members, and colleagues. Now, I despise it, because it use to be so much more efficient and user friendly. Please, app designers fix what you messed up!"
2016,1,"What on earth happened?  This used to be great and with every update it gets worse!! Turn the clocks back a year when it was worth having. Absolutely useless now unless you know exact dates,and even then its complicated at best!!!!"
2016,1,"I don't get why u guys changed it. One of the best feature u had was the ability to find the cheapest flight from a country to everywhere. U don't get the option of checking which month is   the cheapest to go no more, u have to check it month by month. I'm about to uninstall the app."
2016,1,"Usually i don't rate apps but this time i have to do it. This is the worst update i have seen ever!! Old version was good, it was easy to search, please reroll update"
2016,2,"Clumsy interface, poor results being returned. Why did you have to change it? Tiled results are terrible. You have ruined this app and I like many others are really disappointed."
2016,5,I use this app. I have just recently started flying between South Carolina and Seattle not business just leisurely visiting between my grandkids. This app helps me find the cheapest flights with the best service. Thank you to the creators of this app!!!
2016,2,It was an amazing app before the update. I could search every where and anytime. I can find cheapest flight and make my plans accordingly. Please some how add those options back somehow. It was a great app and I recommended to every one.
2016,1,"Used to rely heavily on skyscanner when booking flights, new version makes it pretty much much useless and non functional in my eyes. Previously recommended to everyone, will be quite the opposite going forward."
2016,1,"Hate the new results, especially the Everywhere search results. Can't you just sort me by country and lower price and not show prices that were updated ""8 days ago"" ? PURE CRAP"
2016,1,"Why fix something that wasn't broken? It was a great app, i loved the search to ""everywhere"" to choose destinations. Now useless interface and disappointment :(((( Please return old functionality and interface!!!)))))"
2016,3,"Useful app but its changed alot and doesn't save the last search. After their major update, it's never been the same."
2016,1,Searching for a one way flight to everywhere with entire month selected as the date is not possible anymore after update. This change has led me to search for another flight  booking app.
2016,4,"Love this. Use it frequently for keeping check on prices for flights. Never had any technical issues, which is rare. üòÜ"
2016,2,Every time I pit to search flight it goes to top deals its so frustrating.. Can you guys put the graph back please .
2016,4,OK so you can search for everywhere from the intro screen to find the best deals. A bit more cluttered than it used to be but still pretty good.
2016,1,Used to be my go to app for searching for flights but the update has removed all the features that were great about it. Have downloaded Momondo and will be using that from now on.
2016,5,"Love the way it saves my searches. For example, if I search for a ticket to Atlanta on 3 different sets of dates because I'm trying to find the cheapest dates, it saves all 3 of the date combinations. When I go back a few days later to look again, I don't have to put in all of the dates."
2016,1,Hate this app now. Bring back the old one fast or you'll lose 80% of your customers.
2016,5,A really good app that helps you look for cheap flights especially when you are looking for flights in advance. Notifies you when there is a cheap deal. Worth 5 stars. üëèüëè
2016,1,Used to be all about functionality but now it's all about pictures and other non-sense this recent update has made me so angry to use an app in which I always used to travel nearly 33 countries.
2016,1,"I haven't used SkyScanner for several months.. I don't know what you guys tried to accomplish with the new format, but it's a significant step backwards!"
2016,1,"Just make it like the website, we love the website. It's over complicated, where's the flexibile search, the cheapest month option? Why does the search come by city and not country?"
2016,4,Is it safe to book flights using this app? is the baggage allowance still the same? no hidden costs and additional charges compared when booking online with the airlines website? can anybody give me a feedback please?
2016,4,Great app that is very easy to use. It would be perfect if it had functionality for planning multi-city flights.
2016,2,"What have you done to this app!?! Extremely un-user friendly now, worked great before, will be deleting if not changed üôÅ"
2016,2,Used to consider this a 5 star app but recent updates have made this almost unusable. Please return to the old interface.
2016,1,"One way doesn't always work, functionality lost, too advert looking, flexibility lost.  Bring back the old version"
2016,5,Look no other. Skyscanner is everything you need to save flight deals both local and international. Thank you Skyscanner!
2016,1,Was way better before update. Am a travel professional and used the app daily. Now it will be deleted.
2016,1,"Fix up, go back to old version, the tile view is useless, show me price by. Country"
2016,1,"This updated version is terrible. There is no way to search for a one way flight, it always defaults to a 7 day return flight regardless."
2016,5,I love how user friendly the app is. It's absolutely the easiest way to book flights and find the best deals!
2016,4,"with the last update its more difficult  for me to find best prices for future months, without a diagrama it was 1 month ago"
2016,5,Every time I want to fly I've used Skyscanner. Always the best deals and super easy to use!
2016,1,no graphs.  hard to use. i'd rather check prices on individual airline websites
2016,1,Doesn't allow me to select one way flights. Lags and is slow. Awful app.
2016,5,Guys this app is actually the best app to book cheap flights. I tried alot of apps and this one is definetly the best.
2016,1,Priceline lies about their prices they show you on thing and once your getting the deal the prices change completely
2016,1,Why did you go and ruin a perfectly good app. Roll back to the previous version
2016,4,Nice app. I like it. it shows all flights
2016,1,"It cracks and freezes. The 1st version was nice, much better."
2016,1,Can't I pay with my master card on this site? Because  I am afraid i don't want to be fraud.
2016,1,Getting worse after update i cant find option to select one way flight.
2016,1,Any way to go back to old version this update ruined a good app
2016,1,"Going to find a different app now, the functionality that made it great has been removed for the sake of selling package deals"
2016,5,Lets me find flights and hotels easily on my mobile.
2016,1,Unfortunately the feature SELECT ALL MONTH disappeared when you set up an itinerary between two cities.
2016,5,App works great and can find the cheapest flight easily..
2016,1,Awful update. Please bring back the classic version.
2016,1,Latest update is  sucks. I cant filter by date easily
2016,3,I hope you place a flight comparison chart for each month so I'd easily know when to go
2018,2,"So bad you  can't search by open dates, something that I really liked about this app"
2016,5,Membantu arrange flight dengan info harga termurah
2016,4,It's a great app but compared to the web version the multiple cities option is missing.
2016,4,"Please try to make it more simple, easy and add multi city options for flight booking"
2016,1,"Every search is Top deals, totally ignored my criteria"
2016,5,Great app thank god for this service!
2018,5,Great app! The best for flights!
2016,4,Simple and quick comparing of flights and easy to book tickets.
2016,2,Much more difficult and confusing to use since it has changed.Uninstalling
2016,5,Give a lot information for the updated ticket price
2016,5,Good ap. I like putting in a destination an being notified about pricing
2016,5,When I'm bored my plan is visit this app and finding out my where is going to be my next trip
2016,5,Always use this app to get the best flight deals.
2016,5,"Best flight search app, includes more airlines than others"
2016,5,"Very good app and time saving, can be used for flight comparison"
2016,5,"Basically a meta search of all booking sites, all in one."

2016,1,"You have NOW ruined the app in its entirety, at least on the android version. It is simply worthless. You added the ""everywhere"" option again, great! But trying to find a ONE WAY flight to another country takes centuries as now I have to go thru dozens and dozens of city names with pics until I see something interesting from a different country. Those times of trying to find a cheap ticket to an another country as an adventure, are long gone. Today, is my last day of using this app. After 5 long years."
2016,1,"The latest version has removed or changed some of the best features that this app had. I've been using it for at least 2 years now, and recommended it to lots of people, but after this update I don't think I will be using or recommending it anymore. Gotta start searching for a new one I guess. Really a shame."
2016,1,"This app was originally successful due to its simplicity and quick functionality. Now, with all the stock photos and clutter, it is just another travel/brochure app. I know where I want to go, I don't need to see pictures. I just need quick lists of my options. Oh dear. I will have to find another app. Perhaps I'll try Kayak or whatever. Angry."
2016,1,"I just want to search a cheap flight from point A to point B (point B being anywhere), one way. The app always searches for return flights for random amount of days, and a different month to what I'm searching for. The app was fine about 2 years ago. Fair enough keep updating it, but it's just getting worse and worse and worse. It's just...really, really bad. Sorry."
2016,1,"Why remove functionality?  It appears to no longer be possible to search flights from a specific location to Everywhere on a specific date. Instead I get ""Top Deals"" for a whole month, and not the month I searched on.  You just can't stop fidling with yourselves can you. Looking for a better alternative now, this app has had its day."
2016,1,I use to enjoy using this app to look for flights. If I pick where I want to go and the dates I want do give me your BS package deals that I'm not looking for it I would have searched for them. If it's not broke don't fix it. I think to many developers think they need to tinker and change things to often.
2016,1,"Why change something that was working really well? The latest update is too busy, not very clear or easy to follow! Dates keep flicking back and cities reverting after I change them! All I want is to be able to input a destination and dates!  I've booked pretty much every flight by going through this app in the past and now I'm actually searching the playstore for an alternative!"
2016,1,This used to be my favourite app. Pick a destination and look across a whole year for the best deals and then book. Now it's like all the other crap travel apps that force you to enter when you want to travel. Why break something that work's! So disappointing!
2016,1,"Before this update this app was amazing, right now instead it sucks a lot. I used skyscanner for looking for flights, not for hotels or car rentals. After the update the app is awful: you have time till next summer to fix it back or you ll loose me for sure."
2016,1,"The chart and the everywhere option is gone! You cannot even choose a country destination, only cities. For what reason to use this app and not any other from the dozens out there?!?! Total disaster!    EDIT: Latest update still problematic, no ""anytime"" option and ""everywhere"" option just brings up with random useless ""deals"", nowhere near the functionality of the initial versions... Uninstall and wait for a new update."
2016,2,This used to be my favourite app for just seeing where I could go cheap and when. So many holidays planned around cheap flights thanks to this app. But then they ruined it. Bring back the simplicity and allow to see a list of flights to everywhere at any time so I can start planning again
2016,3,"Some good ideas, but obvious things are missing. For example - give me updates only on destinations outside the US, or only in South America, or only in SE Asia. Allow more flexible date ranges. Have a direct feedback to the developers, as opposed to having to give a review shortly before uninstalling the app."
2016,2,"This used to be a wonderful app, I could search for flights to a specific region or country and didn't have to enter dates. Now, I have to scroll through a long list of cities to try and find any fare deals. It's really disappointing"
2016,3,"Updated: they did add back the ""everywhere"" search option, but when they pull up the results it's like Google flights... which I don't find to be useful at all. The list I feel was easier to navigate. I guess this looks prettier, but the list was more useful in my opinion"
2016,1,Please return to old version.  This one is the worst app now. Going from best to worst took some doing but you have managed it. Deleted app from phone on till fixed. Would recommend everyone to do the same.
2016,5,Been into serious travel excess 40 years as mega indipendant globetrotter.  The more research i can do the better. Sky scanner provides much needed & vital travel info in my ever expanding online must have library. Would not leave home without it. Gets my vote every time. Do yourself a mega favour & get it asap.
2016,1,I cant use this after an update.  Its a horrible unintuitive mess.  Trying to look up flight for two and an infant and i cant find anywhere how to change the options like before.  Probably has it but i cant be bothered to read the code just to do it
2016,1,"How you manage to single-handedly destroy a perfectly good app in one update is beyond me. This is a strange, cluttered, unintuitive mess. It took me a good 5 minutes to find a one way search option. So bad."
2016,1,The app is very similar to many of the other flight apps.  It was unique and excellent before the update.  Backpackers loved it now not so much.  Now the one-ways and anywhere searches are difficult
2016,2,Before the recent updates I could search flights during an entire month. Now I need to search on specific dates which is really inconvenient. In addition to that the overview is very chaotic and somewhat unclear. I hope they bring the month-search function back.
2016,1,"Bring back the old app I used it everyday. This updated vision is terrible very poor searching for flights everywhere!! used to bring where flights go, prices now is deals on certain dates rubbish"
2016,1,"Search without date and pick the cheapest flights, via nice graph gone...what made you different from others is gone. Usability got much worse in many aspects."
2016,1,"I did repeated searches for a flight next year... prices suddenly rose by 50%. Booked on laptop at the lower, original price, later that day. Dodgy!"
2016,1,"I'm sorry to say, I hate the changes you've made. Skyscanner used to be how I planned all my vacations but ever since you removed the ""Anytime"" option and made it so we have to scroll through all US destinations city-by-city before getting to anything international, this app has become pretty much worthless to me."
2016,1,Arrrggh I hate the new updates. Please do us all a favor and bring back the old Skyscanner. You've destroyed a perfectly good app when you did this update.
2016,5,I use this app all the time and it's the best out there. Don't waste your time with those dumb features. This app finds you the best flights at the lowest rate in half the time period.
2016,3,"Before it was simple to search for a one way flight at some point in the future, now whenever I search a flight I end up with return results. The search flow is also much more confusing :("
2016,1,I loved it first but after new update it's useless! Loved the first version nice and easy to use and very clear. This one gives me a headache
2016,4,Although i loved the previous versions of the app. I welcome the new changes to the app too. But please bring the nearby airport and add multicity options to flights search.
2016,1,Why can't I search and see a bar graph for chepeast flights any longer?! Absolutely destroyed my favourite app with this latest update.
2016,1,As other users have said. What the hell did you do that for? Yes the pictures look okay but user experience is most important. Please change back to the version we all loved..
2016,1,"This app looks like it was done by a 9 year old. Why make these changes. Totally ruined a great app , to find flights."
2016,1,"Since I've updated this app, my phone just freezes and I have to take the battery out in order to start using it again! !! I'm uninstaling it hoping that you will solve the problem."
2016,5,Best app to find cheap flight tickets. Graph shows low fare days and months. Loved it..üëå‚úåüëç
2016,1,"There's an old saying in the UK, ""if it's not broke don't fix it"". Quite simply you have ruined a very good app. I'm having to search through the main desktop site as this is a jumbled mess."
2016,1,Used to be an excellent app to find cheap flights. Now it's worthless. Worse now than any other flight app. Too bad.
2016,5,Good apps for traveller. But personally I prefer previous version. Cause you may just key in everywhere and the apps will find the flight to the whole world .
2016,5,I've used this app fifteen times over the last two years. Always my go to for the best price. Guaranteed!
2016,5,"Was once a great app... Now it's quite useless on this config. No excuses about ART etc pls, I'm sure it's some simple fix from the app's part even if it might be considered a ""workaround"". Why am I saying this? Other apps (some are a hundred times more complex) are running fine. ART isn't disappointing me otherwise."
2016,5,"Great app, really helpful,  love how easy is to get around and find the best flights at the best prices!!! Amazing job... keep it up :)"
2016,5,"I like the new logo. Simple and minimal. Reminds me of SoundCloud a bit. Anyway, I like the app. Gets me better deals everytime"
2016,1,"Previous version much easier to navigate. I don't need images, bring back the lists. Not good SS!!"
2016,1,"Changed it again!!  It was great,  then updated and was bad.  Then it was good again but now another horrible update."
2016,1,I don't know what the developers were thinking but as you you surely already know you've removed the best features with the update. Don't be surprised when stats move negatively.
2016,1,This used to be the best app for finding cheap flights. Where can you check for the cheapest flight? Now using CheapFilghts.
2016,4,Its really amazing app.. I frequently checks the flights n rate.. The cheapest one I got it from it.
2016,2,"I love the older version, I am not able search for one way flight with this updated version. Can it be fixed?"
2016,4,I loved it ....as it covers not only airline websites but also third party ticketing websites as well in one click.....before this app I was having hard time swinging between different websites for price quotes but here everything is displayed in one platform.....kudos
2016,1,After update  i can't find anything. Please bring back the old search. Still useless  after 1.8.2016 update.
2016,5,Amazing app for flight bookings... seriously loved it ! Cheapest prices compare to all webites n travel agencies
2016,2,New update is bad - used to have a clear list of flights; now an awkward list of 'squares' with pictures - not intuitive.
2016,1,Please being back list View and fix that Bug that prevents you from searching for whole month. And fire the person in charge for the design. U made it worse!!!!!!
2016,1,It was a much simpler and easier to use now  it is just useless. On android can't seem to be able to see one way deals
2016,5,An amazing app. Just need to book 28days before... to get good price. Keep improving...
2016,5,"I really like this app.  Option to ""anywhere"" is the best thing ever on travel apps.  Kudos."
2016,1,"After using sky scanner for ten years and being a huge advocate for it the new app is so terrible that I was left totally frustrated. Sad, sad day, goodbye sky scanner."
2016,1,Latest version doesn't seem to allow for a search of a full year at once. Back to the website I guess..
2016,5,I like the email alerts when the price decreases . App definitely works in your favorite when you're trying to get best deals
2016,5,"Great app for looking at flights,  loads of info that seem unbeatable.  Easy to use,  love it"
2016,1,this upgrade when i serch for flights keeps switching to deals    ended up using the old version still on my tablet
2016,4,"Great, but as a Scottish company I'm sure you could see the benefit of being able to split 'UK' into its constituents, would be a much appreciated feature, and I'm guessing not a difficult one to add"
2016,3,"Guys please, u add a lot of functions, but the main one whe you see calendar with dates in red yellow and green colors to find cheaper date are gone please add it back, hope for response, like this program"
2016,2,"Why can't I search for flights within the month / year? And why can't I sort destinations (when using ""Everywhere"" as a destination) by price (ascending)?"
2016,5,"New UI is absolutely a treat to use . Very clean interface, crystal clear flight details and great to use"
2016,1,Too difficult to navigate and find the best flights. The old version or website are much better.
2016,1,"I have it one star to steer people away. The more people know about it, the quicker the deals will end"
2016,5,This is really good to find all flights with cheapest rate.. and its so simple to use..
2016,5,Simply compare the market for flights. Excellent. Nice design to.
2016,5,Great app. So useful especially the price alert üëç. Highly recommended.
2016,1,Before new design it was the best. Now it looks horrible. Please go back to old design.
2016,1,What happened Skyscanner? I really hope you guys fix this horrible update soon!!
2016,5,"If you are planning a trip and you want the best deal, this app does all of the work for you."
2016,1,Goodbye SkyScanner. Thanks for ruining a once wonderful app.
2016,1,Only one destination makes this app not usable. Please allow multi city as per website
2016,1,The first time it was easy to use but after remembering my preferences it's impossible to find new serch.
2016,2,After the latest update it is just a terrible app. I want the previous version back!!!
2016,2,It's still not better coz as travelling we always search different airport but still in we can't change the departure airport so it's really suck
2016,1,Please please go back to previous app. Recent update is in no way an improvement.
2016,5,It's good thanks  booked my Dubai trip through it.
2016,1,Ruined best search app out there ..quite  simple..go back to old version..if it isn't broke don't fix it..
2016,5,Love the UI. It is easy to search and the price alerts are exactly what I was looking for.
2016,5,This app it's a great tool that help me travel with a tight budget.
2016,1,Use to love using this app. Upgrade just doesn't search for what I ask it to.
2016,4,"I book most of my tickets via skyscanner !....Amazing fares ,great app ! A must have for eaCh phone"
2016,4,I'm rating 4 stars on the quality of the pervious version. The latest version doesn't seem to work at all on my S7
2016,4,"Good app , getting rates from max. Sites online so getting the cheapest fligts"
2016,1,You could not of done a worse job updating your app it was so great before now it is totally useless
2016,5,My 1st Stop for flights and loving the layout of the new version
2016,4,Is OK but I remember it used to be easier to compare different prices in different dates with a graf they used to have
2016,3,Good app but it should show calender fare that would be more useful.
2016,5,Use it often then Google flights then final bookings.
2016,5,Should offer hotel + flight combos
2016,5,Excellent app..love it. Keep up the good work!
2016,4,"Not quite sure yet but give it time, I just downloaded it üòä"
2016,4,"Can't seem to search for full month anymore, otherwise good"
2016,3,So far okay. Easy and fast booking.
2016,4,It gives quick results and tells me what is the best price
2016,1,It was really good app but now is useless!
2016,1,Not easy to use.. liked the website better
2016,3,Can't seem to search for multiple city? I'll stick to the site.
2016,5,"The UK to everywhere search is simply my favourite, so many options!"
2016,5,It would be great to have an ability to reorder watched flights and see the weekdays of dates.
2016,5,"Design is simple,but It has every useful function,information."
2016,5,Very easy to use app that displays the most convenient options for any need
2016,4,"Easy to use, very clear!"
2016,5,"The best app, cheapest tickets ever!"
2016,5,I have taste many app travel and this is the best one.
2016,5,Nice. I can find cheaper airplane cost here
2016,5,Really easy to use and a great way to find cheap flights
2016,5,Up there in the top! Saving you money
2016,5,"Very useful, substitutes travel agencies üòÜ"
2016,5,Easy to use and set up notices for better deals.
2016,5,Have always got the best deals from Sky Scanner
2016,5,Gives so many alternatives and cheaper...
2016,5,It is very helpful App. I like it:)
2016,5,This one is very useful & easy to use.
2016,5,Such a great app to have so convenient

2017,5,HiFi
2016,5,Super util
2016,5,I have been using this app from long and it's been my favorite always
2016,5,Good one..
2016,1,"App is great but recently a company has appeared offering really low prices on searches, which are nowhere to be seen when trying to buy. 'Air express' they call themselves now but they have several names. Needs looking into :)"
2016,1,The new update make it impossible to find the best prices and destinations
2016,5,Best app for booking flights. One of the best comparisons!
2016,1,"This was one of mine favorite apps ever...till the last update. It is confusing, terible navigation and not user friendly. It will be uninstaled if something is not changed. Lot of previous features are now unavailable, like searching flights everywhere. Maybe it is there but you simply can't find it. Terible, terible update. You made one hell of a app totaly useless and complicated."
2016,1,"I used to love the charts and everywhere feature - now it only shows me set dates and obscure European cities. I've booked many flights through this app but now the search is useless!                                     EDIT - thanks for your reply Skyscanner, but my problem is that the ""everywhere"" feature doesn't show everywhere anymore - it doesn't even feature most countries anymore. Also I still can't find the chart feature even when looking for it, the calendar option has no visible chart button."
2016,1,"This app used to be unique and allowed for flexibility.  The update has made this app worse.  I loved the Everywhere option but it is only on Top Deals now.  The top deals option is useless as it is filled with deals to US - I would rather skip over US as a whole.  Navigation is also difficult since the update, and it basically does what any other flight/hotel searching app out there does - it is nothing special anymore.  I'll wait for next update, if the old features aren't restored, I'll have to delete."
2016,1,"Now cannot search for one way flights (which is vital for someone on a round the world trip) and the ""everywhere"" search is now far less functional. The ""top deals"" search is all that remains, and it clunky and hard to use. Edit: When I open the app from my home screen, the quick search option is not present on the initial page but when I open the webpage via a Google search, the app that opens has a quick search function. Not sure how it could be that two versions of the app seem to be running on my phone."
2016,1,"The new update has turned Skyscanner into just another travel app.  The keystone feature: the option to see a list of cheapest flights from a given airport sorted by destination country, has been removed in favour of a difficult to navigate splash-screen of so-called ""top deals"". Skyscanner has scored me some awesome flight deals in the past, but the way it's set up now, I would never have been able to access them."
2016,1,"I used to recommend this app to everyone. The latest update has taken away the best and unique features. Because of my location I am flexible with the airports I travel from, with the new update I cannot  select flights from my whole country meaning I now have to run a number of searches. Also the search for flights ""everywhere"" now seems hidden and reduced. Also as it is now not sorted by country it also means you have a lot more go sieve through. I will stop using this app if it does not improve"
2016,1,"UPDATE: app completely overdeveloped!  The images are pretty, smh but take to long to load and kill mobile functionality. Bless those who pay for data-this is not the app for you.  Two of the ways I could tweak one way searches are gone! The solid share of 'traveler' market is sacrificed to another tourist app.  Boooo skyscannerüò¢ why?---(old)  This used to be my goto on the road, in a pinch, small drag on data, sweet, smooth ui. Not anymore...Better was the enemy of good enough. recommend ita matrix app."
2016,2,"The features of being able to pick everywhere or to everywhere else, or to be able to pick the whole country rather than cities etc are gone. Its like the intentionally wanted to screw their app. Please bring the features back. The older interface was more intuitive. They were the prime things why we had this app on our phone. I'd give a better rating only if I can have them back."
2016,1,"Can i buy the source code for the older version because seriously this app sucks now. You guys got rid of the filters and many features in the new design. Big mistake, your just inviting competition now, id hate to see you guys dissappear expecially because ive booked 2 flights with your app previously. Look CEO to CEO, just re-release this build as SS2 (Skyscanner 2) and roll back the old version. Its worse than I thought. Were going to need a public apology these reviews are tragic."
2016,1,"Loved this app and used it to find and book flights. Now it doesn't have any of the features for which I had loved it. Here's what I want: I'm in Europe and I want to travel in the next 6 months. Don't know where, don't know when. I want to say I'm leaving from airport X. Where is the cheapest to fly? When is the best time? New update won't even tell me which destinations are available from my chosen airport. Please go back, or at least add the options back."
2016,2,"This new update made app totaly useless. Not possible to search flights from destination to everywhere sorted by countries, compared by lowest price. Not possible to compare one way flights, instead of this great features app show totaly unreasonable offers of any unsorted flights to destinations. App lost its functionality, now it is only one of another unusable flights search app with no reason to be installed on my phone. PLEASE GIVE US BACK OLD GOOD SKYSCANNER"
2016,1,"The latest changes have made the app unusable for anyone who just fancies seeing what the prices are worldwide from a particular airport/country in a particular month. The ""everywhere"" option is present in Top Deals but with significantly reduced functionality where it only shows prices for a particular date of its choosing rather than allowing the user to browse all prices for that route. Unless you are using the app to search for a specific flight on a specific date, it is basically useless."
2016,1,"Used to love this app. I'm travelling and it's been great for finding locations to go to next. The new interface is more complex, has got rid of the 'everywhere' option and it just seems like a massive step backwards. I've been using skyscanner for over 12 years, and it was the 'everywhere' option that kept me coming back, but I'll be looking for alternatives now."
2016,1,"The perk of this app was to be able to launch broad searches for flights in terms of destinations and date range (e.g.: Montreal to Everywhere; August 2016) and look at all the possibilities.   Now,  it's just like any other travel app.  You are restricted to a very precise search.  It used to be so useful. Uninstalling it."
2016,1,"This update has ruined what was by far the best part of the app - everywhere search. Now you have to go through skyscanner's recommended deals, which is just filled with close locations and is not grouped by country (and it seems you can't do everywhere search for one way flights?). Add everywhere search back to the normal flight search -&gt; group by country -&gt; then group by airport. For now I am uninstalling the app and I'm amazed at how shortsighted the recent updates have been"
2016,1,"This used to be my favourite travel app. Pick a departure airport, select destination everywhere, see what came up, scroll the calender for suitable dates, boom. That feature has now gone and it's now a convoluted mess with the changes made not adding value. Real shame."
2016,1,"Skyscanner, take on board what others are saying! The app is now unusable. Can't search one-way flights or search for flights going ""everywhere"". If you're saying this IS possible, then let me (and several hundred others) make this absolutely crystal clear for you; your app is no longer intuitive. Stop arguing the point and amend ASAP."
2016,2,"For the love of God the new layout is worthless. I'm sick of having to press the back and next buttons a thousand times to change one little thing.  Skyscanner is already for smart travelers. We are exploring a hundred options at once. I used to be able to do that. I have to use the website now because the app is for grandparents and people who can barely use orbitz.       Update..... What happened to the ""everywhere"" option in the destination? That was literally the only thing you had better than kayak"
2016,1,"This used to be the best app.... Now gone. The update is a disaster. What's bugging me is that you give the same answer to everyone. Just admit it is a wrong update and make a statement about it. Not just say the same useless phrase. And you say that the one-way search is to be found in the chart interface, on a circle? Which circle? There is no circle. You ruined all those country to country searches. App gone really bad!"
2016,1,"Can't search from the UK any more, has to be a specific airport. Also the monthly searches aren't there where it lists the flight costs for every month. The new way of searching also only offers up to 5-7 day trips. What if I want to go for longer? Please please restore to how it used to be"
2016,1,"I don't need or want your deals for cheap trips. There are a hundred other apps that do that. Your app WAS great because it gave me freedom of choice in picking a cheap destination and then the cheapest days. If I lose this, I will probably not use this app anymore, which is unfortunate because that will severely affect my travel abilities. Give me back the Everywhere option and the bar graph to pick cheap dates. And that ""Everywhere"" function in the deals is not the same. Don't pretend it is."
2016,1,"Dear developers team, I have been using this awesome app for many years. But now its almost impossible to find cheap tickets --- where is the month search and how to choose a country instead of city or airport? --- Where is the ability to search tickets for ""everywhere"" destination? You are the best, guys, please bring listed features back!"
2016,1,"Where is the good old monthly prices overview gone?? Awful new navigation and suddenly bad overview of good deals for trips longer than 1 week üò° will wait for next update but if it doesnt improve must delete it. Shame, was my favorite flight engine before update which ruined it.."
2016,2,"Once we set the price alerts, this app gives proper timely alerts on changes in price if any.. Problem is when there is low price change alerts then we immediately go and do the search.. Buy no flights are shown at that low price.. It shows with high prices only.. Then not sure why do we set alerts if this is the behaviour."
2016,1,"This app used to be great, but the latest update has completely killed it. Firstly, the search ""Everywhere"" option  has vanished. Secondly, you now have flights, hotels and car hire...how about you get the flights sorted first and then worry about the rest? Thirdly, it's now a cluttered mess. Get in the bin"
2016,1,"I just find it useless, in the previous version  you were able to see the average price per month, so it was easy to book a date...now you have to choose an specific date...and algo the interface is not friendly. I have read many other reviews and the support replays, and the problem is the same...and the same answer, but the point is that is not a nice app anymore"
2016,2,"I used to love this app because it was so flexible, you could see where was cheapest to fly to from any UK airport. The latest update forces you to select outgoing and destination cities. Skyscanner was unique because it allowed really open searches, please change it back to the way it was!!"
2016,3,"Following Skyscanner's reply;  Yes there is some similar functionality but the new app has lost the intuitive interface from the earlier version, or indeed the current website version. Skyscanner needs to read the comments preceding mine! Install the previous interface quickly!!"
2016,1,"Had this on my old phone and seem to remember it was great.  Thought I could easily add filters for nearby airports, both departure and arrival, move a little slider for departure and arrival times, and, choose direct or 1 stop etc. It was hugely customisable but I can't even use it now for anything other than a simple search."
2016,1,Why the changes?!? What made this app great was the ability to not have to enter specific locations. I am a very flexible traveller and loved the ability to enter just a country to fly out of and look for the cheapest places to go next. I do not want to have to enter a specific city. Please add this option back!
2016,1,"What an absolute mess you've made of my favourite app. Too much hard work now,, i'll be looking elsewhere. For quick search you can't get all flights from UK. I still haven't  worked out how to search one way flights either."
2016,1,"I preferred the old version so much clear and better so I uninstalled this version and use the old one.  Every new version worst...  Can believe it.  So difficult to use by searching ""whole month""  like before.  As usual.  I uninstall new version and stay I  the old one..."
2016,1,"it was great last week but then you changed it and rather than improving it its now less useful - the best thing about it, and what  made it unique, was the ability to do wide ranging searches like searching flights by country now its way more time consuming to go  airport by airport and makes it just like all the others. its a shame you don't appear to be taking any notice of the many reviews that preferred it the way it was and would have probably raved about it and recommended it to friends"
2016,1,"Can't select a country as a whole anymore in 'departure' whilst searching for flights, nor can you select 'everywhere' anymore or have one month selected as your preferred departure time with another month selected as your preferred time to come back. Basically, it's incredibly unusable and has lost its user friendliness."
2016,1,The app says reflects all taxes and fees till you go to book your flight and bam more hidden fees very disappointed. The new face lift has ruin this app if it's not broke don't mess with it such a pity.
2016,1,"Big dislike since the last update. Before I used Skyscanner a lot. Now it's not possible to find the best prices within short time, everything has become more complicated. I will delete it, it's not useful anymore."
2016,1,I told you several months ago you had ruined a perfect app now it has got even worse!!  Where has the everywhere UK to anywhere  in the world functionality gone?? Some of us like a random trip so compare prices to multiple destinations
2016,1,This service no longer gives updated information on flights. Every time you think you've found a deal it no longer exists. Often the data is about 1 day old. I'm moving back to Kayak. At least they give you honest prices.
2016,1,I've been using Sky scanner more than 5yrs now. And now I'm thinking to find another app. Cause new update version sucks!!! Very very disappointed almost heart breaking. This turns absolutely hopeless and useless.
2016,5,"It remembers my filters and it has  price alert notification. It also has  lowest price estimate per  month, which is easy to notice because it is color coded. With over 10 million downloads for this app, one can never go wrong. One should look no more. This app is very, very good!"
2016,1,Dislike very much the updated app.. The previous one was much better easier and clearer to use                          i read no-one likes the updated app...Just go back to the previous version.. Which was far easier and better!
2016,1,The good old days of searching every country in the world for a flight any time of the year are apparently gone. As it stands there's absolutely no reason not to use the mobile website insead.  This update better be reverted soon.
2016,2,The new update has made me less likely to use the app. In the past I have recommended Skyscanner because I could see the average prices per month and the different prices per day. That is no longer a part of the app I have loved. I am uninstalling.
2016,1,"Latest update is rubbish!! Data is not displayed very clearly and I cannot search single tickets from my airport to everywhere! This app was one of my favourites for years, but I now find it very disappointing...  Please do something!!"
2016,1,It's now impossible to search for the best flights. Unable to search for everywhere flights. Keeps coming up with tragic recommendations which you have no way of knowing if the best deal. Total crap! Need to find an alternative. Where is the everywhere function??????
2016,2,I used to love skyscanner app. Fan completely devoted to it but guys what you did with the last update? It's just terrible. I hope it's just for me or you are going to lose a lot of fans.
2016,1,Web site design is good.  But android  app not much.. Please update like Web application as same to Android..  With multiple city's searching options. Thanks
2016,1,This new update is really not a good decision. This apps is not user friendly anymore and I can't find features to choose cheapest month after the latest update. I really love to use the old one more than this latest update. Hopefully you can consider to get the old one back.
2016,4,"Couldn't find deals for larger duration... Also top deals are given for  journey in the same month, which is not much useful. I would like to plan journey as per the travel budget, no such options found."
2016,1,"What have you done to this app. Honestly used to be a must have app. Now it's impossible to use, buggy, confusing, and misleading with prices, such a shame. Go back to your basics guys."
2016,1,"Can only search to ""everywhere"" in ""Explore top deals"" no longer able to do so in flight section. Being able to search for a flight to everywhere/anywhere is the main reason I use skyscanner. Please fix ASAP!"
2016,2,I've opted for the desktop version and Google flights. I really tried with the app update! But time is everything as I am traveling. I find myself scrolling through a lot of info that is irrelevant to me before I find what I need.
2016,2,It used to be great but the latest update is just bad. I want to put LAX and it does not even.show up. I tried typing Los Angeles and it's not there. Are you kidding?
2016,2,With the newest version I can't search ' anywhere'  and also there is more changes done to worse...  I Miss the old good simple  versions.  This is BS.  I'm looking for a new app.  Bye bye Skyscanner
2016,1,....but felt the need here... what have you done to the app? Generic simple open search by either country/ city/ one way / round trip/ flexible date range is the idea of using a flight scanner...now your just ryanair in a different colour... change it back please
2016,1,"This app used to be the best, now it is impossible to use even for just basic stuff. The user interface is so complicated to use now... Just bring back the old version."
2016,1,The best thing about this app was that I could just select my airport and it would show me the cheapest flights to anywhere in the world. That was how I planned my vacations. Its gone now. Want the old version back.
2016,1,The new update turned Skyscanner to useless app.  It lost the main features for County search all over the mo ths to get cheapest month.  I will uninstall it if no update to recover that feature
2016,3,"The app sucks now, cos ya catered to all the stupid people of the world by douching up the interface. Thanks for the desktop version though, it's a work of art and I use it all the time."
2016,5,The app makes the life of heavy traveler like me much easier. It helps me to find always the best offer for flight. The interface of the app is also cute and user friendly... love it!
2016,1,I used to use this for easy and quick way to search for flights but the new update makes it frustrating and impossible to use. A once awesome app turned awful. Its disappointing
2016,1,It's completely different and unusable. I can't even search flights to / from whole countries to find the cheapest flight or search for the whole month. I'll stop using it now.
2016,1,It makes me pick a place to see the best deals. Makes it impossible. I can't look for flights on my phone anymore. Older version was great!
2016,1,"Strongly dislike the last update. Have no idea why you guys removed travel to ""anywhere"" it was so flexible and useful. Turn it back please!"
2016,2,The latest update has removed the best feature - non specific search. We used sky scanner all the time to find the cheapest flights to anywhere. Please put this back!
2016,1,"I've no idea what skyscanner were thinking, the latest update has ruined the clean intuitive UI of the previous edition. Can no longer search for flights to 'eveywhere', slow and messy."
2016,5,Love the feature that lets you just see what month and day is the cheapest. Makes travel planning so much easier. Plus you can see how well a particular flight/airline is rated by travelers and narrow down options.
2016,5,"This is my go to app. It's so convenient for when I just want to look up a quick vacation or when I'm planning a bigger getaway. Such a life saver. Easy to use, reliable, works every time. I love it."
2016,1,"Where is the search for a whole country?  Where is the search for everywhere?  Skyscanner used to stand out from all other flight search apps and websites,  but now it's just one of the worst!"
2016,5,Wonderful app that is easy to navigate. It constantly updates you about the price changes. I have purchased a flight ticke through it and am very happy about how it turned out for me. I highly recommend it.
2016,1,New update makes this app useless for me. Now can only search for return flights. Can't search for whole month. Can't see chart easily. What gives?
2016,2,Please can I go back to the previous version before the last update as this has made this app worse. I used to like this app before but now you are doing un necessary changes. Leave it alone!!!
2016,1,The new update makes it so much harder to find the best deals.. and I can no longer search everywhere.. my favourite feature!
2016,1,Loved the old app & used it all the time... the new one is pretty much unusable for browsing cheapest flights though. Really disappointed!
2016,1,Now it is useless. All the useful featurs are gone. I kept getting error 51 when selecting dates for hotels. Unless they reverse the update soon. This app is uninstalled.
2016,2,"Since July 2016 Skyscanner focusses on ""top deals"", which -for me- means I can't just search for random destinations anymore. Don't like this update"
2016,5,I have tried many applications for flight search but Skyscanner is the best out there. I like to search with date and graph. This makes me very easy to book cheap flights. Thanks to make this great application.
2016,1,Ill be going elsewhere. Can no longer search everywhere so takes too long. You cant even search a country. Why why why?!!!!!! Just lost a long term customer
2016,2,Horrible update... Before it was so easy to navigate and find the cheapest flights. Grouping the trips in weekends 3-5 days etc? Come on..
2016,1,"Unusable after last update. What a shame. Can't search flights by countries, only specific airports. So dissapointed...uninstal"
2016,5,"This app has several flexible search modes including weekends, monthly, and price based searches.  Also based on your departing location it can suggest thrifty destinations.  Great for last minute spontaneous getaways."
2016,1,It is no longer as simple as choosing two city's and some dates. Now I have to go to three pages just to state where I'm flying from. Please mix the old with the new
2016,1,Where's the everywhere option gone? This app used to be fantastic but no more. I know the graph has been moved but it's a pain. In gutted :-( Please can it go back to about 12months ago before all the changes?
2016,2,"The app before the update was much easier to use. And the ""search everywhere"" option is gone , which was the best feature! Bring back the old app!"
2016,1,"Change it back. I don't want photos of the place, I know what it looks like, that's why I'm looking for flights. Don't assume I'm flying from the UK. This was an unnecessary change."
2016,1,"Skyscanner was a life saver, now I can't even select/match best departure and return flights. Prices haven't been shown."
2016,1,I have many travel application and i can use all of them easily. Now i spend hours to understand how it works and i still don't understand. Horrible
2016,1,"Worked perfectly? Now totally useless,  will be removing unless they listen to feedback and change. Can only hope common sense prevails here.  Hopefully not money making incentives with these changes."
2016,1,The update is horrible and for people with wanderlust who want to view all their options have lost a wonderful app due to the update. Awful. Pervious set up was 100x better.
2016,1,"Luckily the person in charge of the app didn't get his hands on the web site, which luckily still works nicely. This however is totally useless beyond belief."
2016,1,Bring back the search 'Everywhere'...and even if it is possible it's not obvious or user friendly. I've reverted to using the browser
2016,1,The new update is very difficult to use. Can't find anything. The previous version was much more user friendly and straight forward
2016,1,I have used Skyscanner for a long time and I am shocked how they can take so many steps backwards in one update!!! Very poor and I will be using something else from now on!!!
2016,1,When searching flights for everywhere on a certain date you are given a selection of random places. It used to be a list of countries in order of price. This was much more user friendly.
2016,1,"New update has changed the whole app, can no longer view countries in lists. It's a shame as it was my go to flight app."
2016,3,"Last one is much easier for users. I do not know why you changed the interface. Now, I do not know how to buy tickets in one way and choose date."
2016,1,It used to give you an option of looking at anywhere from an airport which was fine if like me you're flexible. Also what happened to the graph telling you the prices for the whole month :-(
2016,1,Why did you change the interface lately? It was the best app ever and now it's like all the others. Too bad...
2016,2,I liked the fact that you could search for flights from the UK as a whole rather than the painstaking process if searching from each airport to find the best price. Saved a lot of time!
2016,1,"the new updated one has destroyed the deals compare on ur app, is unable to search the best deal anymore! hopes u will fix it soon!"
2016,1,"The update removed all of the good features of this app and it is now impossible to find the cheapest flights, particularly if you aren't fussed where you are traveling to. Terrible update."
2016,1,"This used to be a really good little app for finding flights but now they have tried to make it ""helpful"" it is rubbish. Searched for flights from Manchester to Germany for 20th November, got a page of flight offers for December, not what I wanted at all."
2016,5,Very helpful app that helps me to see when best to book my flights. Bit confused after the update but the developers were helpful and polite and I managed to continue to use the app smoothly :)
2016,5,"One of the best apps I've ever used to search for flights with the most accurate results, simple but clearly detailed. And the new interface is great!"
2016,1,Used to be a great app. Did everything the mobile site did with ease. It's now not worth using. Absolutely terrible. Whoever is responsible should bet sacked!!!!
2016,5,You can't find in any other App such great prices and offers. Keep Updating. All the best
2016,1,Latest update really really really bad. Cannot choose whole month or everywhere... totally useless now... I recommend to NOT UPDATE
2016,2,The app was so cool!! But in the last update the interface is horrible!! I can't find the cheapest flights anymore :(
2016,3,About a year ago I reviewed this app saying how great it was except for the lack of multi city searches. When I just returned to the review I notices a reply from skyscanner saying it was now fixed. But as far as I can tell it is still unavailable.
2016,2,"Now full of glitches.  You can't search anywhere and just look at countries anymore, you have to scroll through all destinations (with pictures attached, in case I am booking by photograph???). Why not leave a great app alone???üò†"
2016,1,Price of KLM flight to South Africa wildly different on Skyscanner (¬£767) to KLM own website (¬£563). That's + ¬£204!
2016,1,I thought Ive done something wrong with my app. After reading reviews realised that its an update that messed up such a great app
2016,1,Please listen to the chorus here and go back to your winning formula. This update hasn't been well received.
2016,1,Was my fave app of all time - you could randomly chose where to go with the everywhere function - now that seems to have dissapeared and the menu is too complicated - I have seen others with similar reviews about the updates and Skyscanner replying heat the everywhere option is still there but has to be accessed from a menu - too complicated - I will dump it for now and see if it gets updated again soon and returns to a fun and functional app again
2016,1,Previous version much better and user friendly. Too much of a pain to search all flights to one destination and thus choose cheaper options.
2016,3,Used to spend ages browsing for best deals and always booked through skyscanner. Now   that functionality is gone so will try other apps.
2016,5,"Always gives the best & lowest flight rates... Better then any search engine like expedia, priceline, etc.... Definite must have for any traveler!!!"
2016,5,"I only use this app to find the best prices! It's convenient, easy to use and I haven't found lower rates anywhere else"
2016,1,There does not seem to be a feature to show which days are cheaper to fly on. That was the best part about using skyscanner. Deleting now.
2016,5,Most used app on my phone. No bugs no issues. Excellent for finding cheap flights
2016,3,"Hi, latest version lost the ability to do country searches such as ""UK"" or ""Everywhere"". Now just another App, what a shame."
2016,1,Newest update ruined it. Can't get a graph of prices for any flight. Just guess work. Rubbish.
2016,1,This new version doesn't allow you to look at flights to a whole country or any destination. This is probably what will kill Skyscanner
2016,3,I will use another search app until this one is improved or fixed. Why constantly update apps only to make them worse.
2016,4,Easy to Use & Maneuver flights. I use it to watch my desire flights. Very useful tool. Recommended..
2016,1,"From my most used to travel app to useless in one update. The best thing about the app was the total flexibility in searching, which is now gone."
2016,3,Wow .. i never leave a review and i hope that the owners of this APP are listening .. i used too love this APP right too the point .. Now it got like every other app it ..it used to be people friendly you gave the dates and  were your going that's it now there all this other extra stuff and I don't like it I wish you could go back to the way it was simple I used to tell everybody about this app now I'm not too happy with this app I hope the owners of this app take it back to the way it was simple ... tks
2016,3,"Good overview of available flights and prices around the globe, but could find cheaper prices not mentioned in Skyscanner."
2016,5,"I love the app. It has helped me book flights to Phuket, Gran Canaria, and there will be many more destinations."
2016,1,The new update really sucks.. it's difficult to find the cheapest flights. I didn't like it..
2016,5,Really helped me find the cheapest flight possible. Showed me comparisons. The filter feature allowed me to search the flight that suited me.
2016,5,I've always used this app to book my flights and find deals! Never let's me down!
2016,1,I never write reviews at all but you have totally ruined the app made it so much harder it's not easy to use anymore absolute fail....
2016,1,New update makes the app unusable for anyone willing to fly from anywhere in country's also unable to check flights to anywhere.
2016,1,I used to use this app all the time for flights. Ever since the 'upgrade' I have to use the website instead as the app is so restrictive.
2016,2,App used to be great but now can't even search one way flights and it's so difficult to try out different destinations or start points!
2016,1,"The search to ""Everywhere"" option which is the one of the main reasons why I and most friends use sky scanner is terrible now , its not even possible to search everywhere one way ? Also if it was possible to search from ""Everywhere"" to a destination aswell that would be great"
2016,5,"Can you guys please add the capability to chose the class as ANY.. so that I can see all the options available.. Other than that great app and as always best website ever, been using it for more than 5 years"
2016,1,You're thankful for the feedback?! Don't kidding me: you've killed the application! Useless. Completely useless.
2016,3,"The new update is not so good, it is still useful, but I really miss the calendar, and the way it used to sort the destinations by country first now is a kinda messy"
2016,2,It is easy to use and I like the application per se but the travel agency I found at your site ripped me of !!  You have a bad partner Ôºö(((
2016,4,I have been pleased with this app so far. I find some great deals by using it.
2016,2,The newest update is dreadful. Pointlessly complicated. Don't fix what's not broke.
2016,2,the new updated version is very frustrating and difficult to use. the older one was way better
2016,1,I wanted to check one way flights to anywhere for a specific date. No one way nor everywhere option.
2016,5,it's a great way to find cheap flights. set an alert and buy when the price is right!
2016,1,the app is getting less user friendly.  hard to search and too much unnecessary fancy design
2016,5,A very big help to travelers who want to get the biggest bang for their buck without surfing too many sites. Great job developers!
2016,1,"Annoying to use after update. Difficult to view ""all month"" flights or daily flights on bar graph."
2016,1,Used to be the best app for flights. Of course they had to change the design and ruin it.
2016,2,"The new interface can't do what it used to be able to. Can I ""downgrade""?"
2016,2,"The regular site allows searching to flights anywhere (no specific destination specified) and cheapest month dates, but the app does not."
2016,5,I like the app but i liked it before better and now I don't like the prices no moe good deals
2016,5,You cab keep a watch on a flight to see that price is changing and a lot more. Great app
2016,5,"This one is really a good application, user-friendly . Comparison of flights rates  in one place ."
2016,5,"One of, if not the best app for finding the lowest price on airfare. Can usually find a price at least $5 lower than similar apps."
2016,1,New update has ruined what was a brilliant app. Change for changes sake.
2016,4,You missed up with with the last update: showing travels became sh**
2016,1,Completely flawed app.  Very frustrating app to use.  The developers have the IQ of a banana.
2016,4,So user friendly. Best tool to compare the flight
2016,1,The new app is really confusing! Difficult to find flights.
2016,5,"This is the only app I go to when looking for flights, the cheapest deals all in one place."
2016,2,Can't search for the cheapest flights for everywhere anymore. Disappointing.
2016,1,"Why change it, keep it simple! Would have been 5 star if not changed!"
2016,3,Now when I search anywhere it gives me only the US.  Before I could search by country.  This new set up sux
2016,1,The new update has made the app a pain to use. Utterly disappointed
2016,1,Worst update ever. Please go back to previous version
2016,4,The new user interface is fairly intuitive with a few quirks but once you've used it a couple of times you get used to it pretty quickly.
2016,1,Used to be able to search from.all airports in UK to everywhere but since the upgrade this  can't be done. Not happy
2016,2,"There are no filters to sort by alliance, nor does it display booking category beyond just 'Economy' and the like."
2016,4,"I think this is my favorite app for finding flights, works well."
2016,4,Awesome app..Not only aggregate fares from various platforms but also have some useful filtering options.
2016,1,"Used to be such a good app...new update is horrendous, so difficult to search and find anything anymore."
2016,5,It shows a lot of information about many trips. It finds the best options.
2017,1,"Keeps on saying no result for 8-9 times, then shows result. Very annoying."
2016,3,Please add the everywhere wildcard option. Will have to use the website in the meantime...
2016,5,"Best prices all in on place.  It would be good if you could add all details, e.g. how many stops, in a price alert."
2016,4,Like it works great and the cheapest flights...
2016,4,User-friendly. Easy to navigate.
2016,4,Great App...though not keen on new search. I always have to go to quick search.
2016,1,Best app with last update just became piece of crap
2016,1,"Your new version is confusing and even it don't give up to date results, pls restore old version"
2016,4,Shows a lot of options for flights with details and prices.
2016,5,Good App to get a quick perspective on prices and duration for flights
2016,2,I decided to remove app as I wasn't able to search flights into one city and out of another.
2016,4,I think it would be good to have push notifications of any recent flight searches from other people that are unusually low or for any flash flight sales
2016,3,The new update has such a pathetic and confusing interface
2016,5,Please take care of budget air prices coz it is changed- once I enter my name- to the actual price from company site.
2016,4,Great app! Helps me locate the strange and out of way places
2016,1,Before updates I can search as examples from any airport in Egypt to any airport to Thailand but after updates I must choose the airport in Egypt to the airport in Thailand
2016,1,"What has happened to this, used to.be able to put UK ro everywhere, now it's unfathomable"
2016,4,"Usually shows the best prices available, but it's a bit hit and miss."
2016,1,Impractical and basically impossible to just search everywhere and choose a destination from there :(
2016,1,Bring back the old one.. The latest one make us impossible to find the cheapest one
2016,2,"The recent upgrade removes useful features, now no better than the rest"
2016,2,"Their website is a pleasute to use. This app, imo, is a disaster."
2016,1,"desde la √∫ltima actualizaci√≥n es penosa,  complicada,  nada intuitiva,  lenta,  costosa,  antes era muy c√≥moda,  habr√° que buscar alternativas"
2016,5,Any app that saves me $100s gets 5 stars from me. So easy to use too!
2016,1,New layout is really unpleasant to go about the app. What were you guys thinking??
2016,1,"Change it back, need to go on holiday and this is the only way I know how"
2016,4,Please advise why on site have option can select  Maltiple  but no this option in program at mobile?
2016,1,the new version is very bad I can't find what I want the old was perfect
2016,1,"Uninstalling this app now after years of use, the new update is just rubbish."
2016,4,But can't always easily find the view that shows a graph of prices by day and month.
2016,1,Please bring back the old version. This is a downgrade!!!!
2016,5,I had to remove it from my home screen so I wouldn'pt use it everyday. So easy
2016,2,"New : the new design is just a disaster |||  Old review: Easy , fast and useful"
2016,5,Just for the old version.....the new one let me found other app.i hate this new version .plz help us so we can download the old one
2016,1,Just revert to what it was before and bring back the Everywhere search option!!!
2016,5,"Faster, easier, and waaaaaaaaaaay cheaper than anything ever. The end."
2016,1,Their is no option to convert money into aussie dollar.how can i check how much i am getting ticket for.
2016,1,Last application version was excellent now this apps updated and not of any use
2016,4,The only problem is that I am not able to search for one way flights.
2016,5,Love this app. I travelled Europe twice in the past 9 months using this
2016,1,"Hate the new version, impossible to use."
2016,2,can't find out how to put my date

2016,5,Dear Skyskanner
2016,5,Cheap flights
2016,2,"The app isn't perfect for backpackers who don't know where or when there going.  I prefer using the website as you can use it to find the cheapest month. The app previously had this. It also doesn't update prices when you've clicked ""show flights"". Could be a great app with a little more market research. (I've used Skyscanner many times over the years and they're one of the best)"
2016,2,"Been using it for yrs but new update really sux. Pls bring back the old interface!! 1. The bar to narrow down departure/arrival time doesn't work. 2. To pick a different city to ""fly from"" u have to return to the very beginning & input everything again. 3. To select direct flight u have to click into the calendar everytime. What happened to the simple, sleek and user-friendly(!!!) old version? Now it involves so many more clicks and doesn't even do the same. Bring back the old version!!"
2016,1,"I have used this app for years and have sworn by it. The newest updates have made me want to uninstall it all together. I can't search for one way flights to ""Everywhere"" and I can't search for flights leaving ""Anytime"". I have to pick a specific month with a return, as well. I have been traveling without a schedule for quite some time and those features were invaluable to me. Now it is just like all the other search engines. Major downgrade."
2016,4,"Hello! Honestly I love your app because the deals and the simplicity to use it. However, it would be great if you inform on the flight the baggage information instead of tying to see in each airlines. Other apps like yours give baggage information so don't let them enjoy it as a competitive advantage. Because if no baggage information is not available in yours honestly I will reserve my tickets on other place. Regards!"
2016,1,This used to be the best app I use for years to go away 3-5 times a year on random adventures. Just spent 30 mins trying to find even one flight! In that time I used to have searched the whole world of flights. Unusable in every way. Can no longer find any flights. I'm sure air operators will lose money now. I for one will not be using again or going away end of July as planned!
2016,5,"I am absolutely thrilled!  Happy tears!  I wasn't able to afford a trip to see my sister, until a friend recommended skyscanner for flights & hotels. With those two apps I saved $350 total and now I'm able to afford a trip to see her!  Booking was extremely easy and user friendly on my phone. Thank you so much, HIGHLY recommend! &lt;3"
2016,1,"What is this crap? They took the best working app of all of them and turned it into the worst! It just went from a five star to a one star. Very disappointing skyscanner. And that after all my years of loyalty. Why do you have to keep ""improving"" ? It was perfect already the way it was before this stupid update. Change it back."
2016,1,"Where did the chart go??? Now this is just another flight search like the rest of them. Will be switching to Google flights I guess as this is no longer useful when you cant view the prices by each day of the month at a glance, resulting in tedious date switching over and over = just like any other flight app. Lame."
2016,1,The new update is terrible. This used to be my go to app for booking flights as it could always find the cheapest flights across flexible destinations. Now it doesn't perform this basic function and requires a specific destination. Please revert to the old software!
2016,1,Why fix it if it's not broken!? Every update is a downgrade. Wasn't keen on the last big update but this one is a total nightmare. Can't simply check from A to everywhere nor does it give me one way option. The current set up is def not a positive one. It used to be easy& straight forward. why overcomplicate things?
2016,5,"SkyScanner is a brilliant application. It's user friendly interface makes it easy to understand and use the application. Allows you to put price change alerts, helps you cross check rates across all major flyers and airlines as well offers various filters like duration, price, airline etc to fit each specific search according to your travel needs. The application does not just allow you to survey the market but also make the airline end booking and ensures your plan is set to fly off."
2016,1,No idea why you have changed it. Best feature removed.... can no longer choose Uk as departure point and have to select specific airport which takes an age and it's now no quicker than using the individual budget airline websites...
2016,1,I was using your app all the time but now it just doesn't work for me. Where is the oprion of searching chepest daily flights for the whole month? I will need to look for a new app if you will not bring old options back.
2016,2,"I used to love this app, but the constant unnecessary updates and changes have ruined this app for me. It is now more complicated to search for flights, thus making the app less likeable, more difficult and less likely for me to recommend to my friends and family.    You should change it back."
2016,1,As title says. Got rid of all the convenient features. Can now only search for specific cities rather than countries. Also no easy way to find the cheapest flights. Website is still great but the app is ruined.
2016,1,Every time I search for a flight now and want to see a different date it takes you right back to the home page and you have to put your preferences all back in again. Totally frustrating. Wont use now if this is not sorted.
2016,3,I got this app to find an airplane ticket for my grand daughter she is 9 and has been flying repeatedly several times a year from Texas to Maryland but found out it can't help me when I look for a ticket for her it adds an adult ticket automatically and she Flys alone. So it doesn't work for what I need. I guess it would be OK for couples or family.
2016,2,Tried to see what flights were available for the second week in December between MTJ-SJO and you only came up with American.  I know United has more flights and better prices.  What gives?
2016,1,"Took me about 5 minutes to find a one  way flight in the new version. To go from such an easy to use app, to practically unusable in one update, I'm almost impressed with dev team"
2016,1,"I just hate the last updates, its terrible I used to love this app with the older older version! It was soo easy too use! I will search for a new app to replace this one."
2016,1,The latest update ruined a perfectly good app. I'm going to uninstall it now until the features which made the app useful are brought back - unless anyone knows how to keep the app but uninstall the latest updates?
2016,4,it's very helpful.. I feel that I always found the best price flight with skyscanner. Thanks for always with me in every my traveling..
2016,1,The new update is terrible. Can not search everywhere from my nearest airport. Can not search best prices in the month. Hope i find another company that was like how this used to be.
2016,4,Are now non existent on the app....but i do like all the other addons like hotels and cars.  Still irritated i cannot do one way flights though.
2016,5,Great app. Have not booked any flight yet from it. But the information they are giving in this one application is really awesome.
2016,1,"There is no options such as ""multi-cities""! Only round trip, it is useless! Please add that function!"
2016,1,You've now removed the functionality to search a country as opposed to a specific area of the country?! Are you mad?! Almost like you are trying to drive your users away!
2016,5,I love this apps. It gets u the best price and also rates up the price based on the quality of the whole flight experience (the time it takes to travel)
2016,2,It's wonderful that the app tells me what the lowest rate for a one way flight is. But not allowing one to book our even indicating what airline the flight is with renders the application useless.
2016,1,"Useless,  please we want the previous version.  You just ruin a really good app"
2016,1,How come you changed the way it searches for flights? It's so much harder to look for cheaper deals now...
2016,5,Absolutely helpful if u looking for flights... checking on all competitive sites n getting the best deal ...
2016,1,I can't select one way. I cant select everywhere. I can't... and the filters good for nothing. Looks more and more as momondo but worst than.
2016,4,Not sure if the latest update is a plus but other than that it has been a good tool to get some references
2016,4,Saves me the time of looking for tickets for flights when it monitors them for me itself. Less worry about when to get a purchase done
2016,5,I just need to choose where I want go and it does its job to provide me price options of my flight...indeed...Helpful
2016,1,The older version was a life saver for me. But now it just left me dead on phone. I want the older version.
2016,2,The only reason i downloaded sky scanner was for their ability of booking multiple journeys in their website but unfortunately it is not available in their app...its similar to any other travel booking app..
2016,3,"Add the country wise search for flights ,like all airport price from destination that will be helpful"
2016,5,Really easy to use and always get my flights on here unless they are part of a package deal!
2016,4,Why did you change it? It was perfect how it was. Now I need to pick a month instead of it telling me which one is cheapest.
2016,5,"Very easy to use, and it has the cheapest flights around. Perfect for a weekend getaway."
2016,4,Always useful! Thanks for making good app.
2016,1,I booked a ticket in using this App which costed me 100‚Ç¨ more than what is shown in Website. No use of having this app.
2016,1,I used this app and I but all the details include my bank card and they said that they will send me a message on my email  but they don't how can I make sure please help me and also they didn't ask about my passport number it's not normal
2016,5,Skyscanner invariably finds the best flights. It's where I start all my travel plans.
2016,5,"It help me too much ... thank you for developers , and advice them to update it."
2016,4,Please add multi location flight checking option just as you have it on the web module
2016,5,Always use this app for all the flights I book. Really good and secure !
2016,5,Easy and very helpful..... Booking flights could never be as joyable like that !!!
2016,1,"New application Is so stupid you cannot find anything, 2 days searching for option one way :(((("
2016,5,Really loved it. Cheapest price ever & very smooth application.
2016,5,Cheap great and effective. I have been using it for all my travels.
2016,1,This latest up date does not work for android on samsung been using this app faultless for 3 years until latest.
2016,5,Shows well and accurate information in perfect ways and connect you with flights around you
2016,1,After the update is very disappointing...hope they will manage to improve the app.
2016,5,Loved that there are more budget airlines to choose from. Thanks
2016,1,The new update is dificult to use. Please change it back.
2016,5,Great tool to search best flight ticket.
2016,4,muy buena la app. pwro faltan aerolineas de bajo costo
2016,4,"Completely functional, but maybe the interface should be more simple."
2016,1,"The most recent update has ruined the functionality, beyond useless."
2016,1,I shall have to uninstall the app because of disapearing of a calendar of prices..
2016,4,Love the constant updates to flights.
2016,5,"If you're flying anywhere,  get this app.  You won't regret it!"
2016,4,Good app to choose cheap flighs operating on the given route.
2016,3,I am geting lesser price while searching but while finalising it is giving higher price.
2016,3,"How to book multi city,,can't see anywhere."
2016,4,Could be a good partner like always. &lt;3
2016,5,Price alerts features are the best damn thing
2016,4,Nearest to the best rates available online on carrier website.
2016,1,I can't even figure out how to use it anymore. I'm only 25
2016,1,The developers have undid all the best features of the app.
2016,5,"Quick, easy and even sends you updated price changes."
2016,5,"Very simple,informative with several options to help you decide"
2016,5,I think anyone would travel this app will be very useful & helpful to use

2016,5,Very uesful apps
2016,5,jhakasss....
2016,5,Quite f
2016,1,"I would constantly use this app to search for the best monthly prices, but now you can only search my date, like every other generic flight app. If I didn't know what date I wanted to go to a certain place, I could easily use the monthly checker, why the hell would you take this out? I see you haven't removed it from your webpage, so why from your app? Change it back, or you'll lose a lot of your app users."
2017,2,"No more ability to search ""anytime""?  Searching anytime used to be possible for one way tickets too.   The new search results are disappointing now without country heirarchal sorting.   When I search for ""Brazil to everywhere"" I get a sea of Brazilian cities.   How is this useful?   This app was a unique gem with it's extreme flexibility in finding the cheapest times or countries to find amazing deals,  but now,  it's just like any other.   Please,  don't change the website,  at least I can still use that."
2016,1,"This used to be the best app for broad flight searches, I loved being able to search everywhere, by whole countries or the whole year to find the cheapest flights. New update however is horrendous, not user friendly at all and destroys all the features that made Skyscanner great and different from all other flight sites. Very sad that I can no longer use this app for my travels"
2016,2,"App appears very limited. Functionality when looking at flights is presently limited, cannot choose a different return destination (i.e. multi-destination) additionally one way wasnt an option either. Was hoping this app would be very user friendly. However i am sure this is very easy to fix & look forward to using when it is."
2016,2,was a good app that did lots of things well. the last few updates have ruined it all. request you to bring back the old app with the clean UI in the current one. don't fix what's not broken in the name of development. look forward to seeing the app back in former glory.
2016,1,They replied to my comment but I accidentally deleted my comment. Anyway neither the chart nor the calendar shows the prices anymore. It used to be that you can see the price while scrolling through the chart view. That was a useful feature. I am a little flexible with travel dates so I use the feature to find the cheapest price of a time period.
2016,2,I book all my flights through sky scanner...about 15 in total so far love this app.    *edited* i really hate the new update please  change √≠t back im having to look √°t other sites aswell as trying to  use this one =( it used t√¥ b√™ so great.
2016,1,"What are you thinking by making me choose specific destinations and exact dates. The five star element of the old app was choosing anytime and finding the best prices. This app is now unusable crap and I'll be deleting it, having used it happily for years. Idiots!"
2016,1,"Not as practical and clear as ot use to be. And on top of that finds f all. The dates I was looking at ""no direct flights and all the rest ¬£700 ¬£800 went online found 2 direct flights for ¬£300 return so don't use that its misleading as hell"
2016,1,"Used to love it but now I hate it! the new update  doesn't let you search the whole month or just fly from the UK you have to put a particular airport in! What a load of crap, why mess with something that didn't need fixing!"
2016,1,Skyscanner it wasn't broken so why did you fix it? I now have to specify my destination. Can no longer put in UK or everywhere. Get rid of the hotel and rental we want you for flights!
2016,1,"The whole reason Skyscanner was better than all the rest, is because if you were flexible.. It allowed you to look at flights without restriction. Searching from ""United kingdom"" to ""everywhere"" at ""anytime"" of the year showed you the best price. Now I have to specify an airport??! What even is this?? Expedia??"
2016,5,This app is so perfect and accurate just no more worries even for last minute flights...  Always so convenient and reliable and cost-effective way to show the prices on each day so that you can plan your travel on less expensive days...
2016,5,"I really like the UI of the app. It has been made very user friendly, easy to handle. I like how I am shown the cheapest days even before I select my dates, letting me alter my plans accordingly."
2016,5,"Launching the app freezes my screen. I can't even turn the phone off, the only thing  I can do to restart it is removing the battery. :("
2016,5,"Thank you for making UI easier to navigate!  FYI, VietnamAirline fares in the app is not included full tax and fees making it looks like the best fares but it's not."
2016,1,Change it back. It's barely usable compared to a few months ago. It seems both less functional and less user-friendly at the same time.
2016,3,My go to place for booking flights as you do find cheap flights... just don't believe the price it says because once you get to checkout it has increased
2016,2,"Where have these options gone? Ruined the app now by having to put exactly where you want to go rather than being able to see where is the cheapest or from which UK airport is the cheapest to go from. Disappointed, was a 5 star app before"
2016,1,"Hate the new set up.....so hard to use now..used to be able to search whole months at a time, selecting random dates. Now it asks for specific dates. .change it back please! !!"
2016,2,I can no longer search for Ireland to a specific country.. only lets me pick a specific airport and not the whole island ... along with other update nuances ..
2016,5,We love to travel thats why we're always using this apps. This app makes my job a lot easier. Thanks skyscanner...hope to see more cheaper flights from you!!!:-)))
2016,5,"So far this is the most useful app to book the cheapest possible flights.  If there's any better,  I'd be surprised."
2016,1,Everytime this app is updated it gets worse. I dont want pictures. I want to search for flights. Stop it please. A great app ruined!
2016,1,Displays the price but how can I select that flight it is not given anywhere. It is like attracting you with low prices and then leaving you mid way!!
2016,5,Been using Skyscanner for about 4 years now. Very reliable and great rates!  Love the way you can look at an entire month's overview and pick accordingly.
2016,4,"I use to pre plan every business and leisure trip  trough this App.Very Handy also in case you need to replan quickly a trip via different Airports.I may suggest : function to invert departure to destination, and a function to check quickly 2/3 days before and after the investigated date."
2016,3,Pretty much useless without the multi city option. Seems like a pretty basic feature to have that Kayak does really well.
2016,1,How do I even conduct an effective search without a multi city option? That's why I downloaded the app in the first place...it's totally useless to me now
2016,5,Brilliant best app ever works flawless gives you a great oversight of your flight a rating of 10 plus keep up the gd work!
2016,5,Always helpful when I want to get a flight. Even though it doesn't keep the same prices always when going to the flight company website to finish booking.
2016,5,"Just the way I wanted. Easy UI , fast results. Low fare calendar is just excellent."
2016,1,"This is now hopeless, used to like to random places that you could get to when selecting 'everywhere' as a destination, even if it took a couple of flights to get there, now it's all ruined and not enjoyable anymore"
2016,5,"Love this app...easy to use , good visiualizations for people to get the best price and plan thier trips"
2016,4,It's helpful and I'll find a wide range of opportunities that it might help in choosing ur flight and what I like the most is the rating of each flight based on the time and money u should give a try your gona Luv it
2016,3,I have noticed many times websites you send us to do not have the same prices why can Expedia guarantee the price of prefer Skyscanner but I always end up checking Expedia to make sure ticket price is accurate
2016,3,"Not bad, but doesn't offer much over and above the website experience. Difficult to do that really as the website is good and the main focus for the company."
2016,1,Was looking at prices for 2 adult and one infant. ...this junkie program will charge full fare for the infant.....
2016,1,Bunch of Indian crooks calling after booking a fare asking for more money. Do NOT book with these guys. Crooks
2016,4,Easy to use. Great way to find cheap flights!
2016,5,It saves lots of standard prices. Saves masses of time too. Dependable.
2016,1,The new update is awful this app is unusable now. Bring back the old version asap.
2016,5,Found a cheaper flight using this app in my first search haha awesome. Going to add it to my arsenal
2016,4,Like it very much.  Gives reasonable  amount of options.  I use it frequently.
2016,1,It's not user friendly. Old version was easy to understand!
2016,5,"Good, one of the best. Other than Google flights."
2016,5,"One of the best apps i ever used. Just mega mega fluid and so handy to work with, Very helpful. üòâ"
2016,5,Every travellers dream app. What's better than having a SKY scanner on your hands? ;)
2016,5,Easy to use.... and love it how it shows and compares the prices
2016,5,Saved me bundles on flights using your app. Thanks guys
2016,5,Gives me a lot of choices. Thank you!!!
2016,5,Best app to compare prices of flights and find cheapest tickets üòä
2016,4,I havent had much exposure to this app yet. But it looks good!
2016,5,Helpful and very useful. Easy to use. Better than Expedia
2016,3,The prices shown NEVER turn out to be correct and usually double or even more when you click on them.
2016,1,What have you done. This was a great app you've ruined it it's awful !!!
2016,5,Guys..nothing to describe...if you want to pick the best n track your flight..u r at the right place!!
2016,4,"Wish it would do a multi city trip search, otherwise I would rate it a 10 out of 5!"
2016,1,The graph system was far the best way to book via this site
2016,4,App is grand but the hotel option would be good too
2016,1,When redirected to websites prices are often different to the ones showing in the app
2016,2,Recent update has resulted in me using sky scanner on browser more than I use the app.
2016,5,If you know you want to go to a destination  but are flexible with your travel dates this app is a real winner!
2016,5,"App is great, saved me more then 300$"
2016,5,No matter what screen size you use sky scanner is effective and user friendly
2016,1,"New update is horrible, what a shame..üí©"
2016,5,Good to know rates currently for each day n month.
2016,5,This app is just the best..  Keep up the good work
2016,4,Liked the app..it is good tool with alerts
2016,5,"amazing app, gives u access to the cheapest flights from across the world"
2016,4,Developers had done a great job.
2016,5,In this application fares also quite less when compare to other applications.
2016,5,An awesome app which makes finding prices at great prices even easier on the go
2016,5,It's a great tool to scan all of the airlines!
2016,5,Best among all apps availble for same purpose

2016,1,This app sucks like there's no airline flying on that place because they can only cater one airline. I'm from this place so I know.
2016,5,I love this app every time i get new grand price for ticket flight on my favorable destination!
2016,4,So far really good
2016,5,Love it. I want to give 100 star.
2016,5,Really good app for booking!
2016,2,"I started using Skyscanner when I was travelling more for work and back to visit my family. My usual airline was getting expensive and I needed to find the cheapest flights. This worked for my usual routes - now I find time to plan my dream holiday in the Dominican Republic. I find a lot of days no flights are shown, and if I select a departure date it will only show return flights within 10 days. Other return flights just disappear. However if I search for flights with airlines it's any day I want."
2017,3,"I'm rating this app three stars because of the functionality it once had and because I'm optimistic the developers will fix the issues.   The last 4 or 5 times I've dreamingly plugged in dates for an international escape later this year the app has come up with no search results. I adjust dates to even a month out and still zero results come up. I used to love daydreaming with this app, you know...plugging in hypothetical vacation dates just to see what the cost would amount to. Hopefully this will be fixed and I can continue dreaming without using google to search for prices and trip durations."
2017,5,"Feel good about the Skyscanner. However It seems airpaz is the only non-trustworthy agency on Skyscanner that Skyscanner should seriously consider the soonest possible for the interest of its android clients either to become trustworthy or or get kicked out of the Skyscanner listing. Once you attempt to finish an incomplete booking on airpaz, the price will be increased ridiculously, but the original price is still available using a new user. Also a lot of complaints on internet about the dishonesty of airpaz kind of cheating money many times either confiscating money along with the flight ticket purchase failure without being able to contact airpaz consequently for a refund or cancelling ticket confirmation without informing airpaz customer."
2016,5,"Since installing this app and on screen widget l find l am using it constantly. Easy to use, accurate timely updates, visually informative.   Have yet to book a flight but will book several today, see how it goes.  The +/- one-two days bar graph feature is very useful and the on screen widget is particularly useful as it reminds me to get my flights sorted......Thankyou for a great app."
2016,5,"It doesn't have some of the cheapest small range airlines in Europe, so after each search I would search those website individually. But the price scan over the month is helpful. I wish you like search by arrival city, instead of departing city."
2017,1,"Installed it, made a flight plan round trip from any airport in the DC area to any airport in the grand canyon, it could not be done. Not even a simple flight to new York from Reagan airport. I uninstall junk."
2017,2,Designed for phones so crap on my tablet then! More often than not says cannot search. The app on my windows phone is much better. I am sure it could be so much better.
2016,4,"Very usefull app for travellers, perhaps even the best one. However would be flowless and close to perfection if had had charters flights as well. Hopefully ;)"
2017,1,Does this app only work for some countries?  Trying to look for flights from Montreal to South Africa to any of the major airport as well as changing the dates but it doesn't show anything
2017,1,Not sure what happened. Used it fine up till Feb 2017 and now it keeps showing no results no matter what I search. Wonder if it has to do with acquisition
2016,4,"Reliable, honest results from a large range of airlines. The prices are not as hard to beat as they used to be though."
2016,4,"Great app, especially appreciate the email updates of when flight prices change. ..you just need to try it"
2017,3,hard to adjust flight schedules when rates aren't clear ...takes time to reload unlike earlier versions
2017,3,"Not bad, but not complete enough to make me not revert to the website. Biggest missing option is to search nearby airports, both departure and destination"
2016,5,I always use this app to source my flights. However I only buy the flights either directly from the airline or a reputable agent like expedia ebooker etc. Beware of small time agents!
2016,4,Good app for flight bookings.. Great comparisons of lowest fares
2017,2,After reinstalling everything is working fine and it's easy to plan trips. Awesome.
2016,4,"Allows you to see flight a vailibility, and cost. Good app."
2017,1,This terrible app send me to gotogate when i bought fly tickets. Totally scam. The worst experience ever
2016,5,Love the app. Whatever connection it recommend. I got the same from agents as well
2016,5,This apps is so best and all flight details not offer price
2016,3,Compared flight price ...sometimes not reasonable price..tq
2017,1,Searces continually return no results..used to love skyscanner...given up now
2016,1,It always says no result. I wrote all the dates but not successful.
2016,5,The feature of viewing the prices for whole month is just awesome.
2016,5,Taking advantage of offers. Found many deals to the Caribbean
2016,5,The best software for finding the suitable flight.
2017,5,This app all flights time and price prefect  show
2018,1,Used to be great but they have changed it and now it is totally useless
2016,1,Price shown is in gbp but currency mentioned is Rs. Its a bug.
2016,5,Having a reliable reference for the availabity and bracket amount of flight throughout the world so I dont have to btowse each and every website

2016,1,"New update is shizen! You have to know the name of the capital city of every country to search flights, dunno how good your geography is mr.Skyscanner..... but mines not that great. You guys had a good thing going on but now, ehhhhhhhh. Think ill check out some other sites."
2016,1,"You can no longer change any search parameters (like direct flights only, economy,etc) until after you've done a useless basic search only by destination. At that point all the previous info is no longer valid and previous steps a waste of time. Even within Europe you get useless results with 3 connection flights and travel time of 15hrs for what should be 2hr journeys, only to find that when you select direct flight only there aren't any. Then you have to start from the beginning."
2016,1,"From start to end after all pages you going through,  they try to justify why the initial price is became double and more...scam. All this passing from app to flights providers sites...everyone look to find a reason to get you pay more. Reinvent yourself... Ideea was good"
2016,4,"OK, so generally this seems fine. Personally though I feel the options of this and similar apps could be so much better. Living in rural UK for example, I have to travel to ANY airport and would find an option that gave me (say) the best prices to a destination (or any destination) from ANY north east airport most useful. Even any airport within a given radius of my location?"
2016,1,This used to be one of my favourite apps for usability and user experience. So easy to navigate and find flights on a mobile device. Since the update it's nearly impossible. Resorted to the website until it's sorted. The app just doesn't make sense anymore from an end user perspective.
2016,1,Do not attempt to reengage me through notifications (!) for a service I need only every few months. Squelching ALL notifications from an app using the OS settings is NOT a solution against abuse of device functionality and is a violation of developer guidelines.   Uninstalled after three years of use.
2016,5,"Very easy to use. Provides a bar graph to easily view the best dates to go places without having to re-enter information. Subscribe tool is great to notify price changes. Overall, best app I've seen to find best deals on flights."
2016,5,"Great application, everything works smoothly and with ease. Simplistic design which gets you what you want and fast! Plus you get no annoying adds. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to get accurate flight information and book flights for any price quickly and with super ease."
2016,5,"This app is everything a traveler would need, who is on a budget and still want to travel the world.  Easy to use, takes the hassle and stress out of looking flights as well as converting to the currency you are paying with. Also has tons of other useful tools."
2016,1,If you're searching multiple destinations and want to go back and forth the usability is bad. You keep having to press the back button to each airport (departure/arrival) separately and recent searches are way below the keyboard on screen. It's just really clunky to use and needs improvement
2016,1,New update without the anywhere &  anytime option is such a big step back that I have removed the app. Flexibility  of looking for the best price is what made this app unique. Edited the review to include the loss of anywhere & anytime option after feedback from the developer.
2016,5,"Hands down the ultimate airfare ticket finder app you will ever need. Even cheaper prices than Google Matrix website. Nice design, easy to use, the price trend feature is very helpful. Highly recommended."
2016,5,I have always checked and booked flights through sky scanner and I love it! If there are any issues it's usually with the linked sites and can be sorted out easily. Keep up the good work üòâ
2016,5,I travel a lot every year. This app makes it easy! Definitely the best out there if u wanna make sure u get the most options& the cheapest flight. Google should just buy it & make it the standard Google flight!
2016,3,Good app but when you buy the tickets on some sites you get a email back saying sorry the price has changed to get your flight you need to pay the extra. What's the point of finding cheap flights if the price isn't the true cost of the flight.
2016,5,"Intuitive, sorts results in any order you need. Works without having to login to just research flights. Includes Southwest, doesn't charge any fees. Highly recommend!"
2016,5,The app itself does what you ideally do before booking a flight - find the cheapest airfare deals available from multiple agents. And the experience is smooth and hassle-free!  Just loving this app.
2016,5,"I've used Skyscanner for a couple years to plan all the flights for my various trips, and it has definitely helped out a lot! They are getting a lot more efficient too, mostly cosmetic but also in making it simpler and quicker to find the cheapest rates"
2016,4,I clicked the bell button but it says 'unable to create price alert'. This is a really good app but would love it if this could be fixed. Thanks !
2016,5,"I like the UI it is clean and easy to find whatever you are looking for and the search is fast for the number of results and air companies it is retrieving data. also can't leave behind the ""alert"" feature that sends email when there is a significant price change."
2016,1,New update is awful and messy and makes it incredibly difficult to do some things in the name of making the design sleeker. Can no longer easily browse the cheapest flights to anywhere instead have to enter a destination
2016,5,"Great and easy way to search for cheap flights. Gives suggestions on cheapest time to fly. Has an option to look at flights for ""Everywhere"" to see the best deals for international and domestic flights."
2016,4,Nice interface and unparalleled aggregation. I have just one complaint. They don't allow flights to be filtered on refundability on cancellation.
2016,4,Great app and ive used it lots of times. But ive just updated it and the price comparison between days is gone? Is the button that used to be at the top moved somewhere else as it was great to compare prices between several days?
2016,4,Excellent application that searches all Airlines even the low budget ones. Share function is awesome. Please add multi-city search option!
2016,4,"For instance, notifications on a specific flight combo with specific departure and arrival times would be more useful. Or at least notifications that take the filter into account i. e. notify when prices drop but only within the filter parameters."
2016,5,Reliable. I love how they also have PHP availabl e as currency while others have very limited available currencies. Makes it easier for me to find good flights as i dont need to convert anymore
2016,4,"I'm using this app for couple of years now, and managed to get better prices for my overseas  trips then in any of travel agency. Thanks"
2016,4,"The new version is very user friendly and really useful.  Just missing to be able to search for multiple-stop trips (A to B, then B to C and then C to A)"
2016,5,Amazing app. We can find cheapest flight ever. Also the app recommended us a star vise catagory so it can helpfull for us also
2016,5,Have not yet made any booking. But the interface is very cool and pricing seems transparent.  Thumps up.
2016,4,Great and efficient app. I would love to be able to search multi-city flights just like on the website though.
2017,4,"Great app! User friendly, best prices. Does it accept all credit cards from.around.the world?"
2016,5,App is super easy! Removing and adding alerts finding the right flight for the right price. It's perfect.
2016,5,"Very helpful and worry -free. A real planner, searches out the most cheapest flight accurately."
2016,4,"Like the per country origin and ""anywhere"" destination possibilities. It would be great if one could specify a list of places, e.g. comma separated."
2016,5,Easy to use. I've booked 2 international flights using this app. Just great.
2016,4,why there's NO cebu pacific plane flights? Only PAL and air asia. please answer me
2016,3,The app does not allow user to scan for multiple cities booking. It will be perfect if it comes with this function
2016,5,"To obtain and monitor price changes among the airline companies, it is a magnicifent app. Highly recommended and appreciated!"
2016,4,"The app is great,  easy to use and true.  I did a side by side check on airline website and the prices are the same."
2016,5,"If I wanna book or search for a flight a year and a half from now, this app not foresee that far...if only they could extend their reach to 2years from now that would be awesome...anyways you deserve the fifth star so, no worries..."
2016,1,I bought  airline tickets online many times and after taking money cancel my ticket.  It's so bad program for booking
2016,5,Awesome app! Booked a couple flights using this app and got great deals!
2016,1,Please revert to the old version of the app. The new one is a step backwards.
2016,5,Pretty simple and lots of results. Installed lots of apps but ended up checking this daily when looking for flights.
2016,5,Simple and effective. Makes booking flights super easy!
2016,4,Very useful and quite friendly user appk. Tqvm to the developer.
2016,5,Best flight app I've used. Prices as good as competition apps.
2016,5,Last updates add very nice options and specification. Well done
2016,5,This app is really great. Just tried the flight section and its simple
2016,4,You can easily compare the prices and choose your flight
2016,2,Change it back.. This update is really not good.
2016,4,"Good app but need some improvement add more airlines like AirBlue,Shaheen Air operating in pakistan."
2016,5,I use this app to find and compare flights.  I think it is useful and easy to a apply.
2016,5,It's a very helpful tool when looking for the best price to fly!
2016,4,Excellent app but if you go directly to the actual  airline website it would be cheaper. Sometimes up to 100 ‚Ç¨.
2016,5,It gives you the cheapest flight details on the go. Love it.
2016,2,I'm used an interface where I choose multiple airports near London in one go but it only allowed me to choose one
2016,5,"Love the filter options, great to be able to cut the flights down to just the times/airlines your looking for, 5 stars."
2016,1,"I searched for a particular date, and when I was connected to the airline it showed the flight for ONE MONTH LATER."
2016,4,"I find it OK, no problems yet, and I'm saving money, as i said, does the job. Well done."
2016,4,This is the only app I know that will let me search flights to anywhere . It's good
2016,1,"Doesn't work, won't allow me to purchase flights"
2016,4,Hey it remind me d cheapest flights tickets ..love it
2016,5,"So much quicker than trawling the net for the best price,been using sky scanner for years now üòÄ"

2016,5,Thanks skyscanner team... I'm finally going abroad again thanks to you.

2016,5,I have been using this app for many years now and never let me down...brilliant
2016,5,"Great way to find flights for a specific weekend to anywhere you want, or to find the best dates to go to a specific place you want."
2016,5,It's great how easy to know all flights possibilities at your finger tip.
2016,5,Don't waste time using another app .. this app is what u r looking for

2016,1,"It was a great app before the update, which deserves 5/5. But the update has taken away what was working perfectly fine! It's confusing to use now and it doesn't give me the information that i need. Probably i should try the web version as other recommended. But no more app... i'm going to uninstall it."
2016,1,"The new app is useless, I have always used Skyscanner regularly, probably once a week on my phone. Now I prefer to wait until I'm on a computer as I don't find it user friendly and struggle to search for the flights I want. On my s6 I am not able to enter an entire country, use nearby airports or search for flights to 'everywhere'."
2016,1,very slow updating the widgets. sometimes it takes forever. i have fast net connection but its like dialup for fetching price updates etc.... when you touch to refresh the widget on home screen there is a 3 second delay till anything happens. then it takes a while to fetch the updated prices.
2016,1,"The new update is simply dreadful. I don't understand why people can't just leave things that work be. Don't download the app, just use the website because I've never wanted to undownload something more than the new Skyscanner app. It is so confusing. Not as easy as it used to be. And shouldn't be in a legitimate app store."
2016,5,"I have used the website before, but the app is brilliant. It easily points out the cheapest flights by day and month and I booked some very cheap flights because of this information. The app does crash a lot on my galaxy tab 3 8"" and I have sent the reports so hopefully this will improve. However, the app is so good that it gets 5 stars despite the crashes."
2016,1,"Want to check times of return flights - doesn't work. Want to find a return flight - cannot type the name, sorts by price, what's the point of that, takes ages then cannot find the location. Sorry but app sucks."
2016,5,"I've used this app in various countries & it is way better than kayak & expedia. It definitely came in handy when I needed plane tickets at the last minute. I missed a flight & had a flight get canceled, this app was very clutch in both situations!"
2016,2,"This app it good but on alert i don't have flexibility such as I want to know total price depart n return and option/extra detail if add luggage,food bcoz it common ppl want too .. It good u give depart and return on alert but I wish flexible option to choose my own time n price showing if different option I choose..."
2016,2,"I've used skyscanner for quite some time and it was always good,but lately it seems the prices that get found are not the same as when your transfered to buy your ticket which is very very annoying. I think I'll try a new search service for a while ."
2016,1,"Before the recent update, Skyscanner used to be my go to app for searching flights but the recent update has taken it backwards by leap and bounds. It's now over complicated and a pain to use....."
2016,1,Developers and testers probably smoked too much w**d during the project of this useless new version. Simply unbelievable. 27/07 Decided to uninstall it
2016,1,"1st page 477 price . Go to the booking section , jumps to 531 .head to the webite to pay jumps again to 637. Almost 200 usd jump in 30 secs . That my friend is a lie."
2016,2,The app doesn't permit multi stopovers  (the website does) and there is no option on website or app to be flexible wit dates to reduce price fares. If the app could do both of these things five stars all the way!
2016,1,"I always used the website,  thus time I used the app it is crazy,  not flexible at all. It should be much easier to choose one way or two way. Also the app chose the origin itself,  so stupid app."
2016,5,"I'm very happy that I've found this AMAZING apps. It's very convenient for you to search the flights using this apps, especially if you're trying to save your budget. THANK YOUüòäüòò"
2016,5,I change the way to buy flight tickes forever! I got this app yesterday. My first ticket was buy wile my wife get a hair cut. Life is mobile!
2016,4,"Looks like a neat little app. Very easy to use, cuts right to the chase. Doesn't have an option for multi city tho üòï"
2016,1,"Have never seen an app ruined to this extent by a single update. It was 5/5 before, now I don't feel it deserves 1/5, and no, I'm not exaggerating."
2016,5,Very helpful to track flights. Maybe live updates on the flight could be introduced as well. But then it might take touch memory :)
2016,5,Used this for over 20 flights now. Always a great price and easy to use. Never have any problems with the app on android. Happy days.
2016,1,"Much more limited for browsing destinations, which gets rid of everything I liked about this app. Why do app makers always make ""various upgrades and bug fixes"" that seriously decrease the utility of their apps? Uninstall"
2016,1,"Loved the old version, but this is nowhere near as good. Can't understand why you would change an app that everyone likes."
2016,5,really good and informative apps! easy to compare ticket prices and got the best rate available. will use it everytime!
2016,5,"Like it a lot. The app is very useful, I booked some flight using it and it was a great deal. Five stars for overall."
2016,1,This used to be the most flexible & informative app. Now the results come in an useless pile of randomness. Yes 5/5 down to 1/5 in one update!!?
2016,5,It is easy to use and it has given great prices.  The price alert function has been great too. Would definitely recommend it.
2016,5,I'd love to be able to see the history of the pricing fluctuation of the flights I'm currently following. Be nice to see for a future reference when the cheapest time was to buy the ticket
2016,1,"Why,  when i price flights, is there over $100 difference on my phone app compared to my fianc√®'s phone app?? Seems dodgy"
2016,5,Great app to search cheap flights to any destination. User-friendly and so easy to handle compared to other apps.
2016,1,"Hate the update on the app, why do companies update their apps and make them worse!! Go back to the old version"
2016,3,Its decent app. Only concern is when you check few times prices start to shoot up within minutes
2016,5,Great app! Saves alot of time searching. I wish the hotels app works too!
2016,4,Hard to find info on quantas plus wheelchair friendly providers re weight wheelchair also discounts. Food diabetic
2016,5,Each & every information related with flights just one click away. I was desparately searching for this kind of applications for long.
2016,5,It is so useful and efficient. I can  shorten my time on searching flights. I like to travel on last minute.
2016,5,I like the rating system and the app works without a single glitch. Wish they would add multicity searches though.
2016,5,"Quick, accurate and has found me several deals.  I have flown more now due to this app."
2016,5,It lets you compare prices from across all service providers ....nice app...well done team.
2016,1,Was great until the last update. Now I can't enter a departure city which renders the app useless.
2016,5,Best app for flights search even my flight agent is now alert. He knows I know the options as well.
2016,5,"This is a great app, nice UI and really smooth animations. Easy to use and good information given."
2016,5,So helpful! Especially the things to know. Simplifies international travel!
2016,5,Has better features than other apps such as seeing entire month and checking off direct flight option from initial search screen.
2016,1,"The old app was so simple to use, but this one is rather confusing and dosen't allow for the same scope of searches, etc.  Better just using the website."
2016,5,I always check flight options via Skyscanner and it give me great deals and options that is not offered by similar sites.
2016,4,Doesn't offer multiple city airport. Otherwise works without issue.
2016,5,"App is convenient, gives you option of cheapest dates. And also, prices for all airlines starting with cheapest"
2016,5,Thinks of every detail to help find the perfect and cheapest flight. Love it!
2016,5,"Nice, easy, up to date consistent flights identified. Good stuff"
2016,5,This is my go to app to book flights.  I travel at least twice a year and this is the first app I check to determine when and who I fly with.
2016,1,It find the flights but doesn't redirects to it. BS app
2016,3,This is actually a great feature on the website but not available in app. Disappointed
2016,5,"Great app, super user friendly. Fun to use"
2016,1,"No multi-destinations, and the interface is very fisher price, extremely cumbersome."
2016,5,Best app for getting cheapest flights.  Very user friendly
2016,5,"Apart from one thing - I can't find how to quickly filter departure and arrivals times, but there's a way around it, by sorting by rating."
2016,5,Great app. Makes it easy to find the cheapest flight and also has a wide choice of airlines
2016,5,ALWAYS book my travel through this. So easy to navigate!
2016,1,O valor mostrado no app n√£o chega nem perto do valor final q geralmente √© o dobro
2016,5,Great app that will help you get the best flight for your trip!
2016,5,I love this app. Simple and shows me all of my options. üëç
2016,2,"I found a deal then it takes me to a page and says just a min trying to load and the page to the ""cheap"" deal never shows up."
2016,5,Simple to use and give you all the necessary information to decide on the flight options available
2016,2,not enjoying the update.    much better before
2016,1,I still found better deals on the airline webpage..and saving much more money.
2016,4,Very good flight finder except if you want to go in a country that is not very known such as French Guiana
2016,3,App was amazing until they upgraded it and now everything is hard to use and doesn't work.
2016,1,If it ain't broke don't fix it.  And u guys tried and ruined it
2016,3,works but interface is less clear than previous app
2016,5,Great app works well - best deals and details
2016,2,"Hard to choose dates, prefer the old version which is like the mobile website which I use now"
2016,3,Would be great to see Fly Blue Crane South Frica and Fly Mango South Africa flights as well
2016,5,This app very useful find low prices on flights very happy with this app
2016,1,"This new update omg, not working well, it is useless and it was the best app before."
2017,1,Its getting worse. Kayak is much better than this app.
2016,5,Always best prices for flights. Love it.

2016,4,Loved the app before better than the updated version now..
2016,4,"Great app, best for the frequent traveller and newbie alike ;)"
2016,3,"Website has options for multi destination , on the app this option is that there?"
2016,4,Love it just wish it also had options for luggage and seat options etc
2016,5,"Wish they sorted out the less than reputable companies,  but easy enough for me to do with a free app."
2016,5,Is one of the best platform you can get just what you want. ...
2016,1,Much prefer the old. Will be installing as it is so unintuitive
2016,4,Useful app and wish multi city can be applied

2016,4,"I always compare flights and fares before actually deciding which airline to use. Once decided I crosscheck with the actual airline website. It checks all the availble airlines & saves time. Wonderful application, very useful & my favourite."
2016,4,"I have only browsed through the app and it's not bad, a bit confusing at times but I have an issue with the fact that it doesn't have my currency as an option, Trinidad and Tobago has their own currency so I'd rather not get the prices in US dollars which is very misleading and I don't have that problem on the web version."
2016,3,"The app seems to work fine for me. But it kept a service running in the background, which hogged about 30MB of RAM. I'm uninstalling since I don't want it slowing down my phone while I'm not even using the app."
2016,1,Me informe acerca de las agencias de Viajes que aparecen en esta app y por lo que pude encontrar el riesgo es bastante alto de perder tu dinero o parcialmente. Ejemplo busquen en la web comentarios de la agencia Travel2be y se dar√°n cuenta que muchas personas han sido estafadas hasta existe un grupo de Facebook para denunciar.
2016,5,"Easy to use, fast and reliable. Saves time. Great Job team"
2017,5,Love this app use only of reservation my flights 5 times a year never have problems with it is amazing and can't live without
2016,4,Good app to find chepest flights
2016,5,Very helpful with lot of data
2016,5,Practical the best out there
2016,5,Useful & easy to use
2016,5,very good apps
2017,5,Save lots of time to plan trips according availability of tickets
2016,3,Nice
2016,1,I love it
2016,5,All that I need.
2016,5,The best
2016,1,"As lots of other users have already said, this app update has completely ruined what previously was a fantastic piece of software. The new design is totally confusing, it's arbitrary whether a search let's you specify 'whole month' or not when searching, the screens are now crowded with information and it is now slower than the old version. So wish I hadn't pressed the update button. Keep hold of the old style app for as long as you can!"
2016,3,"The idea of searching for flights to anywhere based on the date and vice versa is amazing, except that the prices shown are never the actual prices on the airline website. Sometimes they don't even have the flight which was listed on the app, so I'm uninstalling it because it's no use having an app which you can't trust. I really hope they work on it to make it more reliable soon, then I'll certainly download it again."
2016,1,"I absolutely hate this new version. So much harder to navigate to find the cheapest prices. I used to depend on this app to book all my flights, and loved the simplicity of it. Less is more guys, and if it aint  broke - no need to fix it! Please please bring back the old app!!"
2016,1,"Functionality of skyscanner was great, ease of use to explore different flight options, switching destination and origin, assess prices.. Now there is extra steps to it all. Having to back and forth.. Even visually not as good. Awkward and not very useful new features"
2016,1,"Before the last update, this app was amazing, loved it, fast and easy. After the last update there's a new user interface that misses all logic, the departure airport disappears while entering the rest of the search, filters dont work any longer, and finding the right flights was made impossible. HOW DO I GET THE OLD APP BACK?"
2016,1,"Bring back the old version! The new UI is not very user-friendly. If still available, I can't figure out how to reverse flight directions or easily filter. I think the new version has clearly substituted style for substance and failed miserably."
2016,1,"I used to love skyscanner until the new update, you focused too much on graphics but now its not user friendly. Difficult to navigate. And the bars all look the same. I cant tell which one is cheaper."
2016,4,Thumbs up for easy to use interface and including all possible sources for flight rates. Makes it really easy to chose between various options. Also a great feature is the price alerts. In all a very handy app for travellers.
2016,1,"The new version of app is clunky, frustrating and non intuitive.  The old one was perfect. Now you have to click loads of places to get same result"
2016,3,"Rated 4 stars previously. A great app but in the latest update there are issues with the filters. Not major but means that you have to scan through the flights, taking more time."
2016,1,"My previous review showed this app was the best in town, low spam, low ram usage, easy to use UI now it's gone as useless as every other spam app on the market. Uninstalling!"
2016,1,When you develop something crappy you should admit and not look like an idiot.  That's what I have to say to the Skyscanner team. This new version is simply a disaster!
2016,5,3 day's use so far and no problems.  it had a great feature that allows you to scan per country and month and average price.  love this app
2016,1,It was easy to navigate in the older version. This new version is difficult to use and is not mobile friendly. Sorry developers but I did not like this new version of the app. Right now I am looking for another app which looked liked your older version of the app.The older version was simpler. This new version is very complicated.
2016,5,"If you love traveling and are always searching for a great deal on flights, this app is very easy to use and extremely helpful when trying to compare prices and places to travel. Definitely one of the top apps for finding and comparing flight deals with trip dates"
2016,1,This new update is less intuitive and not very mobile friendly. Loved previous version and this new one is much more difficult for something as simple as searching for flights
2016,5,This is seriously the best thing since sliced bread. So easy to use and save you so much money on flights! Wowza is how I would explain it.
2016,3,"What has happened to you guys?? Even the app was more simple before this new design, it was more useful. I really miss to option to watch all the of the availables flights for an specific date."
2016,1,you really broke the search & why the heck is it called Flights in my phone - I'm used to look for Skyscanner (you could add the option in the settings)  I'm going to search for tickets on the web as the search in the app is so bad now
2016,5,I wish I would had had this app sooner. I travel a lot and now it is much easier for me to check on the best Deals and when I want to fly. GET THIS APP !
2016,5,I've been using this app for 3 years and I always come here first. I find the best flights up here without searching multiple websites.
2016,1,"Old version was amazing, this is pants ,so difficult to navigate around, old version was very simple and user friendly , why fix something if it isn't broken, bring old version back please"
2016,5,"I've compared this to all the low air fare sites and none beat this! Maybe the same,  but  I don't have to visit 10 different websites for the same results! I love this app."
2016,3,"Fastest way so far to check one cheapest flights. However, no mulit-destination option available."
2016,4,"This app was brilliant,  but succesive updates have ruined it.  If it's not broken,  don't fix it"
2016,1,So much harder to find cheaper fares now. Used to recommend this app all the time. No longer will
2016,5,Great app...so easy to watch and favorite flights. My new fav tool for flying!
2016,5,"Shows what i need, within a short time. Using the help of the filters makes it more better.Thank you"
2016,5,"Coupled with a really simple and user friendly website and app, this no frills attached service is easily the best in class."
2016,1,I downloaded this app. Price is very high compared to flight official website. Totally disappointed
2016,5,I use it all the time and it works well.  I wish it could do multi-city or stop overs.
2016,5,THE fastest easiest way to find flights/prices anywhere. Brilliant!
2016,3,"Number of passengers in different alerts can't have different number of passengers.when I change number of passengers in one search alert, it automatically changes the number of passengers in all other alerts. I don't want this."
2016,3,Filters do not work on this new version. Can you fix please?
2016,4,On desktop version you can choose multi stops but not this app.   When will this function be added to the app
2016,5,Everyone can use this app...its only shown real ticket fare and flight departure... I love it
2016,3,Don't like the new update.  But the old format was soo much better
2016,5,Just now I can compare so many flights price. 4 thumb up
2016,5,Awesome job guys. Perfect is the word I have for you all. Extremely easy to use and searches entire database to provide best result.
2016,5,Loved how the dates show the prices when selecting dates for flights. Easy to use!
2016,1,Whole month/ whole year feature no longer works properly. :(
2016,4,Realy easy to use. Clearly scans the sky. Thumbs up!!
2016,2,Why filter doesn't work??? For me it's so important be able to check flight time
2016,2,Why no Cebu Pacific flights in the Philippines? Awful omissions.
2016,3,Es una actualizacion pero no una mejora. Tal vez sea cosa de costumbre pero me resulta mucho mas complicada que la anterior
2016,5,Very useful. Comparison shopping in one spot! Easy to use and read.
2016,5,Look up flights per month and see the cheapest at your fingertips. Love it!
2016,5,Great way of booking flights. Now super fast too...
2016,1,Useless. Cant even find a flight for dates inputed. Back to my desktop
2016,5,Easy and can see what you want at a glance. Book all flights thru SKYSCANNER
2016,1,No more graph which was a major plus for this app. Hard to search multiple dates now and much more complicated as a whole.
2016,5,Very cool I like it makes easy to find the cheapest flight thanks sky scanner
2016,5,Skyscanner is so simple to use and it is easy to find flights!  Love it!
2016,4,Helps to get a target range of prices weeks before your flight.
2016,4,"Love this app, it's so easy to use and it keeps all your history which makes repeat trips simple to search for."
2016,2,This app needs the multi-city functionality like the full website does. Please provide the multi-city option!
2016,1,You guys took a great app and ruined it. I'll have to go back to Kayak now.
2016,4,"Can search only with Wi-Fi on. With a normal network connection the message ""Need an internet connection"" always appears."
2016,1,"I m pretty sure that a lot of people don't like the new update, me included, this is just terrible update,"
2016,5,It shows you the change of prices between months. üñíüñíüñí
2016,2,Filters that allow you to adjust flight windows do not work on HTC One M8
2016,5,Best traveling app ever!!!! Prices are always cheaper
2016,1,New update is really disappointing...can't work with this app anymore :(
2016,4,Don't expect to change anything about your flight because it will cost more than your initial ticket.
2016,5,"Very useful, thought through from a user's perspective. Love the filter functions such as departure after a certain time."
2016,1,They have now totally changed this app...its now a nightmare to search!!
2016,5,This app saved us so much money while traveling in Europe for 3 years. I recommend it to everyone now!
2016,4,Good app but it's missing Multi City option which exists on the Web.
2016,5,Easy to use. I have used them all and this is the best..
2016,4,Please add a search option which enables the user to search through whole Europe
2016,3,I can't find the multistop option in the mobile version.
2016,5,"Simple, accurate and easy to use. Nothing else I could ask."
2016,5,he can show you every trip and you can shoose the cheapest one....so lovely app
2016,5,Easy to use & understand & gives a good selection of prices & places.
2016,3,Some of the travel agent cannot be trusted.

2016,5,Instantly shows you multiple combinations of carriers and the rating score helps you zone in on the best options quickly
2016,5,I think really good...you don't even need to search in lots of websites for tickets.....
2016,5,"Really amazing, can't wait to book my flight"
2016,5,"I use the hopper app but I like this one better, it has more accurate information and has more options"
2016,5,"This is app is awesome because is easy to use, intuitive, elegant."
2016,5,"Love this app, never lets me down!"
2016,5,Search options improved over few years and skyscanner saves time

2016,4,I Really Like that the price alerts I get.

2016,5,Help you to find out airlines with a cheapest price.
2016,5,Cheapest flights I found for 5 people and at the right times

2016,1,"The unique thing about sky scanner used to be that it would show great deals to various locations, so for instance if you want to tour Europe but don't care where you fly in and it of you can save hundreds by setting that one city happens to be way cheaper at that time.  I'm Uninstalling, it's worthless. Then they told me the everywhere function is under top deals,  but it's not.  And they got rid of the multi month calendar where you could look and see what days were cheaper to travel"
2016,4,I have had the older version of this app for ages and was my favourite  for booking flights and searching . Was a bit shocked how much you changed it in the update.  But I just started playing with it then and I'm  getting used to it . I think it's just so different  from before regular uses get a bit shocked I can see what your trying to do and I think a bit more use I will love it:)
2016,1,"Terrible user interface, impossible to search normally. F this thing. Use kayak or literally any other app. Their website is fine. This is terrible. The developers should be hung and quartered."
2016,1,"This app is just useless. When searching for a flight you're sent round in circles, back to the same annoying calendar pages to select direct flights that it says exist but sends you on a three stop round the world tour once you try to select"
2016,4,I find this app super handy at finding me the best flight deal for domestic and international travel. Not 5 stars yet becuase it likes going blank on me!
2016,5,This is my go to app for flights. Hands down these are the lowest prices that can be found. I even recommend this app to my customers as a travel agent!
2016,4,Best tool for finding flights. Would be 5star if you could search destinations and get best carriers for a season (not exact dates)
2016,5,"Fantastic app, always gives the best prices available, have been able to travel to countries I never thought I'd visit! Thanks!"
2016,5,"When tested against actual flight operators the results are the same, therefore providing a good central source comparison. Nice one."
2016,5,Love the easy to use filters in order to narrow down what you are really looking for in a flight. This is my go to App for any type of travel plans.
2016,5,nice useful app. we find correct price and so easy. I love it
2016,5,Heard about this app through my travel travel group. It's great finding deals on international aswell as domestic flights.
2016,4,"Still seems to have trouble including / considering Jetstar flights from Townsville to Bali, moreso seems to miss Air Asia Bali to Bangkok domestic terminal, otherwise seems great."
2016,4,With simple selection of your traveling date you will get bunch of list from different airlines will flying if date selected. Awesome..***
2016,5,I love the calender being color coded to show what days are cheaper. this is the first app I look at when planning a trip
2016,1,After new updates very bad and at all useful. I uninstalled the application.
2016,5,So easy and convenient to book the best prices!  Love this App.
2016,1,I always encounter the network error! I can't even access the website.
2016,4,All good except I would be better if we could do multi-city searches as well.
2016,4,Don't get me wrong the app is working good but need to improve the search and the selection of the flight option
2016,4,Love all the functions and that it watches potential itineraries for me. Need multi-city function tho.
2016,5,Superb app and service. Best of them all.
2016,4,This app is good. Although I don't like the new search bar.
2016,5,Loved the map previous interface even more.
2016,1,As soon as you select a departure date all of the available return flights disappear from view
2016,4,"So far so good,we will see if I catch a great deal to make it 5 stars"
2016,3,If you want a quick and easy to use reference for prices this is ok
2016,4,"Add an option where i can set a price range for a ticket,  and be notified if avaliable ."
2016,3,Says there's no network yet I am connected?
2016,4,Great app for comparison of flight costs and times and a graphical view of when cheapest months are

2016,5,The best flight search app with the most options for filtering the results.
2016,5,"This is  the easiest to search and it remembers, making it simple to watch a fare."

2016,3,Pls give option in indan Rs  also
2016,5,"Works well, does exactly what it's meant to do"

2016,5,Air travel search engine
2016,5,I m a huge fan and supporter of Skyscanner
2016,4,Super fant√°stico
2016,5,I like it!
2016,5,Flights
2016,5,Mrs
2016,5,Let try
2016,1,"Just downloaded app, it won't let me add departure location, back to Google flights."
2016,5,Very helpful
2016,5,So nice
2016,1,"The search process in the app is terrible. First you cannot choose to search one way flights on the initial screen. For that you have to get to the default anytime field on the second screen and after clicking there, unchoose the return option. So the initial price info is only valid for return flights even if you do not want them. These are two useless steps to choose a one way flight. I have not figurred out how I can choose different airports for my flight legs. Probably I cannot :("
2016,1,"What the hell has happened to this app!!! The old version was brilliant. This new version is rubbish. So easy to check the lowest price flights on the old version, this keeps coming back as nothing found. Gets itself in a mess over outward and return dates and is definitely not as user friendly as the old one! The update also managed to remove the shortcut from my screen. Hopeless. Please go back to the old version or I too will find another flight app. How can you mess up an excellent app so badly! üò†"
2016,1,"I've gotten a new phone and downloaded this app which I used to love using, but I guess there have been updates which make it similar to any other... what happened to the chart showing prices by date??  There is never any data when I try to use it.  That was the whole benefit of using skyscanner, to choose dates based on price. Now this seems useless.  Bummed!!"
2016,1,"The old app was intuitive easy to use and did the job perfect. New interface is hard to use non intuitive and just basically hard to use. Update.  Previously you put in the flight requirements on on page, searched and all the possible airports appeared in a very concise manner.You then drilled down for further info.The new app puts too much info on the search return page and as such looks cluttered and its hard to use and navigate. It tries to do too much. Less is more in this case."
2016,1,Used to be good. Not anymore. Unable to search by month to pick best flight. It just says no data. Even link you gave me to contact you wont open and cant be copied. Used to be so easy to use. Now has me searching for alternative. Please post alternative  with your complaint everyone if you find something like skyscanner used to be.
2016,4,This is a good app. Easy to pick and select your flights and navigate the filters. Only one thing missing. A Multi flight option. What if I want to do a few day stop over in a no ther city while on my way somewhere else? I can't find an easy way to do this other than select individual flights and try to remember where I am. Please add a multi flight option!!
2016,3,I wanna book my flight here coz i found the cheapest flight in my route. But my friend told me not to trust in you coz she booked a flight and she's waiting for confirmation email but then you didnt update her and you get the cost of the air fare in her bank account and she tried to call the airline to confirm but you didnt book it coz the airline told her no flight booked with her name. Please I want you to help me please. I just need to booked my flight. And
2016,1,I thought i was gonna find cheaper prices downloading these apps.Not understanding the need for these apps cause all the ones ive downloaded were more expensive than what i found searching online. You just got to know where to search. Im deleting all these apps that's taking up space!!
2016,2,"I don't know how this passed QC/QA. I like that you tried to innovate and make things easier, but you didn't! The UI has some usability problems (mistapping is the major) and functionally speaking, searching for a flight is very hard because after the first search I need to redo the search again because the screen doesn't react anymore (the app is responding, but there is no output for the actions)."
2016,3,Sky scanner is an amazing app although after the update you can't select more than one destination without having to start again. It also defaults an anytime default setting to a week in May and won't let you change it unless you go through the main screen and do it all again? Hope this can be fixed (or old version reinstated) quickly as this is one of my favorite apps and I'm not liking this new time consuming version. üòî
2016,3,Great format but find selection a location in the everywhere choice only works on my first 'click'. I have to reload the page by going back to see the different options for that destination. Slightly annoying. Will stick to the website for now
2016,1,"This app used to be amazing, since the update it is very difficult to use. Clumsy to navigate and search for flights. Becoming increasingly frustrating with every use. I gave up and now visit the airline native apps to search."
2016,3,"I'm so disappointed that they have upgraded this app from what was previously a fantastic easy to use app. Now it's complicated & unreliable. i.e. If you want to search from a base to a flexible destination once you have chosen that destination you can't go back a step and choose another. I am so frustrated that they had to totally transform such a wonderful app. Also pictures of the destinations, what's the point!"
2016,1,"Not what I need.  No real time flight tracking where there are actual airplane icons that can be seen zooming across the sky so you can tell where a plane your family is on, may be at any one time."
2016,2,"I tried to book a flight through SkyScanner and everything seemed to be going well. That is, until I discovered that the lists are bloated with Canadian carriers which charge in CAD instead of USD. Foreign carriers should be indicated by the app so I can exclude them."
2016,2,"Whenever I choose to fly 'Everywhere', results wil display accordingly. Then I select Country X, decided to go back to the results of Flying to Everywhere and select Country Y, I will remain in the same screen. It is very annoying and cumbersome as I have to restart from beginning."
2016,5,You can select a wide range of currencies. It searches across all airlines and lists the price for each.  Convenient for comparing prices and getting an idea of when the tickets are cheap or expensive. I recommend using it.makes things that much easier
2016,1,"What have you guys done with such an useful app? Now it's next to useless, hard to navigate, slow, not intuitive at all! Why changing something so neat and nicely done just in the sake of having an update?"
2016,5,"Easy, convinient, Good Bye to the times of spending countless hours thru different websites of travel servers and airlines, check it out, maybe like me you will find a great price to some beautiful place that you didn't know about"
2016,1,I checked to a common destination where I using other services gets lots of direct flights on this one I got NO DIRECT FLIGHTS and lots of hits from one airline going through various hubs. I think they sell results.
2018,1,"This app used to be good but it's recently changed and it is now super unintuitive, slow, and only showed 3 flights when I searched for ""Everywhere"". Looking elsewhere."
2016,1,Why has this app gone from simple to use to I can no longer use. It's overly complex and has me trying to find an alternative app for ease of use. Even the widget is inferior to the previous version
2016,1,I had the old app. It was great. This update is so counterintuitive.  No multiple windows! ? No one-way option to start...
2016,4,"In Europe its gives amazingly good deals,  but in Asia the cheapest prices it shows aren't exactly the cheapest ones.  Its missing few airlines or sites in Asia.  I couldn't see air asia which is like the cheapest asian airlines in the app"
2016,5,Great resource.  I use it all the time to get the cheapest flights on some of my favorite Airlines.  I can't believe it's free!
2016,5,"This is the best flight app ever!  Simple to use and great prices on flights, couldn't be improved!  Well done to the developers..."
2016,1,I love your website and thought your app would be great but it's awful! It is impossible to find return flights that are useful as the sorting is nonsensical.
2016,5,"Very useful app, especially when your travel parameters are flexible. Would love to see the multi-city option added to the app please, like on the website."
2016,1,Used to be top class go to for all my flights now it's awful.  Very time consuming to search different flights I will not be using again in its changed format why change what isn't broke you went from a great app to poor difficult to use one why ?
2016,4,The app works fine and it's easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that it has to skip over to the browser for the booking process
2016,5,"Thanks a lot for the app, saved me a lot of money... Could you guys add a option to see from which country is it cheaper to buy?"
2016,2,The pricing is good letting you know what dates are cheaper. Why can I not do multi city trips I can only do return or one way.
2016,3,"There is no multi city option in the mobile app,only available in the desktop version. Can u fix this?"
2016,4,"So glad I found this app, but would love to be able to a multiple city flight and see a total price of my saved flights"
2016,4,When searching if you try to go back... It lets you but then you can not select any options to go forward again. Have to restart app. Samsung S7 edge
2016,4,Good app displays cheap flights and all options. Just wish it did multicity trips like the website.
2016,5,Best way of checking the right flight. Happy with it. Works very well.
2016,5,I actually did not expect it would have so many capabilities! Easy to use and works smoothly.
2016,5,"With the ability to set price alerts, leave dates AND destinations open when searching for flights, this app is hands down the best flighr app i have used"
2016,5,"Worth the downlaod, very mobile friendly and smooth user interface. Great job SkyScanner."
2016,4,This app is great! I love that it even includes Southwest flights in it's searches.
2016,1,New app is confusing and removes features. Dreadful. Don't fix what ain't broken
2016,5,"This app is dope, best one ive found for cheap flights. Get around it!"
2016,2,The app is rubbish after the latest update. The fares cannot be selected ..
2016,4,Awesome apps! Use most of the time to search flights for holidays
2016,4,Unclear to see prices. Why complicate? Simplify!
2016,5,this is the best ticket searching engine ever! very easy to use. I like it!
2016,2,I don't like it that I'm getting unwanted notifications about past searches. I'm trying to find a way to turn those off.
2016,5,The best prices on internet within a minute. Excellent app!!!
2016,5,No more website hounding. Just sky scanning. Brilliant App!
2016,2,Older version was easy and simple to use this version show me price in Euro
2016,5,I find it easy to use and saves a lot of time coz it does all the comparisons for u so all i have to do is choose wat u want. ‚úå
2016,5,"And appropriate permissions, very rare nowadays. Thank you!"
2016,5,"After I install it and restart my phone, the widget is suddenly gone, literally gone!"
2016,5,Great app for finding flights. Stays up to date.
2016,5,Very useful in gauging airline prices. Easy to use
2016,3,Can't search for multi trip on app...if you could it would get a higher rating.
2016,5,I love this app! I've used it ever since I found it 2 years ago!!!! üòç
2016,5,"Always get the best deal and loads of diffrent flights, amazing"
2016,5,Was able to find the best flight/fares for my Paris trip
2016,4,Seems accurate and easy to use. A multi-stop option would be useful but not essential.
2016,5,Easy to use.. simple.. best price.. like it..
2016,5,Does what it says... Saves good money on flights
2016,5,"Love the deals, the set out is nice and simple and has great prices"
2016,4,Even though many dislike the new update I prefer it as it shows the cheaper days a lot clearer than the old update :)
2016,4,I like it. But may I suggest...  Multi-city search?
2016,4,The alert came at the right time showing a great savings option. So far so good.
2016,4,Ramp handler Queenstown  Corp Jets services. Helps us a lot.
2016,3,"Kindly add filter for journey time also like upto 20 hours, upto 25 hours upto 30 hours"
2016,5,Great design. No obnoxious stuff anywhere.  Great job
2016,1,Sends stupid Notifications that I can't find a way to switch off
2016,4,Let's me know when flight price drops so I don't have to check so much.
2016,5,"When my friend first told me about this App I was sceptical, but I find it SO easy and helpful to use. Glad I got the App."
2016,4,Although the application is good but the new interface is complex to use.
2016,1,They dumbed down the app and made it useless better off with kayak now
2016,5,"Great app, great site! Absolute cheapest fares of all the discount sites."
2016,4,The best app to view the different fares and very user friendly.
2016,5,I have been using this app for years. It's the best one out there
2016,1,Bring back the previous. You're losing me.....
2016,2,Nice but not like go ibibo.
2016,5,Nice App with good comparison. Plz add the distance between the airports.
2016,1,So I have to rely on Android app manager to shut you up? 0 stars if I could
2016,4,Easy for me to do flight fare comparison..
2016,1,Old one was better. If it ain't broke!!
2016,4,I am surprised at how good this app is. Keep up the good work.
2016,5,Use the search with multiple tabs to let your imagination take on some concrete figures.
2016,5,"Great... Booked several flights using this app now, very easy to use..."
2016,5,Has all of the cheapest flights and makes all of your preferences known by the easy filters!

2016,2,"I'm a frequent long distance flyer and have been using Skyscanner for years now to compare prices of different routes and make bookings. But since the interface revamp, this has become an onerous task. Skyscanner, Please feel free to contact me if you want some feedback on how it can be improved."
2016,3,"I downloaded this based on a recommendation but so far my expectations haven't been fully met. To test this out I searched dates for a flight I just booked and my airline didn't come up at all. I guess Southwest isn't included despite what the current Money magazine article states. Disappointed in that but a similar priced flight did show up for Delta, albeit a different airport in the same city."
2016,5,"This is a great app. It is very easy to find a flight that fits your budget and schedule. You can search specific dates and airports, or choose two general locations and easily see what arrival and departure days are cheapest by the generated bar graph. I love how nice the material design is, which makes navigating through the app fun. And the price alerts are a great tool for knowing the cheapest flights for where you want to go. Plus, no ads. This is my wife's and my favorite flight search app."
2016,2,"Been studying this for a while now and I have to ask, how many incorrect prices do you show??? For 5 days you haven't had the same prices as you get through Cebu Pacific. You state 8000 baht as a group price but can't get the flights any cheaper than 11,600 baht via Cebu. And it's not due to seats, baggage or tax. Just simply the wrong price. Very frustrating!"
2016,1,"You used to have the best flight app ever with the old interface I used it almost daily, now you must have spent thousands turning it into one of the worst designed apps ever, it's just so hard to find anything relevant now, its useless searching from my phone, I end up waiting until I'm near my laptop. Does anyone know of a decent flight comparison app so I can delete this one?"
2016,2,"Comes with Boingo free WiFi in Dubai, not much good if the connection is bad!!! It is hard to rate your application when it is packaged with a lousy WIfi provider, change your partnerships, or get Dubai Airport to improve their service. Then you may get better ratings?"
2016,1,"Revising my rating to 1 star. Two days after I purchased my tickets, the price went down by over 20%. Skyscanner cost me $50 with their low quality app. STAY AWAY!"
2016,1,"This app was perfect before they updated it, you could easily find the cheapest price by looking month to month, 1 click for single or return flights, the new version is a joke, I have been using the new version for over one month now and even for someone whose computer savvy it fails on so many levels, I recommended this app to so many people prior to the update, I'm afraid to say I have uninstalled it now."
2016,5,"It's simple, it's fast, it has any sort option you could possibly need and it covers a ton of airlines. Makes shopping for flights so easy, even if just to find the flight you want and shop price on other sites. Great tool for the constant on the go traveler for business"
2016,2,"I loved the previous version.1) In the new one you can't go directly watched flights (specific dates) to the graphic prices (no dates). 2) when you open graphic when you can't see prices, you need click on same date to give you the price. Can you give back the last version? Thanks."
2016,5,"After missing a flight,  I was able to pull up my search on Skyscanner and it found me a same day flight for less than the original flight I had missed! I was able to get to the ticket counter and get a new flight with no hassle at all (except missing my flight to begin with). It was the simplest search ever,  even under pressure from rushing and failing to arrive in time! Literally saved my sanity!!!!"
2016,2,"Prices shown are from 25 then when u click on it, it is somehow from 55 the cheapest and then u realise its only one way and on the days nobody wants to fly. Am I supposed to spread the w-o-m that this app has the cheapest tickets? Not impressed."
2016,4,"More user-friendly version. Better UI. Hope they retain the dates after a previous search to save more time and not to input the desired dates again. Overall, I am satisfied with this app and recommending it to friends and family."
2016,5,"The Customer  Service is very good too. I am planning to go to RDO-RADOM Airport, Poland  and I couldn't  find any  flights  to this airport using the flight searching apps. I have contacted  Skyscanner  and Jon from the Customer Support actioned this to be added to Skyscanner in no time. I always use that app and with that good customer  services experience  I am more than happy  to recommend it to everyone ."
2016,5,"This is the best App that I've found for looking for flights. Anywhere. It's easy to use, give you price ranges when looking up dates so you can pick them according to your price range. It's easy to book. I use it every time! Love it!"
2016,5,"Used it to search out all available flights to my desired international destination, select the airline, time and cost I wanted, and was impressed how the purchase linked straight into Expedia. Even more so that the ticket price shown on Skyscanner matched the actual price paid, which I've found is not always the case on other flight search apps."
2016,5,I love the whole month price comparison. It really help you plan your trip. Very user friendly. Nice and easy design. It also has fare alerts. By all means use it!!
2016,5,"I love it but I love it more if u can show like a calendar or prices for a month then it's easier to search for cheapest fares. Anyhoo, I love this that I hope I can give 10 stars. Keep up the good work"
2016,1,"But since the new update, the button with the bars disappeared on the top right and now you can't compare the price of the flights around the date anymore.. It was the best feature of this app imo"
2016,5,"Finds every possible flight combination for trips you're planning, priced low to high. Let's you easily choose departure/arrival times too. Fantastic app!"
2016,2,This app keeps spinning me in circles. I'd really like to give it a chance but I'm frustrated. I select my cities and date and it keeps showing me a calendar to select dates. I can't move past this part. Please help
2016,1,Just booked the flight overseas they wanted a photocopy of my passport and front and back of my credit card hell no! Went back to CheapOair I'll pay more but I'm a whole lot safer
2016,4,"I mainly use this app for the 'search everywhere' function to see what cheap weekend trips I can make. But, I wish this app would tell me the aircraft type as I'm a bit of a plane nerd too."
2016,5,"So simple to use! Very user friendly, I love the fact it saves airports. I have yet to book a ticket but I hope that goes well also."
2016,2,"My main issues with this App are that it's called 'Flights' rather than 'Skyscanner' and that it keeps sending spam push notifications with no way to turn them off. The name makes it tricky to find the app when they're arranged alphabetically, and I don't want a daily push notification asking me if I want to book the flights I browsed last week."
2016,5,"Need little improvement as there is no option available to search flights for multi destinations.. like I want to travel from point A to B, B to C and finally C to A. But no search option available. If u can kindly introduce this feature. Regards"
2016,1,Just cannot make head nor tail of the new interface.  Just want to see the cheapest days for a whole month from UK airports.  Just can't work it out.
2016,4,I've used this app many times to make bookings. It choses the cheapest fare or stay possible almost every time. I would recommend it's use in conjunction with other apps as a check.No bugs so far.
2016,3,Used to be a good app.  Doesn't give the results in list like before.  Always says no data available. Searching for dates 3 months from now
2016,1,"Update is a load a crap, can't even check one one flights, only let's you search a return journey..what's that about??? Old version was much better and easier."
2016,5,"I really like this app as it has option of ""everywhere"" and ""anytime."" I have different apps like this but this one is my favorite. Lots of great deals!"
2016,5,This is the only review I've ever left on the market store. This is the best app ever for booking flights. I've used this app for the past 5 years and it's gotten me the best deals
2016,2,Maybe I'm missing something but I dislike checking for the price of a flight and then having to go out to search for the price. It's just not as good as it used to be.
2016,5,"Works great, it's better than the website. One improvement recommendation would be adding an option for low-cost airlines."
2016,4,Really nifty. Love the price alerts and flight ratings depending on length and price. Would add dates to layovers to avoid confusion
2016,5,I love this app. The alerts make it easy to know when the price goes up or down so you can purchase. Good job on this app.
2016,5,Looking for tickets to Cannabis Cup last minute.  Was looking at $900 for rountrip tickets from the East to West Coast .  Skys ticket prices we're less than have of other sites!!!!
2016,5,"If this had a multi-city function, that would be fantastic. For example, I'm flying out of my home airport, visiting 2 different countries, then returning back to my home airport. This function would be helpful in determining pricing and timing for visiting those 2 other countries."
2016,2,Where has the option to search an entire month gone? This was the most useful feature. The website still allows you to do this.
2016,5,Accurate pricing results that is synchronized with the cost found on the websites the app is retrieving information from and it facilitates transferring to the travel agent/ airline website to complete the selected trip transaction.
2016,1,Don't use this thing to book a bus ticket (redbus).. Nither you will get a ticket or a refund.. Soo much angry..üí©
2016,5,Best app to find cheap flights! I'm so glad there is an app like this in the world! I hope to start traveling soon
2016,1,Please go back to previous app version. Can't even click through to book with airlines and horrible new layout.
2016,5,In other words I searched flights from London to verona in September the cheapest flight Skyscanner could find was ¬£240 and 7.5 hours with 1 stop.went on a well renowned UK travel websites that found 4.5h flights for ¬£200
2016,3,Gave old version 5stars this one 3 as when I click flights from bar graph and then done button  it takes me away from flight not to flight times and to booking have to then search again with specific dates
2016,4,Good apps.. Easy information. But please in the future give more option from the other airlines..
2016,3,"Pretty minimal interface but please name it Skyscanner not ""Flights"". Also a way of clearing individual searches."
2016,5,"One of the best app for air traveller!! Made life easier, gives yu all the information about the air schedule keeping it economical!!"
2016,5,"Liking the app. Going to compare it to others to verify prices are best, but it's easy to use"
2016,1,They have ruined this app with the new update. The old set up was far easier amd quicker
2016,5,I am loving this app so far.  I have yet to make a purchase but when I do I will update my review.
2016,4,Nice app and claims no booking fee but gives a little bit more expensive options than other apps like cheap flights.
2016,4,"Keep adding more providers, would be good experience if purchase of ticket is integrated in Skyscanner from any or available providers instead of redirect to third party website."
2016,5,"I almost open this app on a daily basis. User interface, flight details, price are the key features, which makes this app best..!!!!"
2016,3,"Bookings does not clearly state baggage allowance, how do we know if we're only allowed hand luggage or 20kg or 30kg ??"
2016,3,I used this app all the time before. The new look takes a bit of getting used to. It was brilliant.
2016,5,Great app!! If you could have multiple flights as well would be brilliant
2016,5,Very simple app that finds best prices. Easy to change search criteria.
2016,5,Love this app! Always cheaper prices than other flight apps!

2016,5,This app is good for looking at a variety of flight combinations and prices and it works quickly :)
2016,5,I always get the cheapest air line prices using skyscanner. I depend on this website.
2016,3,Needs multicity and return options. Will have to uninstall app and use website instead as not enough flexibility with the app.
2016,5,Couldn't be easier to use! Nice graphics and performance! Keep up the good work team! :)
2016,5,Easy to book flight and compare the prices between all available airline companies.
2016,5,Love it so much... New experience for app.. Very nice
2016,3,The experience is nowhere near as intuitive as the last. Huge fan of SS and happy to bump to 5* when changes are made
2016,2,"New app is terrible. Old one was perfect, if it's not broke don't fix it."
2016,1,The app does not correctly interpret exchange rates. I was charged way more than listed.

2016,5,"I use it all the time- everyday! But, I don't Like the updated format!"
2016,4,"Good apps to find air tickets, hotels."

2016,5,I don't know how Skyscanner does it but they have have saved me several hundred dollars in the past few flights for past few months

2016,3,"Now when I choose the cheapest dates in a month price diagram and then check all the flight for the chosen dates, the prices change! It seems that the prices in the calendar are not updating on time and you can see the real prices only when you pick the final dates. Very misleading! I would like to keep using skyscanner as I have been doing for many years, but.. Hope you can fix it."
2016,1,"I tried paying with my card and it was declined multiple times. I figured that there might be something wrong with my card so my mom tried it instead and it was still declined by this company. With all this time that I have wasted trying to get them to accept my payment, I most certainly could have gone elsewhere and bought a cheaper flight because they are far more expensive now. If an HR representative reads this, they had better find someway to pay me back for the ridiculous amount of stress I've been in"
2016,3,I signed up with email but can't login to the app. When I select login the email and password entry screen opens momentarily then a blue block of text shows up at the bottom saying Google Smart lock and my email address. As soon as it fades the main login screen returns (the one with login options like Facebook etc.) before I can even type in my email or password. I'd like to create an alert and don't want to use social login which is why I signed up with email but it seems to have been pointless. Nexus 6p
2016,1,Saigon to hanoi... There 's maybe more than 20 flights daily (no it 's not a joke).... In this app... I have 1 flight every month and very expensive (most expensive ever as in vietnam it 's really cheap the flights)... I have no idea how this app finds such expensive flights (maybe only from the most expensive company only)
2016,5,"It's like going to the doctor in us. You never know exactly the price or value you are receiving on most airlines. Be transparent!! If I want to pay for better seat or class, I will. You do not have to con me. I recognize the value of a sleeper on a 20 hour flight to asia."
2016,5,I only write reviews when I'm frustrated or impressed. Have seen all other apps (those relevant to India at least) and Skyscanner looks up ALL offers from all websites and agents to REALLY get you best deals including any cashback options on obscure websites you may have never heard of before. I've recently done three such bookings and have saved at least 5% over and above the best rate offered. Without a doubt presently the undisputed King of Flight Bookings in the app market...
2016,1,"Was double charged to the tune of $380.  He's the charge removed,  just to see that our tickets were canceled.  Customer service atrocious.  $380 went somewhere and now we have no tickets. Will never book through this app again."
2016,1,"The new interface is dreadful, people shouldn't have to ask for help in Play reviews. The old one was far clearer and more streamlined, the new one is just confusing and nothing takes you where you expect. I'll just use the website."
2016,3,"For some reason it's showing me prices that are way, way higher than when I search on Google Flights or even directly on the airline site. I double checked to confirm that specs are the same (airports, dates, etc.) and they are. Weird."
2016,1,I  despise the new update so much that I'm going back to using kayak I guess. This was my favorite travel app ever. Now it's trash.
2016,2,"Checking the same app on two mobiles, android and apple. Apple has much more offers therefore much better prices. As app I will not use it, better to log in from laptop."
2017,5,You become smarter in flight bookings with this app. The trend helps you pick the best time for cheap tickets. Good real time analysis for quick booking ( helped me while I missed a flight). Easy to use.
2016,5,"Works well on my old Samsung note. Easy to find cheap seats.   Also good on new device, but new version not so easy to use if you so not have a fixed destination in mind."
2016,1,Only want to look for direct flights. Yet have to wade thru 1000's of non direct flights first. As you can only apply filters after an initial basic search.
2016,5,This is a great app for finding tickets. It Is very simple and finds you many flights and you have many options. it is kind of like trivago for airplane tickets. Everyone who wants to simplify buying plane tickets should try this app!!!!
2017,2,"Preferred it before. don't need to be told where to fly to constantly. Beyond me why companies think it's ok to pester you with 'how about doing this?' notifications. That really work? Oh skyscanner suggested I go to Paris, ok then!! I'll go!  :)"
2016,1,Each time I Want to search a flight it keeps telling me no results found when I input the town I want to fly from. Pretty useless. Am uninstalling
2016,3,I usually love this app but for some reason it's not showing all of the available airlines for flights. Will this issue be fixed soon?
2016,5,"Best app. It always shows me the best deals, and because of that I have been able to see many places I would have otherwise not been able to. Best app ever."
2016,5,Great for being able to see when cheapest rather than going through actual dates.  I like to plan holidays around cheap flights so much better than other sites
2016,4,"It's a great app. And very helpful .. only one thing is missing , ""The Multi-City"" search option. I hope to get it soon"
2016,4,Very good in finding cheap flights... but few flights are seen on the site... Still its a great app
2016,3,Have had this app on n off my phone for the last 2 years.  Don't like the last update.
2016,2,App works fine but some flights are overpriced. One flight with easyjet was twice the price compared to using the easyjet app!
2016,4,"I love the way I can search the flight details. It helps me to plan my holidays or travel, just on my handset."
2016,1,The selection by airlines doesn't work. I always use it without problem until two version ago
2016,5,Good price analysis. Easy to use interface. Allows flexible ways of travelling when searching for price.
2016,5,"I am a traveler, I need quick and certain info ... I found it here... great app... couldnt find cheaper flights..."
2016,5,"Outstanding tool for holidaymakers, without it I couldn't manage to prioritize my multi-city trips."
2016,5,Always looking for last minute flights for a quick and fun 2 day trip. It helps being able to search flights to anywhere.
2016,5,Best app ever.Always very low prices. Was recommended by co worker and i have used it multiple times.
2016,1,Used to be good but now is awful the user interface & layout. Definitely not on a par with Kayak
2016,5,Love the interface and the ability to search tons of flights. Being able to save results is nice as well.
2016,4,Vary intiitive minimalist user interface. Vary fast you can find best prices.
2016,5,This app is easy to use and finds better prices than other apps in this category. 5 stars.
2016,4,Really like it. Improvements should be made in how price are shown!
2016,4,Love it for checking quick flight price. Easy and fast results.
2016,4,We always love this app and use it to choose cheapest flight available from location.
2016,4,Cool flight search app. Simple and nice interface.
2016,5,Filters and settings are easy to use and simple. Results provided are accurate! Awesome stuff
2016,5,It helps me get the cheapest rate and allows me to change time and flights. This app is awesome
2016,5,Good app. super dupper fast. Thanks.
2016,5,There's a new airline called Siam Air from Bangkok to Singapore to Bangkok flight route which is not in the app?
2016,5,Easy to use and accurate.  Booked many trips using this app.
2016,5,So far the best prices for flights that I've come across!
2016,5,It got me great deal on airfare. Easy to use.
2016,5,"Very convenient. The navigation, filter are very easy to use"
2016,5,Very useful aplication. Give the best price
2016,4,I've tried several times using this apps. So far so good
2016,1,"Difficult to use, main website is better. The previous app was so much better."
2016,3,Its showing completely different prices in the app and the website..Is it only for me??!!
2016,1,Very poor this app now old one was awesome you should fix soon
2016,5,As a standby passanger this app is amazing! Just pay attention to bag fees because sometimes they are more than the ticket!
2016,2,"Misleading UX - why does it start on the NEXT month and not the current, and not warning about it??"
2016,5,This app had become essential to me. Keep up the good work!
2016,3,There is no multi stop option as opposed to the desktop version.
2016,5,I use this app religiously when I'm traveling the country.  Has saved me so much money!
2016,2,"Agree with other comments, the older version was much easier to use."
2016,1,Okay app but no multi city option which really let's it down !
2016,4,Almost as good as Google flights search
2016,5,I found my flight using this app. I got my flight cheaper than any others
2016,5,So useful but bring back the world view for searches without a set destination!
2016,5,great app...really u can find cheap flights
2016,5,I'm a travel agent and this app tells me where to book inexpensive travel on a certain date.

2016,5,Best flight search site I have used so far
2016,5,Easy to book and search from multiple airports!! :-)
2016,5,So easy to use and the cheapest flight prices out there

2016,5,how apps should
2016,5,Champion app
2016,5,
2016,1,"I downloaded this app because of a great deal on a flight i was looking for, and then wound up cancelling the flight. Why? I thought something was odd when two hours after booking and paying for my flight, no charge had yet been placed on my card. I then recieved an email saying to call customer service as soon as possible regarding my reservation. I was directed to a call center in Georgia where i spoke to a rude man with a heavy Indian accent who told me that the airline ticket price went up by $800!BS!"
2016,3,"I like to go find routes and prices, then go onto  proper airlines websites to book. I wont update as people say its not worth it. Its crap you cant have multi city, im planning a trip soon but cant check in the app..."
2016,2,This used to be such  a useful easy to use app  for scanning  flights  and prices.  Now it involves  starting  from the beginning  everytime  the departure  needs changing. Also the information  is nowhere near  as precise  as the previous version.  Probably a good thing  all in all as it'll stop  me from being  tempted to book weekends  away all the time.
2016,2,Don't like the new interface. Makes what was once a simple to use app overly complicated. I also miss the feature that let you quickly flip the to/from cities.  Was very useful when comparing one way flights to return flights. Now it seems you have to  start a brand new search from the  start  page to compare the  one way flight back ?
2016,4,"I found the app great however some minor tweeks to the selection/home page. It would be good to have the date option in a simplied form i.e. in a digital form. Also, it would be good to be able to select the airline preference on the first page before the app starts to load the flights. Thanks :)"
2016,3,Loved this app the way it was!!! I don't like the update on this app. Can't visibly see cost of flights and set days without pressing it first. You use to be able to see the cost of flights going on different days. Not impressed. Bring back the old style app.
2016,3,Used to be really good but the latest version appears to be somewhat buggy regularly saying retry when populating the flight search list. This is not a network issue on my side. Searching for direct flights also used to be very easy but is now a chore.
2016,1,"Updates yet again ruin a great app. Over complicated, long winded searches and constant false prices! After 5 years I'm deleting for good!"
2016,3,"Made several searches and when forwarded websites the prices are never the same. And it's not just a couple of euros, it's a lot more.  Is this some problem or it's normal?"
2016,3,"Not been away for a few years due to babies. However, you used to have a map that users could quickly scan between possible departure and destination locations. Where is the map now? This was an amazing feature..."
2016,3,"There is no easy way to get results only for direct flights. You need to get all results and after it fully loads, apply a filter for direct flights, which is very cumbersome. The results shown are good but sometimes there is a slight increase in price when you actually want to book it."
2016,2,What on earth have you done? You literally murdered the android app! I can't even look for the cheapest month option anymore. Such a waste of time. I'm back on the Web browser website.
2016,2,There's no option to turn off these obnoxious push notifications. I like the app I barely use it but now I'm getting these and I can't turn them off. I'd rather uninstall the app and reinstall each time I use it.
2016,5,"It was an amazing App! Last update just changed everything: usability is not intuitive, app performances decreased and we are missing a lot of Key functions."
2016,5,The best ever app that give you the best price with no hidden charges.. This app never let me down. üëç
2016,5,"My family often traveling, this apps really help us to booking ticket at last minute. We have crazy price"
2016,4,Very nice to see an app that lets you explore different places you can travel. Love the discovery and call out to direct flights.
2016,5,Great way to keep up to date on the cheapest flights in specific days in the go. Makes for a wonderful escape in searching possibilities of future travels.
2016,5,Sky scanner just got even better. Booking on your mobile is a piece of cake. Thanks guys
2016,1,"no cheap flights. it shows only the expensive fares. no currency option, stuck with british pounds."
2016,5,I typically use Google flights and have found this to be comparable.  It would be cool to see the lowest price for the same flights regarding different currencies.
2017,5,I've been using this app for a couple of years... So far is the best one to find cheap prices on flights...
2016,2,Where is the fare calender? Changing any setting you need to go all out. Not intuitive anymore.
2016,4,Its me the lowest prices possible. I used other apps but this is pretty good.
2016,4,Easy to use...great for last minute travel.. If stuck somewhere perfect use...
2016,5,Book all my flights using this app. From my summer holidays to a few days away..
2016,2,New interface is clumsy and awkward to use. Older versions were better.
2016,3,"Trying to fly from DC to Vancouver on the way there, Portland to DC on way back. Can't do that option. Where's the multi-city option?"
2016,4,Easy to work with but I found that one of the referred agencies pulled a bait and switch on me and was non responsive when I tried to contact them.  eDreams
2016,5,I got my flight 300 dollars cheaper than I was expecting to pay! Very happy
2016,5,"it helps to find low fair flights, not only the single destination , it works around the world"
2016,5,"Thanks for this app, I was able to save hundreds on my travels."
2016,4,It's a good application. .. where as it have a pop up when rates go down  .. I like this app
2016,5,"Best flight app, most up to date on prices"
2016,2,"I put on filters and it doesn't find any flights. When i go to individual airline sites or other sites, my flight is available."
2016,3,"Unable to filter out airlines like Spirit, who I would never fly."
2016,4,Best of all the online shopping stores.I like it very much and also recommend all to use this app
2016,4,Very flexable.  Lets me know the costs and I choose from there.
2016,5,"Multiple vendors, airlines etc searched seamlessly and the best rates put forward. Simple. Brilliant."
2016,4,"Very easy to use, I really love it especial for domestic flights."
2016,5,"Its good.You can find almost all available airlines, even rotana jet which is not available on other sites."
2016,5,Awesome app gets you the best prices I've used this app multiple times over the years never failed me
2016,4,Need to add rayani air as well for malaysia airlines.
2016,4,Easy to look for flights filtered according to your preference
2017,4,please enable multi city search from the app for international flights
2016,4,Easy to use and got best deal on this app.
2016,5,"Thanks for a great, speedy and much so convenient app :)"
2016,5,"Very easy to use, loads of options, very flexible, god I'm diving in joyness"
2016,5,The wonderful app gives very easy access to all details required
2016,5,I use this app for find filght to everywhere. It good to use every day.
2016,4,Thanks for your efforts its really useful
2016,3,"Kayak still much better, and cheaper"
2016,5,Love being able to have it as a widget on my screen!
2016,5,My go to app when I fly..very helpful!!
2016,5,It would be great if you give some special discount
2016,5,Can look up any destination and the improvements are fantastic
2016,5,Easy to use and does what it needs to do without complication!

2016,5,Grt app
2016,5,:-)
2016,1,"I can't understand why you changed completely the app, before it was so easy and quick to use, now there are many step and stuff to click and it is so difficult to find direct flights option, or even to swap the flight to find the return flight itself. I used to love this app and now I hate it."
2016,5,Simply the best App and MUST HAVE App if you are traveller or backpacker.
2016,5,"Along with one way and return fair, please add multi city option as well.."
2016,5,Kudos
2016,3,How to disable the multiple airlines options? I think the previous design is easier to use.
2016,5,I don't rate many apps but this thing is great
2016,5,Gives useful info to plan holiday
2016,4,"Found the app in a Suduko game.. ""Everything you about Skyscanner"" ... Check your adds people !!     Otherwise its great : )"
2016,5,Its easy to use and it gives a lot of options depends on ur needs.
2016,5,"Easy, fast & convenient....I'm in love!"
2016,4,I love this application
2016,5,Couldn't be easier or better to use
2016,5,Very easu
2016,5,Good
2016,4,Skyscanner flights
2016,1,"Skyscanner devs, it is clear that you are NOT listening to app users because nearly 98% of all ratings after the update are 1 or 2 stars. If you are listening, return the app to how it was before the update, then do improvements a little bit at a time. If you continue on this course, you will lose many old customers and ALL new ones. Who is going to dl an app with all 1 stars and negative reviews? Stop with the canned responses to comments too. They make things look even worse."
2016,2,"I am what's known as a frequent flyer and have used Skyscanner since the early days. I just went to install it on a new Android phone and noticed all the poor reviews. My  curiosity got the better of me so I had to  check it out. I'm sorry to say that the reviews are right. It really is not a good experience now. In fact, for the flights I had to book today I went to the app for Windows phone, which is still clean and works well. Sorry but it's thumbs down from me."
2016,1,"The new iteration of your app is just bad UX, bad UI and design all around. The search options are harder to access, the results list harder to read. There is a clear lack of grid and general content organisation. There is no real contrast anymore so also very hard to read. I wish I had not upgraded. Epic fail!"
2016,1,"I used to love this app. I rated this app before and the developer said that we're going to do more updates. I almost never rate the apps  unless I really love them or hate them.  I tried the update and now I would like to drop to 1 star You're bar graph now is terrible, interface is difficult.  POSSIBLY if somebody   could just read the comments from your followers you might figure it out.  All you had to do was work on accuracy of your results.  I used to tell somebody about your app every day, now none."
2016,1,"If you loved Skyscanner's great search features and user friendliness, do not update. Features removed, common work flows take way more clicks, weird non-standard UI decisions. I've never left a review of an app until now, but I feel compelled to express my frustration that a 5 star app turned into a 1 star app in one update."
2016,2,"This version is terrible. UI is very clumsy. The dates selected don't seem to be saved when checking flights to possible destinations so you have to keep re-selecting them over and over. For users who know their exact destination, maybe this is OK, but for those frequently selecting flights to Everywhere, this app is disappointing. It's easier to manually search your destinations using Kayak now."
2016,1,"It was previously very easy to see prices at a glance far in advance. which would allow for easily planning trips. Now it's time consuming and you have to choose date and cross your fingers that it is the lowest price since it's just a green dot to tell you you're within a ""fair price range"" now. When using the bar option it's no better, you have to seek out the lowest bar visually. It doesn't give you a ""hint price"" with a line extended as it previously did."
2016,1,"I had for 5 year this app in apple device! Just yesterday i bought an Samsung s6 and i download all application that i had in iphone... the worst is this app? Is completly different , is impossible to swap the destination... the graphic is very bad! Why is so difficult made a 1 app for all device? 1 star becouse for find a cheaper price here is very hard... whit iphone is 1000000 time better! I wanted change phone becouse is 3 iphone that i broken with water... samsung is waterproof."
2016,1,"Please please bring back the previous version! I used to love and use  skyscanner exclusively (we are on year 2 of rtw travel) but this update has been extremely painful to use. If you just needed a new look, it could have been done without changing the architecture--unless it was for the better. This is not better."
2016,3,"I have used Skyscanner for a long time and found this latest update confusing, I'm not a fan of the calendar view with the dots and it wasn't obvious how to see the bar chart. I've figure out how to see it but because the calendar is the default view I always have to press it which is annoying. Please tell your developers to allow this preference to be saved in the next update, I think it will make a lot of your users happy who prefer the old search. Thanks!"
2016,3,"I use this app on a daily basis & I honestly think that you should just downgrade back to the former version. It was much simpler, quick, & user friendly. But now too many useless images with complicated interface. Though this app will always be my favorite, absolutely love it."
2016,1,"Much worse than the older version. Too many steps, too many images, not streamlined. Not possible to look for multiple flights. I am a heavy user.I am using the classic version/website nowadays.  To that I would give 4.5 stars any day of the week.  As we say in Romania,  you just blew your nose in the perfect bean soup."
2016,2,"This used to be a great app for finding deals with flexible travel dates.  Your changes destroyed what was good and unique about this app.  If I wanted to play guess the departure date, i would use Kayak or Travelocity.   Way to destroy a great product. I'm unistalling.  Too bad, I bet I told 2 dozen people about your old app.  It was great."
2016,2,"I found a flight through Expedia for an amazing price on the app, but when I went to cross-check it on the website, the flight wasn't listed. I know this app gives you the option to book the flight from your phone, but it felt way too sketchy for me. I also needed to look for a multi-city flight, but it seems that's not an option."
2016,1,New version doesn't let you select flight times as easily & search results are full of horrid 4am red eye flights.  Screens are cluttered. Pushes you to select country then airport rather than jump straight to airport. Was my previous default flight search engine will probably go elsewhere now.
2015,2,"I use this app very frequently and have done for many years.  I find the updated version much more effort to use.  Instead of being able to put your search data in on one page,  it's now a series of around 5 pages. So time consuming. It's turned from a great simple,  quick app, to an overly complicated one with too many superfluous steps."
2016,3,"The search results display is horrible. Expedia's list of flights shows the airports that the flights connect to, which makes it much easier to focus on OPEN airports (versus SkyScanner's method of requiring that I click on each result to see the connecting airports). Sure, it isn't a frequent need, but IS a need nonetheless."
2016,1,"Went on this app after upgrade.  Immediately thought what now???   Came on here to predict all the complaints and i wasn't wrong.    Seriously! Change it back! It's impossible to use and not user friendly in the slightest.   Will use the quote many a person have used.....""if it aint broke, don't fix it"" u can IMPROVE but don't change it completely. Madness lol"
2016,1,Rubbish following update! It used to be my go to app for buying tickets but recent changes have made the app unusable. Bring back the old version or I'm un installing it (as I suspect many have done already)
2016,3,I'm using OnePlus One. New update I can't even use back button. Either on screen button or the apps back button. I have to force close the apps in order to make a new search or modify my search parameter. Its a huge disappointment for me. It was awesome previously
2016,2,"Was extremely useful and easy to use :-( but nowadays, not even close to what was once! Many possible connections do not appear. Low cost airlines, only found them suggested on possible direct flights. Best cheapest option suggested a second ago... ‚Ç¨700... 43hours! Low cost option I know exists ‚Ç¨250... 10hours! :-("
2016,3,What have you done to this app? I thought updates were supposed to make things better. It was a 5 star app & much easier to use before. I've been using it for years & told many people about it. It's like a completely different app to the last time I used it.
2016,3,Many people don't have the pressure to flight in a specific date...we are asking for the unique feature of Select 2 or 3 weeks to Departure and 2 or 3 weeks for Return to choose ...instead of the limited 1 day Select to Go and 1 day select to Return that the app is giving us ...and once done the alert on your email box until the user stopped because have selected the best price
2016,2,"....Don't Fix It! By a mile, this was the best Flight search App around. It was also the easiest on the eye. Now we have small  text on a white background ... and it is unnecessarily cluttered. Having said that I have every confidence that the layout will soon be back to where it neefs to be :-)"
2016,2,This used to be a great app to easily find lowest prices without entering travel dates.  Thats what made the app Great.  I could check rates all year long and plan several trips.  I dont even see all the airlines that it used to show. Allegient Air was almost always the lowest fares.  Now they dont even show up.
2016,2,I use this app a lot! I loved the older simpler version. Now it's too time consuming. Too many different pages and trying to compare prices for a whole month and direct flights has gone too complicated. Please fix
2016,1,Please bring back the old version. This app is a tool. Ease to use always come first. Fancy looking won't help me searching the info I want. I need a simple and easy to use app. Look at the review of the first few pages. Please bring back the old version.
2016,1,I tried this based on a recommendation. Put info in to tack a specific flight and it never gave me any updates. Now the flight is 200 more. Would have purchased last... really disappointed now I have to pay more then anticipated
2016,3,"This was the best app for finding flights listed with colorful easy bar charts, but the new update (coupled with the untimely rise in airline flights) messed it all up. I loved the old Skyscanner app. RIP. It was fun while it lasted."
2016,1,New updated version of this app is terrible. It has become over complicated and difficult to use. The free flowing easy browsing excellent old app has been completely overhauled and replaced with this. I booked flights through the old app but I wouldn't bother trying with this new version. Sort it out.
2016,1,"I am trying to put in where I am departing from, and it isn't working. I put the ""city, code to the airport, United States"" (as it shows in the picture) and nothing. Just shows a blank screen. I even put just the code in and still nothing. Phone LG V10."
2016,4,Very useful & convenient esp when one lives abroad. Love how it shows you when the most expensive time to book flights to your destination with colour Co ordination!! Pity about non mobile friendly options that come up though!
2016,1,"What happened? New update. Punch in cities and dates from graph, after that it just stops there. I cant check out the different pricings of that day from different scource. Used to able on previous updates"
2016,2,"The whole point i liked this app was that it gave you the prices of the day i wanna fly right in the search box, now i have to search over and over to find a price for that day, i might as well save the space on my phone and use a regular site. It was good while it lasted üòû"
2016,1,The last version was much better and easier to use. I'm still waiting an interface with the opportunity to search only weekends. 0 intuitive. I gave 1 star because I have to..
2016,5,"This app has a great overall overview, quick to view prices, dates etc. Easy to use, press 1 button done, press another done. Easy to understand and finds always great deals. U can create alerts for price changes too!"
2016,3,"It's a great concept but the data can be buggy. A long range search reveals some months have 'no data'. So is that an airline problem or an app Issue? As I'm an ex airline employee, my guess is that it's likely the app."
2016,2,I used the old version on a daily basis. I used to search for the while month and now cannot work out how to do that. I find it easier to go in via the internet and use the website rather than the app :-(
2016,1,"Loved the app prior to new updated, new update is unnecessary complicated almost to the point it's messy. Found myself downloading other apps but even they no comparison to original app. Please update consider rolling back"
2016,1,"Old version  was easy and simple to use. Now it has small font and is  tedious to use,  they removed some of the best screen design and replaced it with a frustrating interface. Too much hassle to use."
2016,1,I use to love this app . But the update is not user friendly . It is a mess and not easy on the eye. I found myself getting irritated using it. Why do you have to break one of the best apps around?
2016,5,"Simple to use, no issues on HTC One M8, very smooth and a lot of detail/information is displayed in an easy way to understand. Couldn't have made it simpler/easier to book a flight. Very ergonomical."
2016,2,"Searches and bookings made via skyscanner website allows multi-city flights. However in app, only round-trip and one-way options available. Would appreciate if developer could add a multi-city option."
2016,1,"What a disaster, complicated, extra steps, unclear, reduced search options.  Never commented before on an app, but how can you get it so wrong.  Used this for years and always recommended, looking for an alternative now sadly."
2016,1,The upgrade is poor! The app is difficult to use and the flight prices are always out dated.. The old app was excellent and I don't understand why the developers tried to fix what wasn't broken!
2016,1,Use to be great - the update has totally ruined it. Previously you could travel to or from 'everywhere' to find cheapest price to an undecided destination; now you need to specify your departing/returning airport.
2016,1,Rarely go back to review an App after an update but I'm so unimpressed I felt I had to. Ability to search for direct flights has gone along with unfriendly interface. Why the upgrade??
2016,5,"Absolutely love this app. I find amazing deals. One of my favorite resources. Keep up the good work! I don't care who makes money, as long as I save some."
2017,2,"Used to be great. Trying to search flights to a smaller airport in California from the UK  and it says there's no flights - seriously??? Can go on Google and get them,  no problems. LAME"
2016,5,Does everything well. I don't need any other app for my flight booking. I particularly like the fact that you can do everything in your home currency; this function doesn't seem to be available on the version for Windows Phone.
2016,1,"Now pretty much unusable, crashes regularly, buttons don't work, user interface not very easy to use. Can we have the old version back?"
2015,2,Once you sign in the app changes. On the trial version it displayed dots with price range.  I don't like the format of the date nor the military time
2016,5,"I rate it 5 becouse its a great app , one of the best , but i have to say last update is a total disaster. It doesent find all best routs anymore ,like iff you are looking for a direct flight it shows you the expensive ones and iff you are looking for return aswell its going to find you cheaper ones."
2016,2,This app seems to have changed significantly and I'm not sure if it's for the better. I'm not receiving any alerts for my watched flights even though I've set them up in skyscanner and the prices have changed since then.
2016,5,Fantastic app in which it easy beats any other in the market. Have used for the last two years and booked many flights through them. Must have on any device i buy. Thanks guys !!
2016,2,"Used to love this app, would use it for all my flights. It's now become unnecessarily complicated. This update is definitely a backward step."
2016,5,"I've used this a lot to buy flights, a very useful app. Usually finds the cheapest fares out there. Recommended. No annoying ads. Thumbs up."
2015,2,The new update is horrendous!  It is far from user friendly. Now I go online or use your competitor. My friends who travel frequently agree.
2016,1,It used to be possible to pick out the cheapest flights over a period of several months helping you to choose which dates to go on holiday. When it's not broke don't fix it .
2016,5,"Best application, give lots of options at very cheap rate. I think it is better then all the other flight applications. Really appreciate. Keep it up"
2016,1,I used this app almost everyday. .The new version is so difficult to use...it's not user friendly!! I am now uninstalling the app!
2016,4,I'm new to this app so I may not have explored all possibilities as yet. Would like to separate the time frame between outgoing and return flight
2016,1,"Old version was great,could see the flights for the year,and chose the cheapest.This option has gone,you have to enter the dates,with no way find the cheapest."
2016,2,"Every time I choose flight I need to click ""1 way only"" , since ""return flight"" is always selected by default. I think it should be possible to have an option in a menu to select what type of flight should be the default one."
2016,3,"I'm missing the option for multi-stop flights. Otherwise it's a decent app, but I can't book anything on here until I'm able to book multi-stop."
2016,1,Used to love this app about it's great interaction and user friendliness. Now it's the opposite. Rollback to the previous version before it's too late!
2016,4,I like that it saves my filters. It'd be great if the widget could display my filtered searches. Otherwise it'd give it 5 stars.
2016,1,Always loved and used this app until this update! They've spoilt it. To complicated now and no graph view any more
2016,4,Have been using this app for a long time now. I find the updated version more informing. Just now booked for a holiday to fiji.thanks skyscanner
2016,2,this new update is no good. when you press back it goes to the beginning and erases the dates and destination every single time. annoying. I want the old one back.
2016,2,"The old version was so nice, fast, and easy to use. This new one is confusing and difficult to use. The old Skyscanner app was THE app to use. The new one, not so much."
2019,2,it used to be great now it is useless every time I set up a search alert... I get emails with the itinerary or search alert changed. don't like it anymore
2016,1,Last version was 10 times better..This is pure terrible...And they save your iPhone information go jack up the price later...Not good at all..
2015,1,"Will be using the website instead. The app became unusable crap. Thanks developers -  ""good job""!"
2016,2,"Before, you could see lowest prices per day. Now it only shows one day. It's become an Expedia type of app. No bueno."
2016,5,Really good choice of flights that are a great value for money. Also a really nice easy app layout. One of my main priority apps and a must for travelers
2016,1,Awesome App! But bring back the old version. The new app sucks in many ways. Not user friendly at all!
2016,1,This app now does the same as any other flight checker. It has lost it's ease of use completely and its unique selling point.
2016,3,I really liked the widget of the old version. You could save a flight and watch the price each time you look at your phone. It was right in your face and constantly updated. Can you bring it back?
2016,2,Can't move the app to SD card. UI is much worse. Will stay with PC version. Fix it
2016,3,Samsung Galaxy Note2. It would be great if we can save our favorite trips and price alert with flexible days. Thanks
2015,3,I felt the previous versions were more user friendly I find it a little more of an effort to find my flights. I do like that you can see the cheapest months at a glance.
2016,4,I am unable to find a Multicity option for searching flights! It would be great if you could add it in the app! üòá
2016,2,This updated version is not good i these this app daily now I found it harder to use and see the monthly fares to Compare the prices wish u didn't update it now!
2016,1,"Wife told  me,  do not upgrade,  u be sorry!!.  Ant she was dead right.  Why,  whyyy!!!  It was good,  simple app to use,  now is too complicated. just making nervous always when using."
2016,5,Can't believe I waited so long to check this so out... Much better than a lot of other apps and most websites that I use for researching flights.
2016,2,I use this app quite often. The old version was so much more straightforward and easy to use. This new version is definitely not an improvement.
2016,1,App worked great until recent updates. It's really hard to use now. Not very inituitive.
2016,5,Did what I wanted ... found what I wanted got the deal I wanted and struck the deal direct with the airline cheaper after finding a flight.. will use again for long haul
2016,5,I have had no problems in using this app. Works for me and gives a comparison of different travel agencies in seconds. Good app.
2016,5,"Very easy to search flights. Plus, it color-codes the flight calendar so you can spot cheap flight days at a glance."
2015,5,"Very reliable app I use every time to buy my tickets. Also offering very competitive price, sometimes the cheapest price you may find. Also you can set reminder to alert you in case of price dropped or getting even higher"
2016,1,"I used to be using the old app daily for booking flights for me and many others but the with the recently update, it's so bad that I never useskyscanner anymore!!"
2016,2,The quotes I get are always for return flights so to compare I have to go to each destination and each date and manually select one way. Why can't it let me default searches to one way only?
2016,2,Why did you have to change the app. .its rubbish now. .it was so easy to follow before now is just all over ther place and no where near as straight forward !!! üò†üò†üò†
2016,5,Great app! Provides heeps of information on range of airlines and their prices! BUT one problem there is no provision for muslim meal!
2016,1,Older version worked well. Foolishly updated and will probably uninstall. Cannot use and I am an experienced it professional.
2016,5,"Great APP but crashing on Android 6.0.1;                                  Edit: last update seems to have fixed it, changing to 5 stars."
2016,1,"Why changing? The interface was reliable and simple to use, now it's way more complicated and time consuming!"
2016,1,"Before the update, I could very easily switch airports, now I literally have to clear my cache & my app data just to change airports! This update RUINED the app for me!"
2016,5,Use this app all the time. Love how you can view the whole month and select the cheapest fare. Also having the nearby airports displayed is great instead of having to go back to the search page. Recommend to anyone.
2016,1,I used to love it and used every time for flight bookings. Now its useless and crashes all the time. Design is completely OTT
2016,5,"It works fast, has friendly interface. Saves your search. This app really helpful and saves your money."
2016,5,"I always start here,  i literally found RT from PDX TO LAS $44... I am a real person and use it all the time ...rarely do they not have the cheapest. Start here"
2016,1,This app used to be great as was able to look at a full month and see which was cheapest day to fly. Not able to do that anymore. I guess this was a huge reason people downloaded this app.
2016,2,Prices are definitely higher than booking from airline website. Not all airlines that serve a particular destination is shown.
2016,5,It's very easy and I got a plans for the next vacation with all family... Thank you sooooo much Skyscanner...mwaaah
2016,2,Newest update makes it harder to find cheap flights. Never had a problem before this. Really disappointed.
2016,2,Since you've changed the layout of the app I find it very difficult to search for flights. So i just use the Web version.
2016,1,The new version is really frustrating and complicated to use!!! The view is not very friendly. Please provide option to get the older version!!!
2015,3,"Great app and it's saved me loads, but recently I've been looking at flights and the price displayed in the app is about ¬£10 different when I try and book."
2016,4,Great for option selection. For last return flight got lower price though by booking direct with airline online.
2017,1,I originally gave it 5 stars but now you cannot search for the whole month. Lost its use for me. Booo
2016,5,"I love this app, I go on here at least once a day to check for tickets. Nothing else compares to these prices!"
2016,2,Used to be good. After I updated the new version the price has gone up about ¬£120 . ridiculous
2016,2,Compared to the website. I understand the USA don't recognize Cuba but that doesn't mean flights don't exist.
2016,5,A great flight search app. Easy to understand and genuine search results. Booked a flight this week using it.
2016,1,New update is absolutely appalling.. go back to the old version.. awful
2016,5,"A good reference. I would suggest to confirm prices directly with the agencies/airlines, before you book."
2016,4,Easy app to find flight price and a good time to travel. I liked the app better before the update.
2016,4,"Works perfectly for planning your travels, gives you most options possible very quickly!"
2016,5,It does well what it says! Would be good if you could plan a trip with several destinations...
2016,5,"Very simple & easy to use. Best prices, great flight info and no hidden fees."
2016,5,Skyscanner is easy to use and even includes flights on Southwest. While it is simple to use for beginners even more savvy travelers can use it to find the best deals
2016,1,Why did you change this? It used to be so simple. Its the simple things that work best. Using another app now.
2016,4,Great app. Give right information.i always book my family tickets through sky scanner.
2016,3,Earlier there was an option that shows prices on every date which was very helpful. Now there are only colours which when selected gives a prices which is higher than many more websites.
2016,1,Its more basic with less functions it seems. Looks nice but the older version worked better.
2016,4,Would get 5 stars if it had options such as one way economy and return in business etc. Book all my flights through this app
2016,3,This App definitely needs to include ALL airlines!  It lacks SOUTHWEST airlines in its search results!! It's therefore incomplete.
2016,1,This app was by far my most used app. This update is horrible and has ruined it. PLEASE fix it.
2016,4,why you dont add the Multiple flights options to this app. it will be so much easier and nicer.
2016,1,There no Canadian airline company if I trusted this app completely I would have paid more for my trip .because it do not take in account Canadian airline company
2016,4,"Smart features, great UI and best prices. UX could be better."
2016,4,Great for checking prices! Wish I could pick flight times independently but you can set parameters pretty easily.
2016,5,Easy to use I've booked more than 5 flights untill now. I'm lovin it
2016,4,Easy. But needs an anywhwre selection. I want a cheap flight somewhere im not always concerned with where.
2016,4,Great app for price alerts.  But book fast. Prices can change quickly.
2016,3,Until you don't add multi-stop flights Google Flights is beating you to the core.
2016,5,"After trying 2 other apps above 4 stars, decided to stick with this user friendly app. The other 2 apps were not at all user friendly and surprised they got 4 stars, at the end of the day it is trail and error process."
2016,3,I can Always count on good flight deals with Skyscanner. And its functionality is quick and easy
2016,1,"It was intuitive, fast, reliable. Now is unnecessarily complicated. I want the old one back!"
2016,2,"It takes your ip info, and it gives you more costly prices when you ask the price later..."
2016,5,"Much more fluent to use now. Takes getting used to after using the old one for so long, but a step in the right direction."
2016,4,"Nice search engine for flight booking, kindly add options for blocking of flights and if it is already available do please let me know"
2016,1,"Old app could search between countries for cheapest flights (i.e. United Kingdom to Germany), now I can't. Why?"
2016,5,I like very trusted app help me to find my best deals and no extra charge on the final price
2016,1,This new update is useless now. Especially the part when choosing the dates & it shows those bars of prices
2016,4,Works very efficiently and gives options for different dates. Also recommends destinations
2016,5,If it included a refresh rate for the widget.  Even better!  :).
2016,5,A good app to schedule your trip...  Enjoy the vacancy with cheap tickets.
2016,4,I Love this! But the price alert still not in my currency even though I change the setting
2016,5,That is awesome. New app is very helpfull. Thanks
2016,3,The app helps me find some really good flights and especially last minute flights but they don't show all flights and the flights are more expensive on skyscanner
2016,1,"The new update is totally pathetic,  never understand it so finally deleted app. Before it was my one of fvt app but the update ruined this."
2016,5,Love it ! It actually work's. Like the layout and so easy to use. Top marks from me
2016,5,Just such a nice n easy flow to this app. Tks to the dev team. Really great work. Gl
2016,5,Amazing app and service. Use them every time I need to book a flight.
2015,5,Useful app. Easy to use. Thank you :)
2016,3,"Better than the web search, should be easier to change airports. Be nice if it defaulted to direct flights."
2016,5,Love this app. Remembers previous searches. Alerts me to price changes. On the mobile is great for on the go searches.
2016,5,App makes good use of material design. Easy and intuitive navigation.
2016,4,Great app. Always gave best deals
2016,4,I wish there was a setting where I could set which times during the day I want to travel. Otherwise it's a very nice and clean app
2017,1,Advertised hotels for low rates. Sent you to the hotel website where the rates were either much higher or rooms unavailable.
2016,1,"What happened to all the flexibility options, such as +/- 1 or 2 days. Used to be easier"
2016,5,Amazing. So easy and so good. For me is the best. Years I'm using this app
2016,4,Easy to use and great for comparing flight times and prices.
2016,5,Great app lots of options.....very helpful... Thanks

2016,1,Who's the change old version disgusting features new version to much confused change this version and get back old version
2016,5,User friendly and very helpful. I recommend!
2016,1,"Totally awful this update has ruined a once great app, complicated, confusing, this is a lesson in how to destroy a company."
2015,2,Don't like the new calender. How do I see prices for everyday of the month like the old app?
2016,5,It has many user friendly options for better matching of prices which is cool.
2016,4,Booking is easy. But still can get tickets little cheaper elsewhere
2016,4,Older app much easier to see at a glance. Newer app better for buying tickets
2016,5,Nice deals! Easy to use! Great App!
2016,5,Very helpful. I depend on it in all my travel plans.
2016,4,Has everything you need and easy search parameters.  Excellent for quick cost estimates.

2016,5,"Great UI, good features and best search results."
2016,5,I travel a lot and this is the only app I use to find my flights.
2016,1,When searching for flights I've found through airlines own websites Skyscanner comes up with nothing...
2016,5,Works smooth and organizes really well! Love it
2016,5,Really like this app to search for cheapest flights for a route!
2016,4,Good apps. Easy to use. Simple easy and convenient.
2016,4,Cheapest I've seen. Thank you
2016,5,Very well design. So great to be able to see all the destinations when you don't know where to go :)
2015,3,Estimates are very far off. Unfortunate bc this app has a lot of potential.
2016,1,"Though the price was shown as rs.7884,but on redirecting to payment page price got changed to rs.23220"
2016,4,The application is nice but it does not have the option for multi city search  Can I know when you will add it ??
2016,4,Good app But do not make bookings through this. Do it from the airline website.
2016,4,"Has a few wish list wants, but very helpful app for searching regionally"
2016,4,"Though results aren't accurate, app is a great starting point to search for deals on airline tickets."
2016,1,I can't stand to use the new app so complicated compared to old version
2016,4,"Good app, works for me with no big issues, have used it for years now."
2016,1,Hate and will not be using this version until it's been rolled back.
2016,1,Used this for years...now struggling to navigate around it...not clear anymore at all
2016,4,"Only improvement I can suggest is ability to search from Everywhere to a destination, to see best departure airport."

2016,5,I don't get the bad reviews. I find the app great and easy to use.
2016,4,"Very good, some of the text is to small could improve a little on UX with bigger text/buttons"
2016,4,Simple to the point would be five stars if it had a Multicity option
2016,4,The old way was better because i could choose my flight times
2016,4,There is no multi track for the option such as depart from US but difference province with arrival route.

2015,1,"I used to love this app but the most recent update made things so much harder. It looks better but I'd rather have better functionality. I couldn't even find how to do a full month search like in the past. Can't believe it. In going to try and find an older apk and hopefully get the old version back. *Update"" the latest version of the app crashes when using the ""everywhere"" search option and adder competing a search the back arrow on the top doesn't work. Have to force close the app and restart. Phase fix."
2015,3,"This is a fun app, that does on a phone most of what Kayak does, with sliders and whoknowswhat. It's fast, and seems complete. Includes SWA which Kayak does not. BUT people! Direct is not what you mean. You mean NON STOP. Get it right. Also, First and Business should not be separate and generate separate lists. I would rather choose #notcoach and have the app show me everything. So I don't have to search twice. Both of these suggestions mean I'm too old. But get it right!"
2015,1,Absolutely loved Skyscanner up until the recent update. Now has a completely non user friendly interface which is really confusing and turns a simple 1 minute search into a 10 minute search trying to figure out what all the menus do!! Will now use kayak as my simple search tool from now on. Really let down with this update :(
2015,1,Can't understand why you app developers keep changing things that work so well. My options to travel are always open but the grid view is no longer an option. Keep having to change search dates to find cheapest day to fly. Won't be using again until grid view returns.
2015,4,Please follow the start screen design used for the iPhone app (takes going past 3 pages to see the prices!). Please add feature to add flight as calendar entries (similar to iPhone app). Also option to quickly change billing country along with currency would be great
2015,5,"I like the easy UI this app provides, but sometimes when I use the chart to compare prices especially for multiple airlines, it doesn't show the price except if highlighted. Would've been great if you could include multicity flights as well. Overall a good app and highly recommended for frequent flyers and travellers."
2015,5,*update*     I figured it out. I was just going it wrong.                                                                                                                                              I can search flights but that's it.  It'll show me the list of months and the lowest price per month but I can't do anything with it.  I've looked all over.  I can't find a place to actually choose a flight and book it. I'll give it 5 stars as soon as I get that part going.
2015,4,Great app. Only way to book flights! Just please add a duration filter to widgets so I can filter out 50hr flights I am never going to take!
2015,5,"Faster than most of the applications out there. Give amazing insights on flights. Like shortest duration flight, 2nd one and so on. Aso alerts on flight prices.  The best feature i found was search anywhere from a destination."
2015,1,Gives false information. Promises direct flights even such does not then exist. Does not find existing direct flights. How many other such bugs there are? Will destroy your plans.
2015,5,You want to go somewhere but don't know who to fly with? This is the app for you. Gives you all the flight options to your chosen destination and costs taxes included. I have used this site for years and really love this app
2015,5,A great way of searching and finding the best and cheapest flight rates. Very intuitive to use plus amazing notifications. Has been my primary go to app for flight bookings
2015,2,"Used this App all the time until the update. Use to be very easy to navigate, now it's very fussy and I end up looking for flights elsewhere."
2015,1,"The app shows you one price, but when you tap on the flight to show more details or buy the flight the price will change by a significant amount. Pretty pointless to use if you're not going to quote the correct prices initially."
2015,4,Best apps to get the better flight deal...I would prefer an notification on my phone rather than an email when the prices are going down...
2015,5,Perhaps the best app for quickly finding out the cheapest and most convenient flying options. Multiple filters to help design an optimum traveling experience and very user friendly to use!
2015,5,"I liked your app. Alerts help so much in order to buy more cheap. Very fast, simple to use. Recommend to everyone who likes to fly"
2015,5,"Very clear, bright design. Allows you to search for one-way or round-trip tickets according to date, price, airlines, and number of stops. Haven't bought anything yet but seems promising!"
2015,4,"Useful app and the best in market for search flies, but why I cann't find any more flies by all month, not by specific date, please fix it."
2015,5,Super easy user interface. Having the ability to see a window of prices in a calendar format is awesome.
2015,5,"I used this app to find the best price for a round trip flight from Chicago to Ercan, Cyprus and it yielded the best prices for sure!  I recommend using this app to search for ANY international flight!"
2015,5,Superb arrangement of cheap air fares to costly air fares..                                       Unique apps with all airlines than any other apps..                                             üòç this app
2015,5,Very accurate & update frequently... searches are fast and app is very easy to use.
2015,5,This has to be the easiest and user friendly app around. I can find any flight in seconds.
2016,1,Just use the website. Works a lot better and shows more information.
2015,5,This app isvthe best travel app i have ever used. No need to check pricing on other sites because it's already been done.
2015,2,UI is worse than before. So confusing to use.
2015,1,Good idea but about 3/4 of all dates don't have any data.
2015,1,Please change back older version..new version hard to see best offer price.
2015,4,This app is so easy & helpful! You enter your search then you can set an alert and it searches for you.
2015,5,very useful tool... two thumbs up...
2016,5,It's the best app for reviews prices and dates of flights.
2016,1,And forget the app. This was once a fantastic app.. Was...
2015,3,"The older version was easy n simple to use, this one takes time to get used to."
2015,1,Momondo app finds much cheaper flight than Skyscanner...
2015,5,Easy to use. Great deals!
2015,4,This is nice app for travel but site map is bit confusing to manage your bookings.
2015,4,Love it it gives you updates when flights change awesome app to have cheap prices
2015,4,Very useful app to get rates...recommend to couple of friends
2015,5,"Love at first use. Easy, fast and perfect for my needs!"
2015,5,Perfect selection for great ideas and new information. I used it often and it is really great.
2015,1,Home airport is ATL...can't compare the largest carrier.
2015,5,"Traveled to Egypt, got best fare.  Great app"
2015,4,Pity cannot choose a whole month in the calendar and see the prices per day
2015,1,Pathetic new interface the old one was simpler and userfriendly..the new one is very complicated
2015,5,I can be alerted of price change. Just wish buying tickets from unknown websites would be safer.
2015,4,Best comparison/notification app I have found!!
2015,4,Van mejorando en cada actualizaci√≥n por supuesto algunas veces tienes sus peros en los que ahora no caigo pero por ahora bien
2015,5,"I liked that small ball under the dates, showing which day is better to buy a ticket!"
2015,5,"Use it all the time for cheap weekend trips, great app dont change a thing!"
2015,5,Gives me comparisons IMMEDIATELY!!   THANKS!
2015,5,Love this apps.best compare price then other flight.keep it up skyscanner
2015,5,You can compare all the prices from all tour travel / flights in one application.
2015,5,"I always book on Skyscanner, always find the best value for money flights."
2015,5,Very usefull appliation for market survey gives the Lowest Price.
2015,5,"The best App, is always giving me the best rates and trips."
2015,5,Happy that a coworker introduced this app to me. I love it!
2015,4,Easy too find the where you want to go
2015,5,"Fab for a quick quote and easy to use, love it."
2015,5,It so convinient to use that in my opinion it is the best flight booking app.
2015,5,Easy to use....many currencies to view price....flexible
2015,5,The best app for booking cheaper tickets and comparing between airlines
2015,5,This app is so easy to use and mobile friendly to boot.
2015,5,Best App for searching different airlines in one place.
2015,5,Always the go to place for flight search at best prices!
2015,5,Fantastic app alerts when prices drop easy to book!
2017,5,"Love skyscanner, been using it for years!"
2015,5,Super streamlined.  Also seems to be cheaper then kayak.

2015,2,"Being an extensive user the last years on longer travels, this update is just bad. My need is to check for prices for many different routes in a fast way. Before, I had all my search options on one page. Now it's more wizard like, needing more interaction and costing more time. What's the benefit of the destination airport page? If u wanna show me cheaper months, show it beneath the single form as I select. Updates should simplify, not make it more complex. A visual refresh of the app would've be enough."
2015,1,"I'm confused why Skyscanner have decided to butcher their app with this new update. Can't select direct flights only until after the search is complete, you have to double click back just to change departure airport. It's bizarre that Skyscanner would remove these features. This is among other issues I can't remember as I've already uninstalled the app. Luckily Skyscanner have kept the mobile web interface minimal and easier to use so I will stick with that."
2015,2,"After the last update it's more difficult to use it, in my opinion and the font is too small (Samsung galaxy S6 edge. Also many of the economic airlines do not appear in the search results anymore. It is a big disappointed and I have no choice but to stop using it. There are other apps that search all the airlines, thus find cheaper tickets."
2015,2,It use to show the real price with everything included. With the 3rd party charges included in the list price. Now it's listed in small print underneath the price listed. So if I'm truly not saving anything I feel I should just go to the companies Web site. Deal with them directly. Because in case I had any hiccups I would have to deal with the 3rd party I booked through. When you book through the company they typically can work with you since you bought directly.I use to love this app. Not the same anymore
2015,2,"After the last update, it takes longer time on searching.  We cant select direct flight before click search.  And the calendar for cheaper tickets is not reliable as they r juz referring some 1 or 2 stops flights!  Can u give me back the last version??!!"
2015,1,The last big update ruined it all! I've always used this app because was so easy to find the cheapest fly. Now it doesn't show all the companies (Ryanair...) and it hasn't the comfy faster UI pre-update. Seems i'm not the only complaining about.
2015,1,Awful new design just awful please go back to old style. Why mess with something that's not broke. This new version looks horrible and is not as user friendly as last version. Guys seriously this is a big flop compared to your last outing what went wrong who on earth decided this was better????
2015,5,"A must have app for anybody that use Airlines on a regular basis. I particularly enjoy and like the alert function for flights you May want to use, and possibly get them at a cheaper price if the date is somewhat in the future by using alert feature. I have just read some of the responses to this app all I know that it save me a massive ¬£65. In my book that makes it a very worthwhile app to have on your phone or even your tablet."
2015,4,"Compared to airline websites, with Skyscanner I found tickets almost  50% cheaper!!! But do compare the ticket you're looking for with other flight apps before making your final decision.  In my case I did find my ticket cheaper through Skyscanner but on the process of searching I gad found cheaper flights with their competitors. However the search methods of this app are 5 star and compared to none! I love it!!"
2015,2,Is it possible to roll back to the previous version? This new UI is seriously a horrible horrible horrible design. I don't even review apps but I loved yours...until this update.
2015,1,One of the best apps ruined! Extremely disappointed. You've put trendy white space and loads of scrolling head of function and efficient screen use. Creating a search is long winded compared to previously. The old app was even better than the website.
2015,2,"Get the data correct and this will be a great ap. Love the pricing calendar and the monthly cost summary. Kayak still the best with regards to complete flight info, but lacks the pricing comparison tools of this so and others."
2015,1,I don't understand why you changed the app? It's harder to navigate and search. The website is much better as you can quick search to plan different routes. Such a shame as I use the app to search and book virtually all my flights.
2015,1,Latest update is so confusing loved this App before! Now it's easier to look through all the different Airline websites. Please change it back!
2015,2,"I just can use it if using wifi as connection, otherwise cannot use it. Bfore update, there is no problem. Hope fix it as soon ad possible."
2015,5,"Had a problem with an Airlines direct site prices not showing up anymore, emailed them and they fixed it right away. Fast, quick responses and listened. Thank you, keep up the great work!!!!"
2016,5,"Flights to uk/spain always get best flight details, no messing app and updates on prices on the days I want to fly."
2015,5,This app is my go-to app for cheap plane tickets. Price watch is a really neat feature to keep you posted on flights you want to keep track of.
2015,2,"Counter intuitive.  Hate it. Another example of another simple, perfectly functional app that turned crap by trying to be too much. Arghhhhhh!!!"
2015,2,"Went to booked a flight I finished and pushed purchase it came up with error, I think it's got something to do with the month when it asks for validation of card most cards have a zero in front of the single digit number but the app only has the single digit."
2015,4,This happens only with the webjet agent. Have been getting the same for every search result. Other than that a great app.
2015,4,The new interface is much clearer and easier to navigate through. Well done.
2015,2,Page cannot load. Been uninstal and re-do also. No use
2015,2,Where's  the option for multi centre flights? Disappointing.
2015,1,It's messy and less easy to use than before. Please change it back
2015,5,A proper flight search tool.  Highly recommend.
2015,4,Can improve in usability a bit.Seems the booking flow has increased few steps/taps.
2015,3,Can i searching for an open jaw / multi city ticket?
2015,5,"Best flight finder. Using everytime I wanna flight, recommending to everyone."
2015,4,"Didn't like the last update much, but still helps me a lot, love it!"
2015,5,"I can't find sometimes all connections, but most of the time prices are lower than Expedia or Opodo."
2015,4,Love the way it also pulls Southwest flight info too!!
2015,2,I preferred the way it woz ..why change and updated an app when it works perfect ..hate this now !! Arghh
2015,5,So far so good booked 3 flights so far very cheap and very easy to use first flight in a few days tickets printed so very good will be keeping this App
2015,5,"So far so good, definitely a much simpler & accurate way to find the best flights!"
2015,4,Es  muy buena aplicaci√≥n. No le doy 5 porque a veces he encontrado vuelos mas baratos en otra aplicaci√≥n
2015,5,App show the cheapest days to fly without pressing search. A good reference to compare other apps.
2015,1,New update is the worst thing that ever happened to Skyscanner.

2015,4,OK
2015,2,Payah
2015,5,Super
2015,5,Baap app
2015,5,Fly with skyscanner
2015,1,"I searched for more than 20 different destinations, multiple dates. Not a single flight found.  Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, nothing fixed the issue.  Clearly something is wrong.   Also liked the old ui much better. Will be using the Web version from now on."
2015,2,Why would you replace your brilliant previous app with this crap. So much more clunky and unreliable. I can't get any prices when i use the graph view. It just says not enough information... dreadful update and will definitely mean I'll be looking to use others instead. The old format app was the main reason i used to use skyscanner!
2015,2,"However, no matter what destination or date i choose it tells me no price is available. I have tried uninstalling etc but no flights come up! It's also not very user friendly. I used to rave about Skyscanner, now I'm not so sure it's the best out there. I can't work out how to make it work!"
2015,4,"Updated review: The layout is still different but it's also still a good place to find cheap flights so I gave it more stars.                                                        Oh well. Like all apps the developers couldn't just leave it alone. We all want to old look when looking up flight. Graph chart with the dates. I know there's a way to find it, but it should be the default. It just a used to be more functional, and now it's prettier. Prettier isn't always better."
2015,1,"Why did you take away multiple search windows? In the same window we used to be able to swap origin and destination, such a good feature gone.  Hate that you cannot select all the details, destination, dates, etc all on ONE page. Please please please bring back the original app with some minor improvements. How can I roll back to the previous version?"
2015,5,"100% works, great results and very close to the web version which is rare. Sometimes prices are a tad old but not often and after selecting it is revised so all good  :-) New app update is a little more complicated, would be nice to swipe along dates instead of having to go back a screen and reselect... Food for thought!"
2015,1,"Who in their right mind signed this off, what's worse is that despite 100's of negative comments you continue to have this as your current version.  Listen to what we are all SAYING,  and put it back to how it was.  I BET THE NEW APP FORMAT WAS DESIGNED BY A BLOODY GRADUATE"
2015,5,Sky scanner proved to be the best agent app in pocket. Helps planning easier. You helped airlines and people's life easier and economical. Defined in best way possible. I guess rating might cross 5 if any new updates are coming!
2015,2,"A dumbed down version of the site. Multiple screens to select routes, too much info on flights, taking up more screen room. It's just not worth the effort when there are better apps out there."
2015,2,Had to edit my review with the new update.  Dissapointed that the option to search for flights leaving before a certain time is gone. I only like to fly mornings and I cannot filter it to search for these now. Why remove a feature?
2015,2,Don't like the look of the latest version. Bring back the last one. Fix the bugs! Direct flights option keeps on turning off! Annoying.
2015,4,"twice uninstalled and reinstalled.To no avail.  Then I cleared all data, stopped the app running, de-installed and re-installed. And .. it seems to work  Have sent at least 5 crash reports to Google.  Impressed by your fast reaction.  Will change the rating."
2015,3,"The best feature of this app is the lowest price line on the bar graph, and now that has gone! Little green dots tell you very little whereas the lowest price line on the bar graph is a great visual price comparison.  Please bring it back."
2015,1,The new update ¬£439  .. old way of looking is ¬£49 to look for cheaper flights on different days.  This means it no different than any other holiday company now AVOID or be ripped off
2015,1,"Before you could search by the whole month and see prices for each day a flight was available. None of this anymore, preferred the old version!!! Uninstalling immediately!!!"
2015,5,Guy at the phone shop told me about it and I've been a happy customer for about 3 years. Always find a great deal... Just great for browsing for vacations sometimes as well.
2015,1,"Used Skyscanner app for years. Its been updated and is awful now. It doesn't flow at all and I don't like where you have to type your ""to"" and ""from"" in now either it is now badly designed."
2015,1,"I know tickets prices fluctuate, but this is a very bad estimation compared to my previous non update. It shows 299 at first, then after clicking into it, shows 495"
2015,2,"I previously rated this app as a 5 because it was easy to read and clear and concise, but used the new updated version today and I really don't like the new layout."
2015,5,"Thanks to the new design/surface, navigating the app has become much easier and new features have been added, that help you get where you want faster."
2015,1,"Used to have, after you input dates and destination, a useful graph search so you could see day by day the different prices workout having to manually change days every time.  Gone now."
2015,2,I used an older version on ios and just changed to android and this app is just not as clear and simple to use. I now only use skyscanner in browser now
2015,2,Used to love Skyscanner and always use the app. This new update has overcomplicated and made it harder to search for flights.
2015,4,Good app. The new vgn is lil complicated but as soon as u get used to it its fine ... Keep up the good work guys ..
2015,5,"Easy to use, awesome search features, saved searches, alerts, and the cheapest flights on the web! I've booked several flights on this."
2015,4,It was easier before. I wish you update it back to the old interface and thank you for amazing application.
2015,4,Goede tool. Maar er is soms een commisie boven op de prijs van bvb Ryanair.
2015,2,Says you can search all flights without specifics dates. It's just a typical flight search. Undownloading. Waste of space.
2015,2,I don't want a sleeping app to send me messages?! If i use it i know what i search for and an app that records my searches and sends me info is not helping!
2015,1,App kept crashing and couldn't log in too my mobile banking because of this app. Also not as good now the pricing graph has changed
2015,5,So very easy to use.. I have the best deals nothing hidden everytime.
2015,2,"Impossible to find anything! The monthly view is crap, please, go back to the previous version!"
2015,4,I would like to see More Airlines... I noticed that Southwest Airlines isn't on here I don't recall Delta... But I could be wrong
2015,5,Great app. It is easy to use and has a good environment. But I think it is better to include carrier information in detail section of each flight.
2015,4,Best deals on the app are no longer available. Otherwise good!
2015,5,"This is my ""go to"" flight  travel site. Really  impressed with the deals I can find."
2015,5,Found flights that before... would take hours.... thanks
2015,5,New app is still better. Provides great options to find the best flight
2015,1,Worst app. If cleartrip gives for 2500rs it gives for 7000. Too costly. Never try.
2015,5,I m never disappointed with this apps. Always shows the best deals available
2015,5,Found a flight from Chicago to Panama for $100! Cant beat that price. This app is amazing
2015,5,Pretty useful app. It offers you an easier travelling. Loving it!
2015,5,"Best app so far in its category. Cheapest price, easy to use. I love this app..."
2015,4,A great and convenient app. Its my goto app when checking on available international flights before going to specific airline web site.
2015,1,App has been changed. Harder to use. Won't use again.
2015,1,The first time i say this for any app... The new app is all buggy and non responsive.
2015,5,I can not believe how cheap tickets are!!! I'm going back home to Ukraine in may and I'm ecstatic about prices!!! I will save over 400$!!! Best app ever!!!
2015,1,I was forced to download this app in order to use the free WiFi of the airport. Nice way to pump up your download rates.
2015,3,Why do my friends that have this app in different countries get cheaper flights when in England all the flights are over ¬£100 + more expensive ????
2015,1,Went through the whole process and at the end the price bumps up 300 bucks.  What a waste of time.
2015,5,Very useful. Thank you so much
2015,3,I need a multi-city flight and that's not possible with this app... Otherwise 5 stars!
2015,1,This was a good app but it doesn't work anymore when searching for full months.
2015,5,Sempre uso esse aplicativo depois vou no site da empresa direto. Deveria haver a possibilidade dele avisar no pr√≥prio celular a respeito das ofertas que procuramos.
2015,5,I can easily find the best flights availabile here. I no longer need to book via agency to get the most flexible flights.
2015,4,"Raising from 2 to 4 stars after last update, still their is room to improve keep it up"
2015,5,"I always check skyscanner to compare the prices, sometimes even get cheaper price than airline directly. Love it...."
2015,3,"Do check the legitimacy of the websites which offer the lowest rates, as the reviews of those websites are worst !!"
2015,5,If you're looking for cheap flights this app is a necessity. It scans for cheap flights and does all the work.
2015,5,Simple... perfect... useful.... there is no more to say!
2015,1,New 'upgrade' strips out convenient features rendering it useless to me.
2015,5,Always find prices better than Orbitz. Love the price alerts too that you can set.
2015,4,It woukd  perfect I could consult several destinations at the same time.
2015,3,Only issue is it cannot check the prices for long term search
2015,5,It works perfect. It give vest rates.
2015,5,The most awesome thing is it's free. Love it‚ù§Ô∏è
2015,5,I can now easily find flights and places to go. Destination Anywhere is icing on the cake.
2015,4,Give me good information about the price and time to all flights
2015,5,Very easy to use and most importantly it's pretty easy to see the big picture in terms of flights availability across several days.
2015,5,"I just need a multy trips option otherwise , it's easy to use, fast, and accurate ."

2015,1,"This is the first time I have ever rated an app but the new updates to skyscanner have made me so upset that I felt compelled to do so. I used to be a massive fan and used the skyscanner app all the time. I've just had the latest update and it is dreadful. The interface is not at all user friendly and I can't figure out what is going on. It makes me want to cry, I loved the old app and used it constantly. Now I can't use skyscanner anymore because this new update makes it impossible to understand."
2015,2,"I like the skyscanner, helped me a lot. However, they do associate with airline agency companies who rip people off. I had to learn the hard way with Bookairfare. They canceled my flight and didn't give me my money or flight. Everytime I called Bookairfare, they would disconnect and claim it as phone disconnection. Anyway when using this, research the airline agency you booking with before giving your money. Skyscanner sometimes associates with bad airline agencies."
2015,1,"With the release of the ""new"" app I've changed my review from 5 stars to 1. It's not presenting any new information, but the new layout is confusing and annoying, and where is my ""whole month"" setting with the easy to view chart gone?. Also, have you guys tried using this version on a cellphone in landscape mode, it now shows bugger all unless I rotate back to portrait. Give me the old one back, this one is crap."
2015,1,"You say you've been listening, but not sure who to, possibly the developers who made such a mess of this. Please, please, please give us the option to download old version, that is intuitive, easy to use and actually works before everyone follows and starts using other apps. Keep the new version for people that like something pretty that's next to useless, but let us get hold of the old version as well, it was the best travel app out there."
2015,1,Interface for older one is better than this. The update made it difficult to search and less friendly. Hopefully you will make it more user-friendly and do not look so complex. Please put back the exact price in the graph. The way you made it make me confused. 8[
2015,1,"It's not that it's now dreadful or unusable. It's just that the previous version was absolutely perfect. Why would you even think such a radical overhaul of an app with so many 5 star reviews was ever needed? You should just change it back to the better looking and easier to use version, and get rid of whoever signed off this embarrassing episode. I look forward to receiving the same copy-paste response from Skyscanner as all the other negative reviews. You know. The one with the link that you can't click."
2015,1,"APP UPDATED: Sky Scanner app update doesn't allow the feature that set it apart from the rest, the ability to search flights without indicating a departure/return dates. I use to recommend this app due to this AWESOME tool, but not anymore. It's okay, plenty other flight apps out there."
2015,1,"So I never bother to review apps and this review is not so much about the app, which works fine, but the fact that skyscanner seems to be so uselessly stupid that it can only find flights that are at least twice as expensive as any other sources. And no, it's not that I'm only seeing one way instead of return, it is that skyscanner is a piece of manure. Don't waste your time, go somewhere else"
2015,1,"The new design & layout on the latest version is incredibly hard to use & very unintuitive, making for a poor user experience. The strength of Skyscanner used to be its simplicity. And where is the option to search flights across an entire month without specifying an exact date?!"
2015,2,This is my prefered app since a long time but the old interface was much easier and showing same info.  Also filtering on direct flights is no more available at first screen but should wait long time till all flights are loaded then to filter unlike the older version.     Hope to support multi destination flight
2015,1,"As a user who uses this app a lot, i was first surprised because the new design looked nicer. Bur after 1 week of use i am shocked by how complicated and not intuitive it is. Its a clear step behind. Please bring the old version immediately!"
2015,1,"DONT UPGRADE!! The new skyscanner app is rubbish. It doesn't tell you price variations on monthly view. You can't open multiple pages to check different legs of journey. It is a completely different app from the older , more simple but more complex app. I just wish i never updated to the new version. And i cant find the old one. Such a shame. From best app to worst in a 30 second upgrade. Shame on you program develpers. üòùüòùüòù"
2015,3,"The new update made things look pretty good. I like the new layout, the new front-page which records recent searches. The comparison table though, has become worse. It certainly looks nice, but is much harder to find, and does not display the prices, and doesn't have a scale to let me know what the price difference is."
2015,3,"I liked the old version more for reasons others already mentioned and am waiting for a better update. Features like search without date, parallel searching are gone. App is redundant. Prices first indicated sometimes are not shown after ""second"" search."
2015,2,"**The recent update has destroyed a trusted source. Prices change when you select BOOK, sometimes doubling in price. Choice of airlines greatly reduced. No option to delete multiple airlines. Devastated as this was my sole one stop for flights..."
2015,1,What happened to this perfectly running and intuitive app? I tried to get this new version under control before I posted my rating here. It's just confusing and everything else than intuitive. Everything takes so much more clicks than before and it is just not possible to get the benefits I loved so much in the old version. Please... Where can I download the old version?
2015,1,"I have always used Skyscanner to plan my travels but the new release simply doesn't deliver. The filter on direct flights doesn't work anymore, it's no longer possible to search without dates and the country view is not as sleek. Can we go back to the old version?"
2015,3,"With the update you can no longer search for direct flights only, which means you get a long list of flights taking 35 hours for a 4 hour journey. Also the interface is not so user friendly. Another case of an upgrade not improving anything."
2015,1,"Don't install it. You will be disappointed. Not convenient, unclear application: unclear information about nouber of changes force to read text (no circle icons),small airline logos, small fonts,  absence of combined lines filter, absence of possibility to manage recent search, no possibility to sort recent search, a lot of free unused space on screen but small fonts, ridiculous flight ratings, taking lines. The best example of that, how to change clear and convenient app into unclear and unconvenient one."
2015,2,"This app used to be amazing, but now, for some reason, it's completely inoperable. Searching anytime/anywhere flights leaves me with a total of 7 odd countries to choose from, and even then it grants 0 flight data for anything. That's the biggest issue: NO FLIGHT DATA WHATSOEVER....FOR ANYTHING! Giving it 2 stars only because I know how cool the app used to be. Hopefully the day will come when I can open this app again and actually be able to use it."
2015,1,Go back to the old version. The functionality of it doesn't work. This new version is not user friendly. Why change something that was so awesome before. Most people are saying the same thing why change it if it isn't broke. I probably find another app to use now. üò¢
2015,1,"What happened to being able to simply select where you wanted to go and scroll thought dates and prices, took me ages to find the price bar charts, then you select the dates, press done, and nothing happens, then you spend ages figuring out you need to search. Why would you select dates and do nothing? And the results are so unclear! The old app was great, if it ain't broke...."
2015,1,"Downloaded it, the signed up for new account. Verified email, the online site nor the app will acknowledge my login. Unable to verify if the app works as I can't get past the login screen."
2015,1,Awful. I adore skyscanner and the old interface was perfect for really squeezing the details and getting the best deal. This new interface is disastrous and clumpy and actually limits your overall vision. Not good. Gutted. :( Please reverse!
2015,1,"Bring back the old design. It was easy to use, allowed you to search flights costs over the month easily and quickly and was much, much easier to navigate. Won't be using the app until it's been developed. Love the site but will be using the desktop instead."
2015,2,"Really very disappointed :( the old version is faraway better than this rabish , all good in this new one is only design and graphics but for use the old one was very easy and simple I hope that you get back the old version + the new design. Sorry i would like to give 5 stars but not for this virsion .thx"
2015,1,"Used to be my go to app for all my travel needs. Not anymore,  the update has rendered it all but useless. Too much going on, time to look for a new search application."
2015,1,"Used to be the best search engine for flight prices, but the new update is dreadful. Previous version was perfect and simple, but the update is overly complex, the UI is cluttered and the extra features are unnecessary and clumsy. Massive shame but will be uninstalling."
2015,4,Thank you for your reply. At first I couldn't see the month view with the bar chart. It is easily missed. It's true the new interface seems less intuitive but at least that's there.
2015,1,"This app was absolutly  amazing but now with those new updates,ruinned all application. It's not that easy to use. I would rather go on proper websites to look for flights as this application is only waste of my time."
2015,1,An update from the end of October messed up the whole app for me. I updated a new version today and it still not working.  All my flight searches always come up with ZERO results.  Galaxy S5.
2015,2,This app was the best used it all the time! Now with the upgrade i think im going to delete it and find a different one its unusable and no point in it as can't look through the grid and find the cheapest day or anything which is why i loved it. Should have left it how it was!
2015,2,"was great! but now... still crashes when I select ""everywhere"" as destination or try and select dates for other destinations. please advise and let me know if u need logs. submitted request on request page."
2015,5,"I just needed to explore the app more. I was initially disappointed but the developer pointed out how to get the ""old"" view I want. I'm quite happy now. Thanks!"
2015,4,"A very fast and user friendly interface, really like it. But on android, the app appears as 'Flights' not Skyscanner so it's not always placed where you expect it in the app drawer."
2015,1,It is so confusing now to select flights and dates! Why have you tried to fix something that was never broken in the first place..? Please can you restore the old version!! What were you thinking..? Terrible!!
2015,1,"Please go back to older version, new version sucks, you cant find any flight,  there is no month calender. I remove this app until it gets back to normal."
2015,1,"I used to love and recommend this app to anyone who would listen but they have gotten rid of the most useful function. A bar chart saying the dates across an extended period of time was much more useful than green, yellow and red dots which you have to memorize the amounts they relate to because as you scroll down through the months the drop down ""colour coded price key"" doesn't follow.can't explain seriously enough....if it isn't broken, don't fix it!!!!"
2015,5,"Haven't used it for quite some times. Great functionality like the original version with more great features, faster, & friendlier interfaces. Keep it up!"
2015,1,The old version was better. You dont have a statistic of flight price per days. Put the option +/- 3 days in search
2015,4,Prices are great! The only problem I got was at check out. When it was time to pay keeps saying it's an error but I call the number they provide and got it done! Otherwise I would have given a 5 stars
2015,1,I can still get my work done but requires some getting used to. Not a fan of change for change's sake though. CORRECTIONS: compared it with the old app and I can get better results much more easily previously
2015,4,I like the app but i do not like the monthly graph the colours are to light and its hard to read. The old monthly graph was better. And the graph had airline selection filter.
2015,1,"What used to be so easy and clear to use is now a garbled mess. So much empty space in initial start screen, no sign of reverse direction switch. Text too small. Old app was so much better"
2015,5,Cheapest way to fly. I have been using their website for a couple years before they came out with this app. So happy they did!!!! Thanks for everything guys
2015,5,Like to browse whole months by price which you could before update.. seems more of a hassle to find what you are looking for...which is mainly cheap flights :(
2015,2,The app is called 'Flights'. Took me ages to find it and pulled my hair out in the process. I have over 300 apps. Why not call it Skyscanner?
2015,1,Not working on my sony z ultra. Error- skyscanner has stopped. Please and please give us the old version back.
2015,5,"Helps me find super cheap fair,  does not save cookies like webapges do to jack up the price each time you search. Going to London from cental USA for $731  in two more weeks. Easy to use, love it."
2015,1,Want the old version back... reset my tablet and redownloaded the app to find its now rubbish.... where can i find the old version.
2015,1,Very bad since update. All my friends have stopped using it now. You need to bring back the old way NOW.
2015,5,Some users don't know English well and want to use the app try to add arabic please and more airlines. Thank you.
2015,1,"Colour change makes information difficult to read, horrid please change back to old version... This is a bad user experience..."
2015,5,Good app to know reference rates. No annoying ads. There is still many ways to goal. For example searching indirect flights for low cost airways.  Keep going guys.
2015,5,"Good app to find cheap flight in months. He has also have price alert, if the price is changes you got email. Must have app :)"
2015,1,I loved this app. Now you have ruined the UI.  The best thing was being able to view a whole month easily ..
2015,5,"Find cheapest flights for the destination you want. What would make it better would be to see all cheapest flights from an airport - wait, you can do that lol. Great app"
2015,1,New updates have ruined this app. I have used this for all my previous flights but now I will find a new app üëé
2015,5,Still using this app on multiple occasions since 2013. I find it accurate and reliable without any hassles or fuss. ... Well done You
2015,1,The previous version was so much better! It was so easy to use. Please bring back the old one.
2015,1,Why ruin a brilliant app with this dreadful new interface. I have booked many flights through skyscanner but unless I can find a way to get back to the old interface I won't be booking anymore.
2015,5,"It is quite handy! Next thing probably is to be able to make your own flight, mixing from 2 combinations and having a quotation. :-)"
2015,2,"Please make color dot to indicate price ranges distinguishable, colorblind and very confusing when can't tell apart colors (red green orange) make yellow red blue..."
2015,4,Very easy to get the hang of and good cheap results. One app that uses a large variety of search engines to provide the best possible prices
2015,5,Has a very user friendly interface. Great airfares with the touch of a button!
2015,4,Great app and positive update!  Waiting for multi city search to give 5 stars!
2015,4,"Nice new graphic, but multi-city flights search is very much needed, four stars only until then."
2015,4,Love the graphs and the widget... Helps me to find the cheapest flights available.
2017,4,Great app for checking prices of flights- saves a lot of time online!
2016,1,I can buy the flight direct from the airline for $134 or I can pay $178 through your partner on this app. No brainer.
2015,1,"This used to be the best app for travel and then they ""fixed"" it. Totally unusable now. Awful. Awful. Awful."
2015,2,"Every time to search other place the app has to close and restart. Back button is not working in app, solve it immediately"
2015,5,great flight search app. just needs to look at giving options on nearby airports!
2015,5,"The layout is beautiful, the search works great, and it puts a new twist on how you look to travel."
2015,5,The best app to get the best rates and also to get live rates. Using it for a really long time. I do recommend this app.
2015,5,"Hi, I just downloaded it and notice that you reply comments and that is awesome. Thanks."
2015,3,Flights info from China is a bit of messy. Do not use this app if you're searching flights departing from China.
2015,2,Please go back to the previous  version or at least give us an option  to chose  from.
2015,1,"Poor and very disappointing  update - destroying its prior excellent ""go- to"" flight app reputation!"
2015,1,"I loved the old version as it was so easy to use to check and buy  flights, it was so different from other sites hence why I used it, please bring back the old version"
2015,2,I prefer last version because there have multi-windows for searching.it's easier to find that i need to know
2015,1,Plz check fare price somewhere else before buying ticket from this app because you may paying 1000-1500 more for same seat.
2015,3,"Every time I search for a flight, the app tells me the flight unfortunately stopped.. Fix it, please!"
2015,1,"This app used to be great, but now it's difficult to use and doesn't show the correct prices."
2015,5,Perfect! Best app ever! Fast! Full of options and more!
2015,4,Appearance becomes better but lost function like multi-city booking. Bring them back!
2015,1,"The old was was the perfect layout, the price graph was exactly how it should have been, too bad, used this a lot to buy international tickets."
2015,5,It's amazing. ..no headache. .always secure. .prooven cheapest always
2015,1,new app terrible difficult to read and no way user friendly old app was very good and easy to use.
2015,1,"New interface is horrible and ugly, whoever told you the old design needed changing is on drugs."
2015,4,we were able to see a number of flights at various times and cost. Great way to see all the airlines in real time.
2015,4,"So far so good, will give 5 stars after travel. ‚ò∫"
2015,1,This update is not an improvement. What was wrong with the old one?
2015,5,This app is just what I needed to get the best deals. Thanks
2015,1,Why can't I select all month for a trip and see the price of each day inside that month as before?
2015,1,Don't like the new version. Very hard to navigate.
2015,4,Back to normality. Lesson to be learned if it ain't broke don't fix it
2015,4,Everything I was looking for! 4* for some minor things I would like to be different
2015,5,Such a simple and cost effective way of searching for flights. Couldn't recommend more.
2015,1,"Get it back to the way it was please,  when it was easy to navigate, easy to read,  clear and concise."
2015,2,I really hate the new version old one was the best I must say
2015,3,Very bad version this was manly the best app until you rewind it
2015,5,"This app is simple, easy and straight to the point when it come to travel. It don't get no better than this."
2015,2,You've tried to be too clever with this update - didn't work
2015,4,If you could do multi city searches like you can on the website then I'd give it a 5
2015,5,"Use it for flights home, holidays, spur of the moment trips. Easy to use and gives you the right price."
2015,4,Will give 5 stars when I can add AAA and Premier membership info.
2015,4,It's so helpful and flexible to get a ticket to any airport üëç
2015,4,"Very handy and excellent, however multiple cities option is not available."
2015,1,Especially can't see comparing day by day. It's disappeared.
2015,5,This is one of the best flight search app I ever used. Easy search and great results.
2015,5,"It has everything I might need from a flights app that can compare prices and gets the best deals,  complete and flexible."
2015,5,Great access to thousand of flights. It makes to book my holidays easier
2015,5,Marbles guys it's really nice App keep it up .I recommend download guys. ..üòä
2015,1,Was a 5 star app now rubbish after last update.
2015,5,"This app is very essential, very helpful and very precise with airline prices. Helps me buy cheap flights all the time."
2015,5,Great app for air travel.Quike and easy to use. Always recommend it to family and friends
2015,5,My main app to find the cheapest and best flights. A must
2015,4,I prefered it before the latest update but it's still awesome
2015,4,Just found a great deal for tickets for China and Bangladesh.
2015,4,On the calendar I can't tell if it's  a red or green dot.
2015,4,Had some cheap flights so am happy
2015,5,"It'd that simple, connecting you directly to airlines not Atlantic based travel agents!!!!"
2015,4,Good app for finding the flights around the world.
2015,5,Got comparisons from all airlines and the bar chart showing the cheapest periods. Its perfect for budget travellers!
2015,4,Provides some good info for flexible travel!
2015,4,I miss having the calendar more at hand to change dates.
2015,5,New version of Skyscanner is even better than the old one: search results list is clearer and it looks better
2015,5,More useful than any airline's site.

2015,2,"I have been using this app for long time. A very helpful app but the the latest update is bad. Two issues:  1. Even I select the direct flight option in the start date and return date, the search result still displays all results. I need to click the filter again in order to display the direct flight only.  2. The second one is more annoying issue. In the older version, I was able to see all prices around my planned dates by clicking the Chart symbol. In the latest version, I only see the price of particular date I have selected in the Chart. In order to locate if there is any cheaper tickets around my planned date, I have to click each date around my date manually to see the pop up price. I would prefer to view prices around my planned date without clicking each date. Is there any way I can install the previous version of this app.   3. The Chart symbol only exists in the start and return date screen instead of existing on the result screen. I would prefer to see the Chart symbol exists in both screens which is a more efficient way to locate cheaper tickets.4. On Skyscanner website, why there is no Chart function which allows users to view prices around planned date?"
2015,1,"The update put too many menu clicks in the way of the prices. When I look for flights I like to quickly change parameters and sliders. You've made it more convoluted. The colour coding system is pointless as you won't be changing flight dates to weeks into the future. You could safely assume that people know prices of flights will rocket within a month of departure date. Enable us to search by price. A nice feature one of your rivals has is to search by budget, 'where will ¬£200 get me?'. Please try again."
2015,4,"It's always nice to keep an app updated with the latest design trends but please keep all the functionality: 1) ability to swap departure/arrival airports was so handy in case of multi leg journeys. 2) the month view needs to be easier to retrieve, had to read all the reviews here to get it. 3) the results screen is so pale that everything looks similar! There should be clear separation between options and ability to choose different outbound and inbound flights while combining results."
2015,1,"Do you think serious that you make a app better if you put some flags a and pictures on the app? The view is to coulurful, poor and slow service, no price indication on weeks chart.... I think I'm talking for everyone here that's a better idea if you undo the app to the old version ...  I'll definitely no longer use so long as it is so shifty.. Thank you for the update Skyscanner not"
2015,1,Is this app supposed to look like the pictures? Because the one I've just installed looks nothing like it. That was the simpler version that thankfully I still have on my iPhone.  Seems I miss the option to quickly reverse the to and from destinations to search for one way flights quickly if it's easier to do that. And it doesn't look as clean and simple as before
2015,1,"Why provide an upgrade that removed all the great features of the old app.  I can not figure out how to have multiple pages open to search different options for different routes,  can not work out how to get the list of all flight options on day of choice across all airlines from cheapest to most expensive on preferred day, and most importantly I  it was great in the old version on how to the price for each day on a sliding day calendar.  The photos still show these old options but seem to be gone. Very sad"
2015,1,"Skyscanner was my favourite app to search for cheap flights. I especially loved the monthly charts to look for the cheapest day, but now it is quite useless. First I started in landscape mode , as the previous version allowed to see a full month for departure day and return day. The new version only displays a few days at the same time and I was totally stuck selecting the departure and return date. Finally I gave up, switched to portrait mode. Then the second bar chart showed up. But worse than before ..."
2015,1,"Please back to old version. Or let users choose to use old version or new one. Skyscanner use to be fast, easy and nice. I am a brazilian backpacker I had travel every continent almost 50 countries always using this app. I love skyscanner. But now not so cool to use. Please let us keep using old version."
2015,1,"Dear Skyscanner management, are you sure your ""app team"" wasn't paid by your competitors to come up with an ""update"" that completely ruins the user-experience and drives away the majority of your users? I mean, just look at the number of pissed-off reviewers. Please do your longtime users, a favour by reverting back to the old and working app."
2015,4,"New application looks much nicer than before and seems to perform a lot better too. Unfortunately it's become more difficult to navigate.  Also, I would mention in the 'What's New' change log why identity permissions are now needed. (I assume it's for social login)  This is still the best flight aggregator service out there. Thanks, guys!"
2015,4,"Love the ap, but have been caught out, brought a return flight but it had baggage to my destination but none to come back with and cost us alot extra. We didn't realise until after we had brought the deal and we could not upgrade baggage because agent said contact airline -airline said call agent... so hoping update in ap shows if baggage is included in price.. and is easy to find out.. Thanks"
2015,1,Flights are never available at the price displayed and the websites that you get directed to are very hard to deal with. One only had a $2 per minute phone line to try and get a flight changed. Only use this app to find what routes are available then deal directly with the airline for peace of mind.
2015,1,"Very hard to navigate. Also price quoted often drastically changes once you click on the link to book. Poor option to flex flights and dates. Also if pick one date to fly, how then can that price go up or down by 300% depending on the flight back which were both listed as a similar price."
2015,5,"Most flight searching apps are a down-graded version of the website that it is based on,¬† with important features like +/- days and flexible searches left out. This app, on the other hand, may be even better and more flexible than the site itself. I've always loved Skyscanner, not just for its inclusion of budget Airlines,¬† but for its innovative design and the flexibility to search openly (without inputting a destination for example). Needless to say,¬† I was excited to find this app!"
2015,2,"Every time I get search results, when I click on any option, it gives me the error [Unfortunately,Flights has stopped]. I logged in with my account, logged out, re installed, re started my device still the same. Please fix this. I use to love the skyscanner app and now its not working."
2015,4,"Hey, I like the new look, and im sure I'll get used to the new functionality of the app. Can you let me know if you intend to bring multi-city flights back? This was one of the most useful standout features of the previous version. I don't have much use for the app without it."
2015,1,"What have you done with my favorite app? Interface is horrible, everything's messed up. Perhaps I just need some time to figure that out but for now my rating is only one start. Best regards."
2015,1,"Please, how do I find the old version?!  A. From start to flight, many more clicks than before.  B. Colour coded price indicator extremely inaccurate!  C.  Harder to figure out where the cheaper flights are.  With the old bar graph system I could see clearly which flights were higher and lower and select accordingly.  D. Much slower.  I don't need pics just quick info.  Change isn't always a good thing.  You guys had it perfect before.  Clearly too many idle hands!!!!  Please please please, change it back?"
2015,1,"I've just reinstalled Skyscanner, as I'd removed it to free up some memory. What has happened to it?  Absolutely dreadful. It's not user friendly at all. The old layout was so easy and intuitive. This one? Time to uninstall again! üò° I guess my go-to app/site will be Google Flights now..."
2015,4,This provides me with immidiate solutions and unable me to book immidiatly. The combinations are great and this provides you with actual options. Payment from Middle East countries might take time and uncomfortable calls and confirmations which I find unpleasant. Maybe there is a easier way to buy a ticket. Further the first choice for me.
2015,5,"I been booking fifteen to twenty flights per year on this website for the last few years & it's totally amazing!  There is no way I could travel without Skyscanner now!!!  P S. I do prefer the old version of the app though, the latest update is taking a bit of time to get used to."
2015,2,I feel like it's harder to track a flight with the recent update. Too much going on and crowded. New layout will say flights available for  $35 but when you check the calendar you see flights not lower than  $100....wth?!?!?
2015,1,"I found tickets saying 798.00 round trip. I go to book and sends me to virgin Atlantic and was 1600.00 dollars. That was huge difference in price. I write them and there answer was ok sorry, we will change it. Nothing about trying to get me any help finding tickets. Horrible!!! Im here looking for tickets, why wouldn't you help me?"
2015,4,"The old browser was very easy to use. The new interface is beautiful, but it is harder to use... if possible, please make the fonts bolder and larger.. however, this is still a good app to search for flight tickets..."
2015,1,"What ever possessed you to ruin a brilliant app. Pale blue colours, hardly  readable text, complexly confusing airport and date selection. Etc etc. Absolutely awful, had to revert to using laptop version."
2015,2,"There is too much going on in the screen. The last version was better as you could search for the whole month and it showed clearer results. The colour coding on the calendar only gives you a price range not an exact price. For me, I prefer the older version."
2015,1,"I actually like the new design of the app. It's a shame that it doesn't work though. I search for flights and when I try and tap on a month, the application just crashes. I've sent in a bug report but this is quite a glaring problem with the app I have no choice but to 1 star."
2015,4,"It's short way from ""must have"" app to useless app. Update: restart of my phone solved the issue. Now I see all flights with details. Only 4 stars because of this issue."
2015,1,"The new version is pretty bad. I can't search a full month anymore, nor do multiple searches/tabs at once. Those were the best features..."
2015,3,"I am very happy with the search capabilities as they led me to an opportunity I would have otherwise missed.  I am upset though because your app description indicates no fees.  Since your app bounced me to Bravofly, I ended up paying approximately $30 in fees that I wouldn't have had if I had booked directly."
2015,2,This is a disaster. For years used Skyscanner and now can't seem to make head or tail of it. Old version was simple with clicking onto what day you wanted and see price comparisons of near by days. Why have you made it unappealing?
2015,1,New update unfortunately sucks... People who use it frequency you can see that they all complain. This huge brain ceo who had that idea is genius.... Keep going...
2015,4,"Material Design works good. But please make the ""search"" button as fab and strech the passenger information to full width. Would work perfect on this UI!"
2015,1,"Since the upgrade,  the app doesn't work on my Sony Z Ultra at all. Disappointed as I used to use this app for all my flight bookings. Have had to install Kayak"
2015,2,What happened to multiple windows? Also the new graph for viewing price fluctuations is horrible. Please put it back into calendar view vs the current linear view.
2015,1,"This new version of Skyscanner is absolutely awful. It used to be really easy to tweak your search criteria to get to the best deal, now it's really hard work - will not be using it anymore."
2015,5,"The new app is absolutely amazing in material design. It works so well, gives me all the features I could ever want, it's stable and what's more, it's beautiful. This app has to be editor's choice very very soon."
2015,3,I take back what I said . The new update is OK . Just the layout is different.  But I do prefer the way it was . High lighting the expensive months is good . All flights have gone through the roof in the West side of Oz.
2015,2,"So much harder to use since the update, it might look better, but it's much harder to use. I guess it might save me some money no longer making so many impulse flight purchases, now it's much harder to find them."
2015,1,You've ruined your own app. Either revert back to the previous incarnation or watch your entire user base disappear. Truly terrible.
2015,1,This used to be my go to app for travel.. Told everyone about it. But the new design is horrible and I will need to rethink what app i use. Not sure what focus group was used by the company that suggested this  revision.
2015,1,"This used to be a good useful app and worked brilliantly, now it's basically un usable absolutely terrible update.  Which numpty designed and signed this rubbish off"
2015,5,I really love the new design. It's more helpful please don't change it back to the previous one. Thanks alot for such a lovely app :)
2015,2,It is so hard to use after the update. No more scrolling by which dates are cheapeat even when I have selected the 'anytime' selection. I love the old version.
2015,1,"The last app was brilliant, this new version is terrible. I won't ever use it again. Have you been taken over??"
2015,5,"Have been using from past few weeks. The app is much better than the web version, mainly because of the push notifications. Neat and friendly UI."
2015,1,"I just can't be bothered using it anymore, this latest update really screws everything up, I'm looking for another app now, one that is user friendly."
2015,4,"I love your new ui & ux guys. But why you separated fligt & hotel service :( . too much for me, i have to download many apps on the phone."
2015,1,You had a good one such a shame. Now looking for another. Jan Cooper. Found Cheap flights app easier to use & cheaper. (-:
2015,2,Don't like the layout..should have kept it as it was.... can't look at individual days and prices anymore... harder to use!!
2015,3,"Don't get me wrong, this app is still one of the best flight search apps, but what happened to the bar chart of prices, or the ability to change travel agent? Other than that, I've booked just about every flight I've taken for years with the help of Skyscanner, and its been a massive help."
2015,5,Great app! Love this new function.. We can check now on which date the flight will be cheaper ;) thanks
2015,1,Crashes every time on selecting date or month.The previous version was rock solid but this update or new version keeps crashing so please fix it.
2015,2,How you can destroy a fantastic useful app with a totally idiotic new version is hard to believe. Mainly guilty are those who approved this!
2015,1,The latest version is trash.  How can I get my multiple search Windows back?  The older version was superior and easier to navigate...
2015,5,"I like the new UI, especially the widget which I look at every day now has a scroll function. I always use Skyscanner to search for my flights, brilliant app"
2015,5,"Love the new update, it's much easier to find a cheap flight and the app looks amazing. Great work, really."
2015,1,Previous version so much simpler and easy to use. Old saying if it ain't broke don't fix it comes to mind!!!
2015,1,Confusing and pointless update. I will be uninstalling if this isn't rectified. What the hell was wrong with the old version?!
2015,1,"Have deleted now after update, was the best flight site now confusing and useless!! Totally not using anymore"
2015,1,"This version is awful. So hard to navigate, while trying way too hard to be stylish. The old version was absolutely perfect."
2015,5,"This app is the best for this task and has the best usability for a mobile app. In fact, the showed prices does not have the best prices, but the differences are little and the agility offered by this app compensates it."
2015,1,It's so harder to use after the recent update. ... also giving the option of multiple city flights will be better
2015,5,But i prefered the old version a bit more because it was easier to navigate through the app... Please include advanced search options like multiple destinations
2015,5,If ever there was a program to offer the quickest views for finding flights with the most dynamic filters then this is the program for you!  Give it shot and see what you have  to gain! :)  Enjoy!
2015,5,"The update has made this app more informative than before, whatever you want you get in this app. A must for every traveller."
2015,1,The new version of sky scanner is awful. It's not convenient for use at all. You made it complicated and uncomfortable.
2015,3,Does what its intended to do but why remove the Cebu Pacific pricing? Would have been better if you could see all the carriers you wanted in one app
2015,1,Destroys the ease of use that the first one had.  Harder to search whole month and user interface is ugly minimalistic
2015,1,Any chance you can add a classic view button so every one can switch back to the better version off this app thanks
2015,2,"Why is it when an update is applied you end up with a poor quality looking app, why not just make the update and leave the rest as it is if you can't enhance the look of it, don't try and fix something that isn't broken!"
2015,1,Should be 0 star. Awful layout colours and fonts.  Sack the designer. Won't use any more.
2015,5,Realised ive been tipped off for flights in the past. This app gives you all possible flight to and from ur destination and best prices. Highly recommend
2015,4,I liked how easy and fast I could search for cheap flights. You guys need to change it back to the old version
2015,1,"I've been using the app for years, until the last update where you've mixed up the basic whole month overview as well as the airports view from the whole country."
2015,5,No issues with the latest update and actually like the new layout. Use it frequently to find the best fares.
2015,5,Where is the charts. It was the best feature in the app. Could you please put it back.
2015,1,This used to be such a good app. Since the update. Its crap. Uninstalled it.
2015,2,Very  hard and useless after update skyscanner is nice application before but new version is very critical please fix it
2015,5,Great search features like 'go anywhere from where you are'. Simple to use but powerful.
2015,1,It wasn't broke so why try fix it? Latest update is brutal and will be deleted imminently!
2015,1,So many useless UI elements. Nothing of use. Will uninstall
2015,2,New update made a great app so confusing functionally! Aesthetics is secondary!
2015,2,"Awful since update.Every time i pick direct flights it comes up as 2 stops, nearly made a big mistake that could of cost me!"
2015,1,"I have used skyscanner for 10 years but now it has changed I think I'll go back to searching websites myself, terrible app"
2015,1,Why oh why change what works? what else can I find? Truly awful experience/ app
2015,5,"Weather you're a frequent flyer or just fly once a year this app is a must have, you'll save so much money and time searching for affordable flights."
2015,4,"I tried several sites for fare tracking, but this app was able to generate many combinations of flights to find the cheapest roundtrip fares."
2015,2,The new update is awful. Trying to compare different destinations and dates is too awkward and clumsy.
2015,2,I have to say this update is a disappointment. I loved the previous one because how easy it was.
2015,1,Latest version causes too much crashes. It always needs a force stop.
2015,1,Was a great app until the update. Why mess with a good thing?
2015,1,"Sadly doesn't work on a Sony running 5.1.1. Now forced to use Momondo, which does work"
2015,5,It's a great useful app. The prices shown on both the website and the app are the same unlike before. Air tickets for great prices!
2015,2,Update is far more difficult to navigate around. Not user friendly
2015,1,"May look pretty, but useless compared to old. Why fix something that ain't broke."
2015,5,"Quick, efficient, redlly handy. Do you want the cheapest flight on THAT date? You can do it. It's so cool."
2015,5,Good and useful app. New version's font too small.  üò¢
2015,4,Its a awesome app for flights it will be more better if us can even book hotels and cab from here only
2015,3,The block type monthly price graphic was so much easier to read. The new rounded edges are misleading.
2015,2,Don't like the new app! Not as user friendly
2015,2,"Old app excellent, new one pathetically poorly designed. Please put it back the way it was."
2015,1,"Used to be very user friendly now so complicated, takes time to read and understand, used to just glance at it and knew what was what."
2015,1,Bring back the old UI. The latest version is not good.
2015,1,"There was nothing wrong with the old one.why change...,if its not broke don't fix it"
2015,2,"New one is unusable, though last release fixed some bugs, still I'd prefer to use old UI."
2015,5,"Absolutely ******* fantastic. Love it. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I ******* would!"
2015,4,Looking for flights is hard.  This gave me a wider choice selection and more airports to choose from
2016,4,All possible destinations under one roof.. Great App for booking domestic and international air tickets
2015,3,I cannot find my booking. It is terrible there is no such function.
2015,1,It went from a simple app to super complicated and hard to use I don't  think I will be using this anymore
2015,4,Good & more information. What we are expected get full with complete details.
2015,5,Fab - didnt work that well for me pre upgrade on mobile - but now great for point to point flights. Head to head with Google flights.
2015,4,Love the fact that you can see the cheapest flights rather than destination!
2015,1,In my note4 I can't book my ticket just shows price plz fix it
2015,1,New version crashes all the time and is not easy to use.
2015,1,Force closes on date selection (have reported the force close).
2015,5,Simply awesome app. Thanks guys
2015,1,pleasee where can i downliad the old version ... ??? the new one is one big psycho :D
2015,5,Best App to find and book the cheapest flights.... Travel Around the world ... Freedom from Travel Agents...
2015,1,"After I selected traveling dates and clicked Done, instead of showing the flights, it returns to previous page...."
2015,1,Looks awful. Feels awful. Is awful. Unusable. Please roll back.
2015,2,"I like the multi windows search and the prices shown in a full month feature, they are gone now."
2015,1,The Skyscanner is the best search for flights but the new application it's awful
2015,1,It kept telling me that there is no flight available even though i have already chance the date..
2015,5,"Always use this. But to book, I have better luck going directly to carrier website."
2015,5,This prices are great! Can't wait to book my next trip
2015,5,Love the app. My first choice when need to buy flight tickets.
2015,1,Brilliant app however new upgrade is terrible and ruined it.
2015,5,Love the app but not really trust the agents based on some bad reviews.
2015,2,This app does not show Cebu Pacific flights. I have to use other app just to compare all the flights
2015,5,Superb for those who luvs traveling.  Never stop using it since install.
2015,4,I have reviewed the information and the price reflect the true market price.
2015,1,Nightmare of an update. Will be changing to Kayak
2015,1,Update destroyed it. Switching to google
2015,4,Can't see prices by date to see which date has the lowest price.
2015,1,Is this an option? The new version's terrible
2015,1,So much harder to use since the update.
2015,5,I use Skyscanner first for all my flights. Nothing better.
2015,4,Good but it could be more user friendly.
2015,1,Best app for future travel n best to analyse the trip
2015,5,"To put filters when searching for ""everywhere"" so the price that comes out are the relevant price."
2015,5,Just need away to use air miles collected from past flights???       And also allow you to plan multiple flights???
2015,5,Easy to use app. All the information I need in one place.
2015,5,Great app all you need for the best price on flights..
2015,5,"Excellent app for finding deals as it is always live,  unlike some others üòä"
2015,5,I am finding the new version to be very useful...I m still new
2015,1,Just crashes whenever everywhere is clicked as a destination.
2015,5,This app is super easy to use and is great for comparing flights and prices from a variety of sellers.
2015,1,The new update UI absolutely ruined this app.
2015,5,Everything I need.. not for low IQ .. Good for techyüòÜüòÜüòÜ
2015,5,I get to discover some amazingly cheap flights to exotic destinations with SkyScanner
2015,5,"Excellent app, but the new format a little confusing."
2015,1,A brilliant app utterly ruined by a needless redesign.
2015,5,Really enjoy to have the option for looking for the best and lowest fares!
2015,5,"Love it, though I would like to have push notification for prices"
2015,3,The new version is complicated unlike the old one.
2015,4,"Nice interface, easy to use."
2015,5,Feature rich easy selection options
2015,4,I like it  but do not give airline  maps
2016,5,"As the web site, really easy and helpful."
2015,5,Correct fare showing without any additional cost I guarantee
2015,5,latest update looks great . keep it up
2015,5,Easy to use and always finds me the best deals!
2015,5,"It is excellant app, pl add currency options"
2015,5,All relevant information  at your fingertips easy to use
2015,5,Good program very easy for use and good prices . Thanks
2015,1,Why mess about with a site that excellent and easier to follow?
2015,1,Can not search without the app closing
2015,5,This is my favorite app seeking information for airlines.
2015,1,Used to like it but update sucks got to find another app
2015,5,Excellent app. And cheapest -:)
2016,5,Helps alot. Thanks.
2015,1,After the new version it is just useless.
2015,2,More difficult than before.
2015,1,Rubbish since update needs putting back
2015,5,Excellent app keep up the great work
2015,4,This is a good app. Compare it with Kayak.
2015,1,"Old version was fantastic, new version is horrible."
2015,3,Got used to the update now.
2015,1,Fan for previous version. Current version is not use friendly compare to previous version.
2015,3,Previous version better.

2015,5,Reema Jeneidi
2015,1,Im all for moving with the times and embracing change but there has got to be a benefit in it....I used to use this everyday to plan my trips...updated it and now I don't actually think I'll bother with it again... I like the option to search everywhere and anytime and pick up good flight prices and be able to check different prices for different days...bring back the old version
2015,1,"The App was perfect as it was before. Now it has a million more add ons and steps to the process which really are rubbish. The flight price is now tiny, the text is tiny, it's no longer MOBILE friendly at all! Huge disappointment. I used to love the previous version."
2015,4,"You can't select the flights after you search? Maybe a bug, but it was great and now it's not. Well done. Edit: disregard the above. Temporarily buggy. Probably my phone. It's fine now. UI changes always take a while to get used to."
2015,1,I liked old version but current update has spoiled it. You can't select whole month. ...even if it is possible. . Still  not user friendly
2015,1,The changes are terrible. I had been relying on this app to plan my travels and without the price chart it is useless. Please reintroduce this feature. Loved this app and now I can't even use it!
2015,1,"HATE the new update. Older version was much much much simpler, user friendly and all out better. Do not upgrade if you haven't already."
2015,5,"This app just went from minging to penging. I love the new features. It would help if we could save flights in folders you know, like they do in Airbnb. But this is still great"
2015,3,"It shows 2 icons which 1 of it is useless, but I've try uninstall the useless one, the other became useless. Reinstall it and both appears back. But using it is OK, no problem so far.."
2015,1,You ruined a perfectly good app! This upgrade is terrible! Layout is not as simple to use. I used to love this app now I'm looking for alternatives.
2015,1,"What a horrible mess they have made of skyscanner. Overly complicated, I want to get flights...... That's it! You will learn. Uninstall"
2015,1,100% Loved It Before The  Update Now I 100% Hate it why did they have to get rid of suc h an easy to use helpful app to one that's just pure CR**
2015,4,New layout is amazing..  Just don't understand why you don't offer multi destination
2015,1,"I always thought updating an app meant it would be better,  but not with this app. It's confusing & hard to use now."
2015,2,"Earlier version was much better n user friendly,how can I get the earlier version back"
2015,1,Before i can see all the flight I operated flights to my city and booking sites also after update nothing.pls pls do something likes before
2015,2,I don't like this latest update it isn't as user friendly as the previous version
2015,1,"You took a brilliant straight forward app, and killed it . was such a great app , I wish I could get back the previous version."
2015,4,"There used to be a feature online that showed u prices over a few days as a graph, made it super easy to compare prices"
2015,2,Can't change the date of my flight search from Nov 5th which is a pain when I'm looking for a flight for today!
2015,4,Although this version is more graphic. The previous version was better in searching and had more info.
2015,1,Update is complex and bad. Earlier it was simple and quick.
2015,1,Old version was better . If it's not broken don't fix it
2015,1,"So good now uninstalling, was using regularly, no longer"
2015,4,I always use this to search flight whenever I plan traveling.
2015,5,One of the best apps in market to book flights & compare prices all over the internet
2015,4,App is good but ehy no have multiply option ?
2015,5,This is the best app you can find to search cheap flights.
2015,4,Good app for travellers seeking ticket Bargains
2015,4,Still the best and simplest Flight finder app
2015,5,"Cool app, it's so easy for use."
2015,1,This was a great app but the new user interface is terrible.
2015,5,Very good app with full of details of flights and joirney timing
2015,5,Latest update makes the app so much better
2015,1,New version  is very complicated to use and confusing
2015,4,It's make us to be simple.
2015,5,A great app! I love it!
2015,5,Right price and fast to find out and pay
2015,5,Haven't found an app as great as this!
2015,4,Very good to compare flights
2015,4,Download this app! A must have!
2015,4,nice booking site
2015,1,Totally disappointed!
2015,5,Very good app!!!
2015,5,Always providing useful information

2015,5,Beats kayak and google flights
2015,4,Sepp
2015,5,Awlad
2015,5,Dope app
2015,1,"Used to be my go-to app for flights, but latest update is awful. We just need 1 page with ADEP / ADES / Dates / no of travellers.. Not a whole load of pages and screens where info needs to be constantly updated. Please revert to old version or at least make latest update more user friendly. It's horrendously bad in its current format. Uninstalled."
2015,1,"I used to use this with confidence now It can't be trusted. ...the prices are never accurate ..it's just untrustworthy. Also to all users beware your phone will be slower using this  latest update .myself and my coworkers 73 of us did an experiment pertaining to the speed of the phone once updated the phones became slow..  if anybody knows a different app let it be known, as we the consumers are the ones who keep these app developers in business."
2016,2,"While choosing d flight always getting error ""Search requires an Internet connection. plz check ur settings"" though it has high bandwidth connection, this occurs in new and old versions, plz fix d bug. New  version user interface was not up to d mark, info was not clear, I revert back to older version of  v2.0.18 which had best user interface. Hope u fix it."
2015,1,Oh dear. What have you done? Clumsy interface. No option for direct flights. You can't flip direction of departure/destination airports. Hate colour coded price bands - prefer to see actual cost. Reverted to old version of app.
2017,1,"Basically rendered itself useless after the revamp.  I used to LOVE this app,  because I could quickly and easily search cheapest dates to fly to my destination on a calendar.  Now that doesn't exist and it's just trying to be another cheap travel site. Uninstalled."
2016,2,"Edited for clarification:  Deselected airlines still show up in the results when another airline does the outbound or inbound flight, respectively. Even if you deselected BOTH the out- and inbound airline of a search result, it still shows up.  An NO, I don't want to deselect ""Multiple Airlines"". I have no problem with ""Multiple Airlines"" in my Roundtrip, I have a problem with specific airlines."
2015,3,"It's quite good,  except that prices tend to go up when you look a longer time and then again when you finally book. Booking your flights directly with the carrier usually is cheaper. And why the heck does a flight search engine need access to my data/storage on the phone?"
2015,2,"I have just uninstalled as the new version wants too much access to my phone, you don't need it to look up flights, too invasive. Going elsewhere. 29/Nov/15 ...still asking for same permission on update, I thought this was being removed?"
2016,1,"You post flights and their prices,yet when you go to book your fare the app or god knows whoevers in control does the total opposite. For eg me and my family wanted a single flight from NZ to Australia we see air china at at a price of $1,200- $1,350 which is reasonable then you click to book it'll take you to jetstar or quantas at a ridiculous price it done this multiple times, In contrast would not recommend this app to any frequent flyer, found a better app which promises what they show...Horrible app"
2015,3,"I love Skyscanner, it provides up to date prices and it's easy to use. However, recently I've been encountering some problems - I can't do a new search. Every time I click the back button, I would expect to be on the search page but the app just closes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, help for a while but the same problem occured. I'm sure this is just a minor technical glitch. Overall, my experience with Skyscanner have been great and I've booked nearly all my tickets using this application!"
2016,1,"I dont know what your business policy is , but one thing i want to suggest you that any business doesnot last long when became fraud/ fake . fake avertisement and promises is your business's backfoot. So doesnot make forcefully to use your apps by advertising that you will get 10 rs for downloading and using ( via reward money apps ) it have a negative status towards your company. So going to uninstall."
2015,1,I'm so excited about this app...but it doesn't work! !! Sad Face! It keeps telling me that my time zone is incorrect...my sister dl'd it too...its telling her the same thing. When i try to search for flights no matter what it tells me my time zone day and time are not correct. Is this a glitch in the update?
2015,1,"Been trying to get used to but could not. New interface impossible to navigate through. Search, navigation, selections, just everything is bad. Cannot use this properly for flight search. Completely not fit for purpose anymore. Uninstalling."
2016,5,I had a bit of a price discrepancy after I searched for a domestic flight. After sending a message to Skyscanner alerting them of the problem they assigned one of their technical representatives to reply to my complaint. Helped the best they could to my satisfaction and sent a follow up email. Best customer service thanks Skyscanner.
2015,3,The price u end up paying isnt always whats dhown on skyscanner. The random array of travel agents all have their own quirky ways of adding to your ticket total. In the end ive found several times that booking through the airline would have been cheaper. Still its a good app that gives you a good overview of whats available at what times just be aware you wont always get the p4ice thats shown in the end
2015,3,"I wondered why my scanned flight trip is not the same with my friend scanned flight trip. Both scanned the same day for the same destination flight. But mine is more expensive. I checked the ticket online, and some price were different than the result I got in the app. The function is good but Im not satisfied with the scanned result. Im using it on Android."
2015,1,After new update it doesn't work. What is the point creat update when its not working. I had this app for 6 month and all was excellent. Just today it went from good to absolute crap. Fix it please and I will give you 5 stars. Now its for minus 5 stars.
2016,2,"First opened app and game multi city choice. But when I came back later, only round trip. What good is that and why one moment it does and next time not? Checked every setting I could think of but nada"
2016,1,I used to be able to select where I was traveling from and the dates and I'd have options of available flights for multiple destinations. That was what made skyscanner better than all the other sites. Now it's no use for searching for random/spontaneous deals.
2015,2,"Similar apps,  like KAYAK, apart form the flight number also show the aircraft type of the specific flight... Would be a great feature to have.  And the new UI is great,  it just needs improvement"
2016,3,It is neat and easy to use... when it works. Every couple of days it stops working and shows the message that the app needs to be updated BUT THERE IS NO UPDATE AVAILABLE
2015,1,This company releases your credit card details to associated airlines and do not honour their quotes. Customer service is absolutely atrocious and disputes do not get resolved. 2 payments go out on separate dates with amounts that vary to what has been quoted. Skyscanner is terrible and should not be trusted with credit cards!!!!
2015,1,"App needs new permissions identity (accounts on the device, profile data) but you do not explain why. Until explenation is added in readme 1 star remains. I do not sacrifice privacy unless you have a very good reason why I should"
2015,3,"A multi city option would be helpful. Also a more advanced search with flight times and airlines, etc could prove useful. Another problem i have had is that prices changed from the chart to the next screen sometimes."
2016,3,Very easy to use ! Very nice apl. But it's not always accurate to find cheapest flights! Just booked a flight that skyscanner price was 760 euro at 220 euro!
2015,5,"Love this feature. Rest of the app works fine. Every now brings up some promo prices that you can't actually get, seems more of a hoax from the ticket provider though so can't fault skyskanner for that."
2016,3,Since couple of months the app doesn't match the best price it offers. Once you chose from chart the best price it increases when is updated. Moreover is not including the low cost airlines as vivacolombia or airpanama
2015,4,Based on reviews of latest version...I'm not going to update for fear of it ruining what I'm using currently. Why change anything? It works so well already.
2016,1,I can't view flight details as it prompts me to check my connection settings. It says this needs internet connection to work when in fact I have internet access. The similar app on my device doesn't have any issues like this and works perfectly fine.
2015,1,Won't search for any flights?? Always used skyscanner before and found it was the only way to search for flights but with this app I haven't even been able to look at my options! Been trying for days.
2016,4,Its great app and I am always using skyscanner to find great deals for my flight. Its just a shame that we cannot access the same features as the one available on the website with the app like multi city trip!
2016,2,"The website does car hire and hotels as well. For some reason these have been broken out into different apps. Keep the app consistent with the website, please."
2015,1,"Today's update means the app stops working telling me I have an outdated version. Only solution to delete and reinstall, so now lost all history"
2015,1,This app was good before but now it sucks. Before the ticket prices were accurate and the times were as well. Now the times arent always and the ticket prices never are. You see one price but when you go to buy it the actual price is much more. This app has become useless and unreliable.
2015,5,"I've noticed a lot of people have complained about the new update but I've only just got the app, so for me this is all I know and it's been highly useful for finding the cheapest flights and cheapest surrounding dates to fly out and return on! I would recommend."
2015,5,"Very good app but needs a custom search like this: ""everywhere to a country"". Already exist ""country to everywhere"" but not ""everywhere to a country"". For a lot of people would be nice and useful if it will be in the next update. Thanks :)"
2015,5,It shows cheaper  domestic flights in other countries which is really awesome and good to plan well in advance. Easy UI and much convenient than other apps to search domestic flights in other countries. 5* for sure. Hope this app stays the same.
2016,4,Can we go back to the flight page directly? I know the company probably makes money with hotels but the reason we love the app is ONLY because the flight search feature.
2015,1,finds 500 EUR flights that in reality end up costing over 1000 EUR. I reported this same problem month ago. Obviously they can't get their system fixed. Totally unreliable.
2015,1,This is my prior comment - Maybe they could help Facebook with the correct way to design an app. Now no more.  It used to list the return prices. No longer. Why change it??
2015,1,"Every time I search, this notice  pops up this app require internet connection check your setting. However my connection is working fine. I have used this app in two device same problem"
2015,1,It's not doing what it's supposed to do. Most of the days come out blank without any prices and you actually have to click on everyday to compare the days. Fix it!!
2015,1,"I uninstalled this app because it requires access to your device's photos and videos (not sure why) and your identity information (also not sure why.) I understand why it needs Location access, but not these other things..."
2015,2,I did a search MSP to MIA and it came up with 2 airline choices and I had no filters. My husband found more on Google and a cheaper flight by $75. Fail.
2015,2,"This is a good, but only weird thing is that you people don't add country taxes. The prices here are not the prices you get when you call to book. They will tell you the prices here don't include taxes. I think you should work on that so that someone finds out the exact prices here"
2015,5,Gets you the best and cheapest deals fast. Best choice of airlines and great layout of app. Easy to use and book. Really appreciate the bar graphs for comparisons.
2015,5,This is the main app I use for finding flight deals. Way better than any other app/website.  Especially if you don't care when you travel.
2016,5,Great app. I always check prices on this. I really like the feature that allows you to look for flights from a particular airport to anywhere in the world without having to specify the destination in advance.
2016,3,"There's no multi-city button for this app. Update: Other than no multi-city, it is a great app. Thanks for the fast respond."
2015,5,Keep in mind sometimes the prices are cheaper when you click the book by phone option. It said my round trip was $560 but it was actually only $400 taxes in :)
2015,1,I was trying to baying a Ticket but its gave  there is something wrong and notify me to check my email address! !! even i don't  know  if it took something from my account? ?! its was strange
2015,3,"Love the thoroughness of the search. Needs the ability to continue to view your search offline. When offline it forces you to refresh your search losing the info until online again.  Also, needs the ability to search using multiple destination or arrival airports."
2015,4,Overall the application works fine for searching the cheap flights. I think it can be improve further if it has new features like - break journey.
2015,4,Use this app every yr when i book my holidays. Pretty annoyed after updating it its not working at all. Would love to see it fixed
2015,5,"Skyscanner is how I've booked my past 5 years worth of travel, I wouldn't bother with anything else now because I know I'll always get the cheapest airfare this way. Love the way you can scan through the dates to see if you left the next day your flight might be half the price. Love love love it!"
2015,2,Much preferred the old way of searching for flights where you could select the time of the outgoing and incoming separately. this way you have to trawl through loads of flights flights to find the ones suited  to you. now I just search direct with the airline
2015,2,I used this app constantly in the past but more recently its advertised pricing is just to far out. Today i looked at a BA flight advertised on sky scanner at ¬£115 when I went to purchace it rocketed to  ¬£284 sky scanner need to be more up to date!
2016,5,I'm able to see all the flights in one place with lots of filters. It even includes Southwest airline. The prices are so helpful.
2016,5,It's simple accurate and user friendly. Since I have installed this app I'am using it to check the best offred price and also book my flight tickets.
2016,5,Best way to search all flight operators. Just some times price is higher when go to the site. Not often enough to concern me though.
2016,3,The previous version was simple and more user friendly...in this version I face lot of  bugs and some confusion on flight booking and also stop showing Ryanair flights
2015,5,I had been using it since year 2012. I even use it as the search engine for all tickets comparison for my thesis. It never let me down. It is highly recomended to use. I recommended to all my frens n family. Thz skyscanner.
2015,5,"Love this app, allows searches for flights with all available airlines through lots of different agents to find best possible flights to suit time, budget and preferred route, direct or with stop-offs.   Love the facility to seach whole month, to view best prices over a range of dates.  Have recommended to many colleagues and friends."
2015,5,"One of the best travel app, deals with my airlines in order to provide you with the cheapest price. It's only missing the loyalty program with its users"
2015,1,"This version is more difficult to use and not as convenience as the previous version, when u do upgrade version, u choose keep the good and improve the bad, this is quite disappointed! Bring back the old version ...please."
2016,5,Always gets me the cheapest flight at the times I want. Or I can view the cheapest flights in a month. This is awesome. Better than booking directly.
2015,5,"The smartest tool to search flights EVER!! The only thing that can be updated is the option to include ""everywhere"" in the ""from"" option, to for instance, search from where is the best place to flight to London"
2015,4,"Always gets me the best fare in one place, without need to search in multiple sites. Would love to have multicity option."
2016,1,"This app doesn't work.  I receive an error message saying I'm not connected to the net, whilst everything else works."
2015,5,Thats how a phone application should look like. Gr8 job. But why no Israel's currency? (ILS)
2015,5,This has become my go to app for flight bookings. A great UI & best pricing & timing options. Love it.
2015,4,Very easy to use. I think they should come up with a better way to compare different flights where you don't have to open and switch between new windows all the time
2015,5,"Love this app.  The only one that allows you to search without putting in arrival and departure dates, so flexible and helpful! Found flights from Texas to Colorado for $78!  Score!"
2015,5,Love this app is pretty accurate.  What I  recommend for those who do round trip is to check round trip prices and one way prices for each way and compare the best. It helps a lot! :-D
2015,5,..especially if you are flexible with travel options... just searching places to everywhere and plan a trip around the cheapest deals!
2015,5,"This is the only app that I've found that treats its users with respect, and tries to provide data- not find ""deals""."
2015,3,"Nice, but I wish it would be the same good as one for ios. E.g. maps view is super feature to have."
2015,1,"There is no reason for this app to require Identity permission. I have contacted their support, they claim it is needed for Google sign-in, which is incorrect."
2015,1,last version is very student-made. i will not update until you bring back old ui.
2016,4,Only improvement I can think of is price drop notifications for saved flight searches - but I use this app regularly!
2015,3,Great for finding flights. Just don't book through the app. You don't get a confirmation and by the time you get through to find out the flight will be full.
2016,1,Now ruined by annoying promotion texts to your phone. Bad enough that they made the flight search function so convoluted.
2015,4,Perfect app to use when looking to just get out of town.  Wish name of destination would appear next to airport code at top of flight selection page.
2015,1,"Why exactly and how do we prevent these intrusions? Brilliant functionality, simple to use. What more could anyone want?"
2016,5,"I just booked a mega cheap flight and i'm very glad that this app exist.great job guys,thank you"
2015,5,They finally fixed the issue where we cant see flights ahead of time. Thanks for the quick response and fix.
2016,5,"Love this app, it finds what dates I need at low rates every time. My favorite is the chart showing pricing for dates around your selected dates, it's so helpful when you have flexibly to get the lowest rate"
2016,5,"Flexible, easy to navigate, able to change payment country and payment currency. I found my last plane tickets using this app and it beat everything I found using other Internet-based services."
2015,5,Very impressed with how this app works. When trying to get to a funeral it was invaluable to quickly find the best flight to and from the location.
2016,2,The app is stuck on the one flight and I can't search for anything else. Even if I reset the app.
2016,1,Cannot register or log into any account using my email or Facebook it keeps trying to reset my password then telling me I'm using an invalid link what a joke and total waste of time
2015,4,Use this app for few years and each time found good deal. Thanks!
2016,2,Why don't have multiple route option? Only round trip and one way.
2015,4,Great deals. Low prices. Definitely recommend.
2015,2,Can't get the explore option like the one available on iPhone. Disappointing really.
2015,5,Great app. Easy to use and to help visualize results quickly with lots of options!
2015,5,Up to date info all the time and gives me so much inspiration! Select to go anywhere and it comes up with a list of crazy places to fly to in price order!!
2016,5,"I simply love ""watched"". It helps me a lot to find the best and cheapest flights"
2015,5,Have been using it since 2012 and Works excellent! Gives me the best offers!
2015,1,Why this new update needs access to my media files?!! No way that I am alowing this....
2015,2,"When I select my departure airport, the return flights emediatly go up. Can you say ""Bait and Switch."
2015,5,Love this app It's Very ease to use and have great deals.. Thank you
2015,3,This app needs to have multiple destinations option so I don't have waste time going on a PC to book a multi city flight.
2015,5,Cuando se trata de vuelos siempre comparo. Esta aplicacion de verdad compara bastantes aerolineas. Resulto que habia vuelos mas baratos y con aerolineas diferentes a las que encontraba en expedia o despegar. Totalmente feliz
2015,4,easy to use. not complicated. a must-have for any traveler.
2015,2,"I have no idea what is going wrong, but it is showing completely out of the world prices... compared to google flights :-/"
2016,5,"So far I haven't found anything that can beat Skyscanner, and having it in such a well crafted app is just super!  :)"
2015,5,This is a great travel companion app. Overall view plus customisable alerts. Keep up the great work Dev Team
2015,5,I had a family emergency I needed to travel across from the east to the north and it located all the connecting flights that I needed it set up my itinerary and I pay I paid the low the average of what the flights were going for...
2015,5,Older version were much better..i can't even get notifications for prices
2016,5,Results are not so accurate when one chooses all dates or all possible destinations. That is also understandable. The rest is great!
2015,5,"Perfect in so many ways. Fast, light weight, and entertaining"
2015,5,The update is very good but their is no option of direct flights individually without flights with stops.
2015,4,Very happy with app. Does as its website. Cheap tickets
2015,1,Why O why.... Fix something that is not broken....???? Was probably the best App on its class and now....#\'(!!.
2016,2,"Wanted an alternative to kayak but can only do return or one way, not multi destination... Back to kayak!"
2015,5,This app is good for the traveller. But sometimes lost connection in phone and pc.
2015,1,I don't like new version. Old one was more understendible
2015,5,It's my first place to search and the best. Better than expedia. Love it.
2015,5,"Perfect for scanning prices but always prefer to book directly with airline company rather than ""e-travell agencies"" that will always add hidden costs and sometimes down right rip you off."
2015,5,"Made reservations. Worked well, saved dollars.  If flight goes well will continue  to use a lot."
2015,5,App works great.  Will get the lowest prices available.
2015,5,Amazing prices. Hassle free app!! No complaints here :-)
2015,5,Awesome app.  Compares most sites and gives best deal.
2015,5,uninstalled and reinstalled fixed it. many thanks. :-)
2015,2,"Not reliable at all. The date shows cheap price, when u click in the detail shows doubled price!"
2016,1,Please revert to original user interface. New design is ugly and confusing.
2015,4,Can you add multi flights. The best app but just to make it more convenient and practical multi tab be so.much easier
2015,5,"Fluid, reliable and very good at finding flight times and cheap flights! Could do with improving how you change between tabs"
2015,5,Making it easy to have your travel agent honest. 1/2 by app. 1/2 agent...
2015,2,Why does skyscanner all of a sudden require my identity? Why can't changelogs be clear on not only the what but also the why?
2015,5,Please include a multi city travel option . It would be a great update
2016,1,Installed it because of a fake advertisement. I usually don't use such a crab.
2015,2,This app is great but I am disappointed cause the tunisian dinar is missing in the currency list. Plz add it.
2015,4,"Hoteles, vuelos, carros de todo solo have falta que te toquen el timbre y te lleven al avi√≥n :)"
2016,3,Pretty good except that I can't work out how to see multi city /open jaw itineraries
2015,5,I love it and prefer to my friends. Thank you developers.
2015,4,"I'd love it if it had an option to search for multi-city flights, not just one-way and roundtrip."
2015,1,Got no passport al give more stars if they can help me book flight whitout passport
2015,4,It works just fine some prices are not accurate but it's okay I already got the hang of it
2015,3,"Asking for too many permissions,  plenty of other apps do the job,  so delete."
2016,4,Nice and excellent work but air lines offer not display please improved this  problem
2015,3,I guess I'll just stick with the previous app while the new one gets wrecked.
2015,1,when i searched for flights to nyc and chicago it kept turnjng up blank though flights showed up on websites. what is wrong with this app?????
2015,4,It's pretty solid in doing what it says it does. Is clean and fast
2015,5,"Good app, good interface. Just perfect."
2015,4,"Why would the app suddenly require permission to access identity information and yet say nothing related to it in the ""what's new"" section?"

2015,4,the only problem that he offers the main countries air lines not all the air lines company it can be cheaper
2015,3,Would like to see more airlines but I suppose it depends on who pays to be on there site ?
2015,1,Must be in Mexican money. These tickets are outrageously over priced.
2015,4,Best flight planner ive used.Simple and easy to navigate and saves my faves for next time..

2015,5,Muy bien
2016,3,
2015,5,I've been using this app for a while and it's perfect! A lot of airlines and flights lot of prices! Love it!
2015,5,"Very nice  app, cheap prices."
2015,2,"This is usually my go-to app for finding flights. However, the last couple of days I have been trying to search it tells me that I have an older version and need to update the app. I go into the play store and it says the app is up to date. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it didn't fix issue."
2016,1,The old app allows you to see the pricing for an entire calendar month all at once rather than putting in specific dates. With this new revised version you have to search specific dates it's kind of a hit-or-miss trying to find the cheapest prices now. I deleted the app
2015,2,"I have to jump thru hoops to search for a flight. Hitting the search button takes me to the watched list.  -since the last update, I am able to search but now the app will show ""No Results"" for a particular flight on a given day. When I go to the full website, there are indeed flights for that day. For example, I was looking for a one way flight from DCA to CUN on 26 Sep and the app showed no results."
2015,4,I would give 5* if it's simiar as the website to enable search of multi-cities. Eg I want to go from Kuala Lumpur to Dublin and return from England to Singapore. If I have to book 2 segments it's rather cumbersome and one way is crazily expensive.
2015,4,Sometimes fails to give you the cheapest options so check every airport individually. 95% of the time it is not wrong. App is a great starting point
2015,5,"Cheapest way to find a flight and if you use hotel scanner aswell you can save more, you can see a graph and see what days are cheaper to fly, you would be surprise how much u can save, I've even checked other apps and sites to see if they was cheaper searches and I found this app is all you need! Thanks guys"
2016,1,Now is a crap. Used to be easy and SIMPLE to find flights. Now the app is overcomplicated not user friendly any more. Uninstalled and found some other alternative.
2015,5,"Works properly and give you almost the same versatility from the website.  I'm not sure if we have the option to do multiple flights on the app, but would be nice."
2015,5,Works great on my Galaxy Note 8 and my Note 3 phone. Never have an issue with the app. Process always match TripAdvisor. Live in Asia so valuable asset.
2015,3,"Hi skyscanner, when i make a search and then get the results, i try to filter the results with my prefered companies and or prefered hours. But the results don t update when i select ""save"", nothing happens.   What am I doing wrong....????"
2015,3,I found lots of better options in other Web pages and apps  like momondo. It was far from my expectation. It was difficult to find the option of  changing currency.
2015,4,Did helped me to save $$$. Please allow for updates to be sent as soon as the price is changed so we dont miss out on deals instead of sending alerts once a day.
2015,1,This app will cost you money. My Daughter's return flight from Sydney to Adelaide is $152 cheaper yes... $152 cheaper through the Skyscanner app.
2015,5,This app provides quick and accurate information on the cheapest airline. It works fast even on a slow Internet connection. Great job
2015,4,"Consistently getting the lowest prices compared to other flight apps, trends table is very useful, love the widget too. Only problem I have found is you cannot use the widget if you move the app to your SD card."
2015,5,"Easy to nav. Have always used web version and it's as good as, no option limits as u get with most apps."
2015,4,Simple and easy to use. It just works! Great for holding 'price matching' travel agents to accountability!
2015,1,Always told flights were sold out. Tonight they still say they have those deals. I call bs
2015,3,Decent app but its not showing up any prices for the flight im trying to select for next year its just showing up various british airports with no prices. What am i doing wrong?
2015,5,My boyfriend lives in North Carolina and I live in Minnesota. Getting to see each other is expensive and rare with the app found plane tickets for less than 200 roundtrip. Needless to say i see him more nowüòÅ
2015,5,This app has been by far the most inexpensive for airfares. Not only do they post updated prices. They also work with a bundle of vendors to accomodate any Nomad.
2015,2,"I booked 2 flights through one of the web sites the redirected me and they canceled my flight 2 times hours before the flight, I had to use kayak instead and I didn't have any problem, more expensive tho....good app but bad experience for me"
2015,5,Great app. Definitely my favorite for booking and looking for flights. Easy and user friendly.
2015,1,This app completely fails. Every low price flight it shows is totally unavailable. I should have known better..!!
2015,5,The greatest thing to come along in a very long time. It doesn't get any better than this. I hope they will add the type of aircraft for each flight.
2015,4,Any chance for push notifications for price changes? Maybe notification when it hits a certain price? Widget is nice too
2015,3,"La aplicaci√≥n esta genial, pero hecho de menos una opci√≥n de e indicar un n√∫mero de d√≠as y una peque√±a flexibilidad +-2 d√≠as"
2015,4,"One thing that would very help is an option for a flexible flights in a given dates range, for example between 20.8 to 15.9 (like the 'whole month' but more flexible)."
2015,5,"It provides all available airlines and dates when your schedule is flexible. I still haven't bought a ticket yet, but I've compared it to the airlines website and this app shows the cheapest flight"
2015,5,I have been looking everywhere for an app like this! It is extremely easy to use and very accurate. I will never use anything else to find cheap flights!
2015,5,I have purchased several flight and am very happy with the deals I get. I have purchased flights in and out of the US and the app is super easy to use
2015,3,please add skywise and safair airlines to your search engines algorithm to get the most cost effective prices for the South African user / consumer using your application
2015,5,Great prices. I gave been using it to plan a vacation for next year I hope and you can't find round trip flights for under $300 almost anywhere
2015,4,Used this app to book many flights. Works good and seams to find fairly reasnable prices.
2015,4,Very good app. Easy to use. But u need to add the multi destination as well to it.
2015,1,The app is now useless and no longer works properly. Use the website or don't bother
2015,2,It won't go back to home search page. I stopped this app forced but it comes same again..
2015,4,I've found great deals using Skyscanner. Happy returning customer.
2015,5,"Need to improve more in every area of flights, low cost information also payment have to be done here not to redirect to Google Chrome."
2015,2,Once skyscanner used to be the one to find the cheapest but nowadays they are at least 10 to 20 % costlier than the other Apps available.
2015,5,Very good app. I always find the best combination with the best price. I recommend it 100%
2015,5,I've booked my airline tickets for a multi city journey for around 11 destinations and this app showed me 25-30% less fares than many more.Trust me this best
2016,1,So bad application why they need my information for use the application!!! I uninstalled the application üòÉ
2015,5,Thank you for all your hard work. Love the app
2018,5,Very helpful indeed. Makes it easy to plan trips in advance
2015,4,Thanks for the use... Pls can r respond to email forwarded on 02Sep...
2015,4,"So far so good with this app, i love how it track if prices have gone up or down since your last visit."
2015,5,Very easy to use. Never had a problem. Use it for all of my trips.
2015,5,My wife says that if I can use this app then it must be very good and so easy to use because I am more simple than a simple thing doing nothing!
2015,4,"Good app,  works well.  Usefull"
2015,5,I've saved thousands in fares thanks to this app.  I recommend to all my friends
2015,1,I'm very upset with myself for using this app it wasn't the cheapest price and it had a lot of hidden charges...I will not be using it again.
2015,4,"I love this app, seems like it does help finding best prices but when you go to check out the price raises"
2015,2,I can't see just one airline and it seems like there should be more flights available then viewable...
2015,5,It is simple to use and it searches the best deals. No more to say.
2015,4,Great app but it would be good if you added multiple destination option (more than 2)
2015,5,"I would recommend using an internet flight agent after selecting your price rather than phone, Ive only ever had problems with the latter"
2015,3,Could you please tell us why others Airlines doesn't show it or you don't have the flight information?
2015,3,"Good, could be better... Please add multi destination like on website."
2015,3,"It's a very nice app, just need to add more low cost companies"
2015,1,I can not get it to find any flights for any days or places. What am I doing wrong?
2015,4,Easy to filter your desired flight and time as well. I will surely recommend this to others
2015,2,Some airline names the print is so tiny you cant work it out seems someone has messed up the settings on sizing the print
2015,4,"Still one of the best app, however skyscanner used to be much better, especially offered more possibilities of airlines"
2015,3,I hope they make the price more down. ..thanks
2015,4,Would be nice to not trigger price alerts only because currency exchange rate has changed
2015,1,Not really a good app when you don't have a comparison of ALL the airlines from Atlanta.
2015,5,"Encontre el vuelo mas barato y solo en segundos, la mejor aplicacion se vuelos en el Mercado..  Bravo"
2015,5,Nice apps.. The travellers must get it to get a flight ticket and to grab for the best price....
2015,4,Searching for flights becomes easier but sometimes the price should be updated
2015,4,Better than the mobile website but still lacking some options.
2015,3,Need more extensive search as I do not see all airlines fares.
2015,4,"Starts searching for flights, you see a few come up and then an error message pops up and all the flights disappear."
2015,4,"I can't find arabic in this application. Why? Please, add it to the app."
2015,5,Low price you can get in this app.. Up date tiket love it
2015,5,Used a lot over the years. Only wish list is that you could add nearby airports make getting prices easier
2015,4,I really like the app and look forward ti booking some flights!
2015,5,Love this application. Thanks guys!!!
2015,2,The fly price on chart window grow twice when go to order window.
2015,5,Better than websites and it includes all the airline I know of. Very good indeed

2015,5,Excelente aplicaci√≥n a la hora de buscar pasajes aereos!! Me encanta :)
2015,5,Great app for cheap tickets
2015,5,great app so simple
2015,4,Nice
2015,5,Great app
2016,1,This was by far my favorite app for searching for flights due to its flexibility. Being able to leave the destination and travel dates open to quickly find low prices was great. The bar graph showing prices on several dates for each way made it easy to find the lowest price simply by selecting the travel date with the shortest bar. This new version took that take away. PLEASE REVERSE THIS UPDATE!
2016,1,"New interface makes it very unclear. They tried to clone Google flights. Uninstalling.            In reply to Skyscanner, I won't go through an entire procedure on your website to send a simple email. So I'll do it here. The interface is terrible and I refuse to use your app with it. I've used it for years until now. It's fubar."
2015,4,A great ap that does we hat it says. Its especially useful when you want to know prices to a place but don't even know which airlines fly there. The pricing system is a bit flaky but it is a good indication of the deals available.  I'd always go to the airline directly once I can see who looks cheapest.
2015,4,"I like the feature that it allows me to search without specifying dates so that i can fly on the day that is least costly.  However, I wish it will let me exclude airline/ airlines that I won't fly. For instance, when I search for flights from NY to Miami, frontier airlines persistently comes up as the least expensive.  However,  I don't fly that airline. So, it's sort of a waste of time to search for results that I will never use."
2015,4,I really like this app. It has helped save me a lot of money. What I don't like is when it shows me a low price and when I click on it a new browser comes up and the price is not even close to the price it showed me. That has mostly happened with Bravofly. When that happens it wastes me a lot of time plus I got excited for no reason.  I have changed travel plans because I end up losing out on a low fare. Otherwise the app can be very useful.
2015,3,"After reporting that it is really really slow, developer did something server side and asked me to try again. It is faster now.  New comments/requests:  display or link to fare classes and restrictions, airline filter option active before search (would speed up search)."
2015,3,Oh no! I loved the graph that made it really easy to see what days to travel and get the best deals. Now you can only search for particular dates just like every other search engine. Really disappointed as I loved that feature and was why I recommended it to everyone.
2015,4,"I like this app. Since I fly a lot, I think it will be very useful. I would like the ""watch"" feature to work a little better though. I filtered to see direct flights only, but when I add it to the watch list, it takes the lowest price flight which is a connection. I would like to be able to watch the applied filters."
2015,1,"The app is great for searching for flights. However, today when I really wanted to use it to book a flight, it directed me to the website where the flights were no longer available, TWICE!! It's obviously not in sync with the websites...I ended up using a search website on the PC and paying more than what Skyscanner had made me think I was going to pay. 1‚òÜ rating this time.."
2015,1,"Was in desperate need of a flight back home from another continent,  and every time I tried to pick a flight it would either drastically change in price, (up to 800%) or would then just say something went wrong and send me back to the main page.  This is not what I needed at that time.. these apps are supposed to make things easier and less stressful, not more."
2015,4,"Good app, but i am somewhat confused by some of the prices. On a return flight search you select your outbound and your return flights to give an overall total, all prices are displayed so you can choose the cheapest, however upon selecting your outbound flight all the return flights increase considerably. You are probably better off booking 2 seperate single flights. That aside its a useful app and saves do much time shopping around."
2015,4,"For a flexible traveller, you get to see the prices for other days close to your travel date, which is good. But many times these prices are not accurate, once you clicked on it and it takes you to the site for you to make the purchase, the prices suddenly went higher. I fly long distance every couple of months, and have seen this happen many times. This app is good to get the estimate price for the flights, but be aware that it might not be the price charged to you in the end."
2015,4,Great app but needs multi search functionality to get 5 stars. Also can not search anytime in a month like online. When you select anytime it searches a whole year. Frustrating as you need to search daily. Also no option to eliminate airlines like Malaysia Airlines.
2015,1,"Skyscanner redirected me to Bravofly to pay for my ticket, but upon paying for my ticket, I received an error from my bank's website, and I have no way of knowing whether it went through or not.  I didn't get any confirmation e-mail, so now I worry I will get charged for no ticket! :("
2015,4,"Everysince i got the app it feels like a game, and the objective is to find how many places i can go with spending an arm and a leg. Thank you Skyscanner! Now lets get better about those hotel and flight deals."
2015,4,Does what it claims. Consistently finds the best prices. Two issues though. 1. I'd like to be able to exclude given airlines before searching. and 2) I'd like to be able to set up alerts for a period of time (e.g. 5 days either way on departure and return dates) not just a single pair of days. Then it would be 5* :)
2015,5,"Great application, user friendly and helpful when trying to make a fast choice on where to go.   Although I do give positive feedback on the app I can see one implement or one idea that maybe be beneficial! Sometimes people just want a spontaneous holiday or getaway for a weekend or a week , so maybe another section for last minute bargains that could be gotten."
2015,1,"I have been using this app for some time now and recently it just stopped showing most of the airlines. It only shows me US Airways, American Airline, and multiple airlines. Went through all settings and even tried uninstalling/reinstall and still the same. I travel 2 - 3 times a week and this was a reliable app for a short time and now went down the tubes."
2015,1,I'll just say this......as soon as I booked a flight my credit card company called me to a fraud alert!  They couldn't give me a confirmation number 48 hours later and I was flying in 12 hours.after 3 calls and hours on hold I decided to call credit card company to dispute the changes. ...
2015,1,"I had to buy two tickets, first one never went through, the second one after a comfirmation and calling the airline I could not get through to anyone that spoke English. Prices are good if you are willing to sit on hold for almost a week to get through to someone on the phone to speak with."
2015,2,I dont know why i can't search after pick place n date. Keep saying no data while it works fine on website. Re install for second time and still the same.
2015,4,"This app finds and prices a wide variety of flight options. It is easy to use. It would be good to add a flexible date option (if is there, it is not obvious) and an open jaw option."
2015,2,"I have booked a lot of flights through this app and have had very good service. But one provider of flights (edreams) was the absolute worst choice I could have ever made. They didn't give me my flight that I had paid for so I had to book through somebody else, and now they won't even give me a refund for the flight that I didn't even have a seat on."
2015,2,"Your application runs very slow on my LG G3. It used to search very quickly,but in the past 2 weeks,it runs very slowly. My internet speed is normal,my phone still has a lot of memories. Please help. Thanks"
2015,2,"Why is it that when I select an outward date from the monthly chart, most of the return dates become either unavailable or more expensive, and when I select a return date first, most of the outward dates become either unavailable or more expensive? This makes finding the best deal much more frustrating and difficult than the at-a-glance layout would suggest."
2015,1,"Found too good to be true pricing in the date picker, and then the prices doubled by the time I got to checkout.  Google's web tool for flight searches is much better."
2015,5,I have brain cancer and am planning on flying to missouri next month to see an old friend. I have been checking daily and I am hoping the prices are still good once I have the money to fly. But I like this concept so far so good. :-)
2015,2,Loved it at first especially the floght tracker widget. When i tried to book i found out that prices do not match search results and links to agencies/airlines don't always work which makes it a meaningless scanner.
2015,4,"Hi Skyscanner folk, I reinstalled app as suggested and it works perfectly now.   Thanks for the tip,  Derek  _________________________________________________ """"When I tap the departure field, the screen changes for me to type, but nothing comes up as I type and search, rendering the app useless, completely."""""
2015,5,"This app is phenomenal! Why, because the any day, any where search is simply the best.  Have a dozen booked flights because of it and it's very addicting. But hey deals are here and the search is very user friendly.  Love it!!"
2015,5,"Love that it includes Southwest.  Also, the bar graph option is great to check the best days to fly to/from specific destinations. Just wish you could search nearby airports using this feature."
2015,1,"Just installed this app... no good.  The lowest flight it shows for 12/31/14 - 01/04/2016 from CMH to SAN is $532. Numerous other sites online show a $417 ticket.  When I looked at the airlines to see why it wasn't offering this ticket, it was no wonder... it's only searching four airlines!  AA, SW, United, and ""Multiple.""  Obviously it isn't searching Delta."
2015,4,"Good app, only issue I have with it is that the shortcut no longer exists on my home screens...you have to go in through the app store. Rather strange. Never seen this before, was never an issue in the past."
2015,3,"I use to use this app a lot but I've noticed it no longer shows Delta flights...... I just uninstalled the app and reinstalled it.  Delta shows up now, but the prices are inaccurate prices are usually no less than $1,200"
2015,2,"When I first installed this a few months ago it worked great! I've booked a couple flights with this app. Now, all it does is tell me no results for flights no matter where I search flights for."
2015,4,The app works fine and I think it is a great app. I think the problem you are having is that we don't trust anymore the prices shown after a few searches as it is known that prices tend to increase when you repeatedly search for a flight.
2015,1,"Ok to find prices, but don't plan on getting a reservation confirmation for 24 hrs (if at all).. then don't call them as they are no help and direct you to the airline and you can find yourself in the middle and it's ridiculous trying to get your money refunded."
2015,4,Was highly recommended by a few friends whom tried & tested this app.It was able to check & compared to other flights/hotel availability. Was very happy & useful for an very impromptu trip I used recently.. thumb upüòâ
2015,5,2 suggestions: The list of destinations or cities should be smarter. Especially the last viewed destination and destination city. A map would be also helpful to plan an trip with many legs to cover a region.
2015,3,Tjereis an issue after the new update.  It is almost impossible to get the main screen.  It keeps in memory the last search and denies to go back to the home screen
2015,3,love the app. simple and easy to use... however sometimes  the price listed in the search is different to when the airlines are loaded. ive tried refreshing it a few times and still get the same issue
2015,1,"Even though I find terrific deals, it won't let me book the flights. What a scam!!!  I may as well book straight through the airlines themselves."
2015,1,As others said before pricing is very incorrect $100 minimum more than it shows that also local flights! And you get standard reply from the team to check their website! I checked ADL to Hobart flights
2015,4,"Would give five stars if i could exclude an airline from the results.  Poor service low cost airlines are included in the results, and it takes time to ignore these in the results.  There are airlines I will never use again!"
2015,4,Wonderful just it has more options.  Like flexible days for price comparison like other sites and also multiple countries.  It only has one way and return
2015,1,Not having the ability to search multi-city flights makes the app worthless for me. Don't know why this feature wouldn't be available for the US market.
2015,2,Had this app for years n loved it was very useful. This time looking for flights the prices are totally inaccurate. Eg skyscanner says the price for 3 people is 294each then when you click it it shoots up to ¬£1068 total ???? Frustrating !!!
2015,5,"Great flight booking app. Shows you flights and prices for more than three months, unlike other web apps that only shows you a week's range. Area of opportunity: Hope you can include more (local) flights. Some promo flights are not listed there."
2015,1,I searched same date flights using phone app and through desktop. Prices appeared on the phone app were different from what I got using my desktop. Huge price discrepancy.
2015,5,Amazing for finding cheap flights for travelling. Better than most travel agents for getting what you want struggles at multiple connecting flights some times but you just need to search the flights individually and sometimes you get a better deal that way.
2015,4,"I really like this app. Used it 2 years ago to find my flight to ireland, and using it now for a flight in the US. Prices aren't concrete because airlines are always changing their prices, but this gives you a good estimate on how much a flight could cost."
2015,1,"Wherever I am looking for tickets in the any day mode, I see really good prices. If I click them, the real price is 4 times more expensive!"
2015,5,Booked my holiday through this app and saved myself about ¬£300 only issue is that my flight is with air france and had to pay extra to take a case but and extra ¬£28 for a case is nothing compared to what I saved! I will happily use this app for future trips and would recommend this to anyone! 5‚òÜ
2015,4,"I should have give 5 but it is not perfect. So consider my 4 as a 4.8 Great app, I use it all the time, it even replaced the other I used, although sometimes the prices shown as nothing to do with the price once on the airline website (main problem)"
2015,5,Great way of tracking flights for a planned trip.  Regular messages alert you to price changes whether they go up or down. Ability to track multiple airports for the same destination is a real plus if you live in a major metropolitan area like NYC
2015,3,Would be brilliant if there's an alert option for a period of time not just for the specified departure and arrival. Would need an alert for price changes in 2016.
2015,5,I like this app. Bcoz there is a option to search flight without a fixed date. That is really helpful to find a date to travel @ cheap.
2015,4,"When I've looked up flight costs on here, like the website, it's not always 100% up to speed with price changes but will pick up the latest info when you select a flight & go to the seller sites. Also, it used to show cheaper alternatives if you were to fly a day either side of your selected date or from nearby alternate airports-that seems to have gone :-( a useful part of a search I found."
2015,4,The user interface is very easy to navigate and I love that there is a recent searches feature. Also has cheaper flights than the websites I used to use.
2015,4,"First of all, love the app, great job. One little question, whenever I search for 'any day', some days get an arrow instead of prices. What do these mean? Thanks in advance."
2015,5,Sometimes i dream of traveling place  to place by always picking the next destination from the everywhere results. When i really am traveling this is my go to. Thank you sky scanner!
2015,5,"If there's one essential travel app its this. I travel around 5-10 times a year, every year and this app has proved invaluable. Used it in May to plan a complex trip around Central Asia to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan... worked a treat. I'd rate it 6 stars personally, download it!!"
2015,3,Easy to use and never crashes but it's prices are all too often incorrect when you go to check out. The bar graph prices are hardly ever available.  Quite a disappointing experience every time.
2015,5,This app is just what i needed. . It help me in my bussy schedule to find flights and other good options ... loved it.... grt job....
2017,1,new version does not allow anymore flexibility where and when to go... really upsetting!!! could you plz make it how it was?
2015,1,"no matter what I search for I get no results. it seems they just want you to sign up. I switched the days, destinations,  everything. useless app."
2015,1,"Although i really like the sky scanner website, the app is awful.  Getting stack and for the same search the results can be the relevant flights or ""no results"", in minutes."
2015,5,The layout is excellent.  Clear option to opt for other agents selling same/similar tickets.  Impressive and practical.
2015,5,"Works good, no bullshit n helps you find the best prices.. Barcelona Sydney 300 euros :) Catcha the sunshine"
2015,5,The app is working well and easy to use. It has saved us lots of money already. Thank you!
2015,5,Hopefully some drop kick out there can learn from this app. It is very simple to use  and does a good job . The drop kicks out there who design some complicated app that is good for nothing take note of this one
2015,5,"This app always has the best prices. I've booked 6 flights this year alone via skyscanner. Never had any problems with it. Allows you to search through to find the best dates, routes & prices."
2015,5,"It's easy to use. I used this once and use skyscanner often to get cheap and reliable tickets. But, it would be great if you can make tickets sorting cheap 1st and then duration as second."
2015,4,"I really love their search engine and the app had worked well for me. I wish there were more advanced search options, however."
2015,2,"I have saved a couple of watched searches but when i go to search it wont let me, it stays on my watched searches. When I'm on the watched searches screen and I click the search tab, it stays on my watched searches and never goes to the search tab so I can't enter in a new search."
2015,4,"This is a great app except i would like to see prices for every day, rather than the circle with the downward caret. Would also be great to search multi cities, but it's a free app so i know i can't ask for everything"
2015,3,It is a good  app  and  many  choices  but hard to find  full  details till you  give your  personal information .  I wanted to  choose the airline  with  30 kg check in  baggage and  couldn't  find it. I  decided to  look  some other agent  and found  what I  wanted.
2015,5,"Love this app. Best prices on airline tickets. Compare pricing, watch for price changes, book flight and even pick your seat! :-) no fees for booking throughout Skyscannet!!"
2015,5,"Sometimes not super accurate, but extremely useful to save you time. The app is just as good as the website! Really well done."
2017,2,WizzAir flights do not show up in this app while in others I can see them. WizzAir is low cost and for certain destinations a good choice.
2015,1,It says this app requires internet connection check your setting i have checked it the internet is working fine i dunno maybe there is a glitch my phone is note 4 lollipop updated
2015,1,Skyscaner is good for to search price but sorry to say when we click to buy the itenary there no such itenary  for e.g.mum - JFK - mum it showed Egypt air as mum Cairo Egypt air 39 hrs flight & JFK mum air India non stop flight but we click it shows both ways Egypt air here there is no option to post screen shot as proof..
2015,5,I simple love it. I went to south america trip for 5 months by finding incredible cheap tickets from skyscanner. Thank you
2015,5,"Love this app, due to ease of use and no commission pricing so you always get a good deal. Thanks and keep up the good work"
2015,3,Once I click to book the prices already raised and now when I click search it takes me to the watched screen so I have to go search on a computer to save it to my watched list on the app. Haven't attempted to book through it yet.
2015,4,Seems to do what is says. Proof will be seen when I try and buy flights at the prices shown. I might come back and change my rating!
2015,2,Have booked 3 flights using Skyscanner only to have the flights cancelled. Got my money back two weeks later but had to buy more expensive flights in the meantime.
2015,4,Easy-to-use and helpful! No issue so far. Bue haven't done the booking yet.. Let's see later!
2015,3,App is awsome. But Bahraini Dinar is not available in currency option. Please fix that problem asap.
2015,5,"Does exactly what it's designed to do. Great, helpful and on you the users side always. 10 out of 10."
2015,5,Easy to use. Not like windows8 lol. Easy to filter flights. And cheapest prices on app. Thanks builders
2015,2,"The idea is great. The app is good. But the problem is that prices are not accurate. When you use the time line and select dates, the final prices always changes."
2015,5,"It does what I need it to do. The best feature is that I am able to look at prices on a big scale, so I can optimize my economy."
2015,4,Very easy app to use and very helpful...just a very slight change in prices when connecting to actual company. Have used the app to book car hire and flights a few times.
2015,5,This app lets you plan round-trip purchases by seeing the prices in a range of dates and choosing two. It is exactly what a flight app needs to be. Great work!
2015,5,Great app which I use to book all my flights!  Love the ease of use and the option to set up price alerts.
2015,3,"It's a good app, except I got one price for a return journey in the app , and a another one on the wizzairsite . Difference is more than double .. from 130 to 290 pounds from app to website ."
2015,2,When you're logged in and you try to access the search tab it's always bringing you back to the watched one. It's impossible to perform new searches please fix.
2015,4,"Great app, I use it frequently as I am required to fly at least 2-3 times per month for work and need convenience and affordability.. this assist with both."
2015,5,The best. You can look by month if you wish. Especially like the 'watch' feature.
2015,4,Could be made better by adding an anywhere field for departures for people who are travelling and could leave from most countries in Europe etc. Also it would be nice if there were prices for all dates when you searched for tickets in a whole month.
2015,1,"The app opens fine, but informs me that i need an internet connection to search for flights. I do in fact have connection, 4G. Shame."
2015,4,"Not able to see who operates flights on the overview like you can on the actual website. Otherwise its a brilliant, smooth and fast app"
2015,1,This app is not fair to Delta and excludes flights. I did a number of searches on known Delta routes and NO Delta flights came up. Very bias against Delta.
2015,2,"This is the first time for me to try this app , but unfortunately , the price are inaccurate , for example : I filtered the search for 3 adults and 1 child , the cheapest price was 3011 GBP each, then i changed it to one adult and the price was 2099 GBP , I was hopeful when i installed the app , i said maybe this is the perfect app for me , but i realized its not."
2015,1,App does not work i tried 3 different locations and keep getting no results. Save yourself time don't download this useless app
2015,4,Use it all the time. Love how flexible the dates and locations are. Pick a location and no date to see when it's cheapest to go. Pick a date and no location to see where is cheaper to go in a specific window.
2015,3,Not having multicity highly hinders the use of this service. Please focus on what matters the most for your users.
2015,5,Absolutely blows the competition away! Finds you deals you can't get anywhere else!
2015,1,I searched with 2 other apps and got a host of flights to choose from.  With this app there were no flights listed at all.  Glad I didn't just rely on this app.
2015,4,"Unlike other apps who ask for so much info and only give you a limited amount of info, this app is fab. It allows you to see a wide range of dates to travel. Deffo try this."
2015,5,"Loving the price alerts, would have booked at full price until I found the Skyscanner app. Registered for price alerts and same flights were just under ¬£100 cheaper for the two of us within 4 days."
2015,4,"So far so good, no extra fees, and competitive prices. Good tool for travelers"
2015,1,"Could not suck any more...promises you one rate, then transfers you to the carrier's site to try to screw you out of more money....DON'T do it!!!"
2015,5,"Use it for a long time, and mostly happy with it, but some features, i.e. hunting for few similar tickets within one request would help (like cheapest weekend tickets Moscow‚ÄîTallinn‚ÄîMoscow in 2‚Äì3 mounts, etc)."
2015,5,The search option is one of the most flexible I've seen. It has helped me a bunch when looking for flights.
2015,5,"I'm half way around the world, using only Skyscanner to reserve flights -- many the night before.  It's been perfect!"
2015,4,I like the widget that you can put on your home screen. It monitors any flights that your are thinking about going on.
2015,5,Finds flights that you can book on airlines unmentioned by Orbitz or travelocity. Works sweetly in Europe too.
2015,4,Great app. Found very inexpensive flights and hotel. I will use again and refer this to my friends and family.
2015,4,Is there any possibility that I can search for flights with multiple destinations and not just round trip?...because there are times when I need to go to another country which is different from where i came from...thanks...
2015,5,"Fast,friendly and simple. I've booked some brilliant deals with this app."
2015,2,The extreme difference between the prices shown in the graphical interface and the actual prices is very frustrating. Deceptive?
2015,1,"Every single search that I did says ""no results.""  This app is useless. I'm soo disappointed."
2015,5,And i love the everywhere anytime feature. Too bad i cant seem to pay through the app.
2015,5,Air Asia is not listed.... So as many other air lines which provides cheaper rates. Correct this mistake.
2015,5,Great app. Quick and easy. Thanks Skyscanner :-)

2015,5,Great company and a great and handy app. Makes finding deals a lot easier.
2015,5,I'm always using sky scanner. It is so amazing application. Automatically compare the most chip price flight ticket
2015,1,"After the last update the app gone too slow, sometime even not working .just blank pages..."
2015,5,"This app is the best app ever I buy all my flights from here, however it would be better if it had a Multi-destination option since while I'm in a country or continent I travel within."
2015,5,"Use this app all the time. Only place to get flights for the right place, at the right time, for the right price. OUTSTANDING APP!"
2015,5,Love this app! I can watch multiple flights at the same time. Saved me a bunch of money!
2015,5,Awesome app.. It's simple intuitive and fast. I use it all the time
2015,5,Easy to use. Booked many flights on here. Saved l9ts of money.
2015,3,"App works OK, but I have no icon in my app drawer, the only way I can open it is through the app store."
2015,5,Very good! Many flights options and show correctly the prices!
2015,5,My first time using the app found a unbelievable deal. LOVE IT!!!
2015,5,"This is hands down the best ticket compare app on the planet..  I can't find 1 thing wrong with it.  I'd give it a 9.8 ign standards, geeks out there know that's something huge"
2015,5,Great app to find cheapest flight options quickly and also very user-friendly
2015,1,Show prices (in search window) only per 1 passenger even if I buy tickets for two persons
2016,5,I used this app to travel for many times. It's useful to safe money.
2015,3,I don't understand why its so hard to give us the ability to search for multicity flights in the app. You can do it on the website.
2015,4,"I wish the links worked a bit better. Find the flights, but the links to book are always very slow.."
2015,4,ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ ŸàŸäÿ≠ÿ™ÿßÿ¨ ÿßŸÑŸä ŸÅŸÇÿ±ÿ© Ÿàÿ¨Ÿáÿßÿ™ ŸÖÿ™ÿπÿØÿØÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≠ÿ´.. It need new choise - Multi Cities
2015,2,I've been using the app for a while and recently when I go to search for a city the screen just goes black nothing comes up...
2015,5,"Very useful in comparing fares to diff destinations. Doesnt always find the cheapest flights, but is a good place to start."
2015,5,Fantastic for making spur of the moment last minute travel plans.  Being a low budget traveler it doesn't get better than this.
2015,5,Excellent app.....at one point of time you are getting all flights rate...very easy and in stance u can see entire year lowest flight...very useful...other apps are petite in front of it..10/10
2015,2,It doesn't seem to be able to add ¬£147 and ¬£147 together....it thinks it's ¬£377...and I don't want to pay that much.
2015,3,"The app name is just called flights. Trying to find it in the app list and looking for skyscanner, it's deceiving."
2015,5,"Easy to use and fast searches on the go allow me to use it at times when I'm between tasks and short on time, like on the tram or waiting for a lift."
2015,1,"Always says to Everywhere ""  will not bring up your keyboard  to allow you to type  in destination"
2015,5,Easy to use and got a great deal.  Will always use in the future
2015,4,I'm taking my girlfriend on a trip for her birthday and the flight and rental car portion saved me a lot of money.
2015,4,Really useful. The alerts are excellent for tracking the price of your desired tickets as you get close to booking.
2015,3,"Although the app is installed there's no icon in the app drawer, the only way to open it is thru installed apps on playstore..... S5 on lollipop"
2015,4,Quick fast and accurate.  Doesn't  bog you down  and shows good variety.
2015,5,Great tool for finding the cheapest flights on the cheapest days. Great app
2015,5,Easy to use.  Found some great deals.
2015,1,"Uninstalled,it keeps on saying no available flights the directed with delta ads.no flights to asia,really?"
2015,4,"The only drawback is sometimes the flights are slightly higher when purchasing. Still, its my go to app when traveling."
2015,5,"I love it, because it let's you fly high in the friendly skies, for the cheapest price ever. Keep up the good work."
2015,5,Got me the best price. So it works lol
2015,4,"Excellent app, performs as described.  It is now my goto travel app!"
2015,1,What's the point of using a platform that uses fraudulent providers? Do your homework Skyscanner!
2015,5,"Cheapest tickets,  efficient,  i just wish you can do like a multi trip on there but its worth downloading."
2015,5,Brilliant app!! got flights to America and back for really cheep!! :)
2015,1,Used to be good but now totally wrong information and can't search direct flight
2015,4,I have checked it with other similar websites. I can say it offers better flights and better prices.
2015,4,Very good app! But sometimes the prices are not right
2015,3,It would be much helpful if I can choose which airlines to include in price alert and multiple airlines filter.
2015,1,Shows no results while expedia app and kayak app show numerous for same search criteria.
2015,5,There really is no question. It picks up all airlines - even the low-cost ones too. Anything else is just biased.
2015,4,"Easy to use, intuitive and doesn't seem to exclude airlines like other similar apps."
2015,3,...but the prices on the alert widget seem to change when you click them to open the app.
2015,4,Clean lay out. It's really an awesome app!
2015,4,Seems to do what it supposed to. Proof will be when we book our flights and the price is what it says.
2015,5,"Really quick and easy to use, love the price alerts too, really helpful. I haven't experienced any problems with this."
2015,3,"I mean omg roundtrip to Haiti @ $300, omg omg. Love this app"
2015,5,I have used this app many time over the past year and it has saved me the best part of ¬£1000 on the flights I have booked.
2015,5,Usex this app and haven't had any trouble.  More travel  to come very handy.
2015,3,I used to use the widget all of the time and am disappointed to find that it is no longer available.
2015,3,The app is great but sometimes get spammed from bravo fly it usually doubles while booking
2015,4,I think they can improve more. ..but still for me the best app about travels...that's why 4...
2015,4,Easy way of obtaining all required travel information as well as making checking in very easy.
2015,4,"It still has a few things to improve but I dont complain, useful, easy friendly..."
2015,4,Great app - multi segment search option would be still a quantum leap!
2015,5,Gave me the best pricing and saved me some money! App is easy to use.
2015,1,I tried to book the flight so many times and never allow me
2015,4,Easy to use. Gives a good guide to price's and airlines.
2015,5,"Good way to quickly compare prices, and save money on airline fees. Would recommend to friends and family in a heartbeat."
2015,5,So helpful for finding the cheapest way to travel! Love the monthly graph charts.
2015,4,you guys need to add more Pakistani airlines i.e shaheen and air indus in ur search engine
2015,5,I haven't yet found something for which I'd have to go to the website (full desktop) to find out. Keep up the good work.
2015,4,"I would like to avoid stops in Kiev,  and currently there is no option on the app to choose that"
2015,5,"Very simple and easy to use, I can't remember a time I was able to find cheap flights using a different service"
2015,3,I haven't getting the tickets yet but it's a starting point
2015,5,Love this app! Every time I get a travel bug I look up the best flights.
2015,2,Does not allow me to choose destination make it user friendly please
2015,4,"Bugs out quite a bit, but as a whole a good app."
2015,5,I have used this app many times for flying and it's great. Keep up the good work
2015,1,Only brings up us airways  when other airline go to the destination
2015,3,Prices listed in skyscanner app. are different than prices listed in the airline website
2015,5,"I'm using it for more than 3 years, i'm totally happy with this apps. Keep up the good work guys"
2015,4,Is so easy to find flights and times all in one place.
2015,4,If it shows the price for the whole month will br even better !
2015,5,Best place to find cheap flights. Let's you book directly with the Airlines.
2015,3,Pls notice the price change immediately if it is in my watching date
2015,5,Really good app! Prices need updating and multi trip will be really useful though
2015,1,Apparently there are no flights from Chicago to Las Vegas on 7/27
2015,5,It helps me be able to not have to focus so much on finding flights because it's constantly looking for me on various sites.
2015,5,Easy to use. Love the fact you can put in everywhere as your search which shows the cheapest countries to fly to.
2015,5,Absolutely live this app. So easy to use and constantly up to date.

2015,5,"Good app, good flight overview, good functionality. I check out out mandatory before I book any flights."
2015,5,"I love this app, it can even show the internal or local flight schedule in my country, Hussle freeee,well done folks."
2015,3,"OK for r/t or one way, but what about open jaws or multi-stop flights?"
2015,5,It's like a new toy.I discover every day new destinations at affordable prices in places  I wouldn't even dreamed.
2015,4,Should include an additional option for multi-destinations.
2015,4,Id give it 5 if it could buy my ticket too
2015,4,Great app easy to use and helpful and easy menu for finding the right flight
2016,2,nothing every one of the other travel sites would not provide better
2015,4,"Good, but does not cover all airlines"
2015,5,Really enjoy using this app and the bar graph option to view days before and after a chosen date range is very useful.
2016,3,When you want to book for an adult n infant it is showing the same rate as adults for infant ticket too...
2015,3,Great app but seem  a bit biased towards delta
2015,5,"Great app to scan all the available flights , with good prices . I refer this every time :)"
2015,5,awesome app to review on multiple airlines prices. it also helps to mix and match cheap flight tickets.
2015,5,This totally changed the way I plan vacations. It even searches southwest!

2018,1,"The website is far better, the app is complicated and annoying."
2015,5,Awesome app works great finds the absolute lowest fares that other apps can't or don't want to show
2015,5,This is a must have for everyone! Having an app that checks so many flights is such a time and money saver
2015,5,Such a great app needs easy sharing. Can you make this possible?
2015,5,"Lemec  I love it, very friendly application easy to use, the best ever."
2015,5,"Really good, app works perfectly, readers your last airports typed."
2015,5,"Great app, to see prices have not bought tickets yet."

2015,1,Prices are way higher on here than the actual websites.
2015,5,"Long time user of Skyscanner and I'm  very happy with it. However, I am very surprised to see the negative feedback."
2015,5,"So easy to use,everything you need to start your holiday booking."

2015,4,Bills to multiple entities but found lowest price.
2015,5,Whenever I search for flights Skyscanner invariably offers very good prices and a range of flight times for European destinations.

2015,1,"Nothing but headaches. I have used it twice to make reservations. First time, I had to re-book with the airline, since the reservation hadn't actually been made, and the confirmation number I had wasn't recognizable by the airline's system.  Second time, I was trying to make reservations for two people, leaving on different flights and returning on the same flight. Very difficult to even do this, then even worse to get the payment through their system. Received an email indicating that the flight had not been booked, so called their support number, and was told the flight had been booked, even though the credit card authorization they said was necessary never had been given. After about three and a half hours on the phone, reservations were made. Have now renamed this app Skyscammer,  and removed it. Never again."
2015,2,"Constantly running in the background. Even after forced stop. Draining battery and probably sending data! I only used this app once, but my power saver app has to shut this down EVERY time i run the power saver - which i run several times every day. Sick of it! UNINSTALLING!!"
2015,1,Been using skyscanner for a long time but when I have a new phone and installed it again i can not use it. It says that there is no connection although I've checked my connection several times. I've also changed the location and the currency but it didnt work. Please fix it.
2015,5,"Clean and brilliant UI, fast and lightweight, and ads free! The most valuable app I ever seen. And even has Vietnamese language. I recommend this app for every traveling lover out there. There is only one thing that I believe would make this app more great. That it let we choose threshold of depart and return day for cheap flights if you guys understand me."
2015,4,"I love how flexible this tool is. Yes, you have to take the results as a guide, but it gives a great idea if you're looking for a cheap flight. More frequent updating of prices, plus a rough indication of extras (mainly hold baggage) would give it 5 stars."
2015,3,"Tried checking flights from Adelaide Australia to Bangkok. No direct flights exist so this is a test of trip duration (pass) and whether you can select the stopover airport (fail). Multiple airlines are allowed, but you cannot select which ones (fail). Flying Qantas from Adelaide to Melbourne, then Thai Air to Bangkok, is an option that doesn't exist..."
2015,3,"This app was amazing before they started forcing you to use third party companies (that charge additional fees) to purchase tickets. I used to use Skyscanner to find and purchase airline tickets all the time; but, after I was duped into paying some company $50 more for a ticket than it was worth, I began using it as a baseline only. I search for tickets using Skyscanner then purchase my tickets directly from the airline. Lesson learned!"
2015,2,"Calendar view price is consistently less than actual price. By considerable amounts (difference &gt;$50 and at times &gt;$100). Have not found a single accurate price, with multiple airports. Waste of time?"
2015,5,"I have been using this app for over a year now and must say it does exactly what I want and fairly easy to navigate. I don't use the purchase option so I can't rate or comment on that section of the app, I simply use it to narrow my dates and airline down and then purchase from a website that I use regularly. And the price always matches that of the website I use. 5 stars from me."
2015,2,"When I search KUL &gt; BKK, in the app, you purposely don't show the budget airlines. But the budget airlines are available in the desktop version. I checked all necessary settings but to no avail"
2015,3,Hi I have a problem with the chart..I tried the search for a whole month. For most of the searches I do I see only one or two price options. Sometimes I don't see any price options. What can I do to fix this?? Thanks
2015,4,"Hey Skyscanner, I want to ask if you guys can search more airline providers, like United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, or Hawaiian Airlines? Please add these awesome airlines for us to get THE BEST DEAL!!! üòÄ‚úà‚úà"
2015,4,Great Meta search app. figures out all possible cheapest flight options. Worth spending time to dig out best deals..
2015,5,"The single best feature is that you can select dates for when you want to fly and the destination can be set to ""Everywhere"". Instead of looking for the lowest rates by city, you can then scroll the results by the lowest price to hundreds of cities in the world. Try it once and you'll be hooked."
2015,5,One of the few tools that don't require a fare search by dates. Sometimes travelers can go anytime. They just need to know the cheapest option.
2015,4,"Needs an easier more flexible interface, but very good. Some low cost airlines in the middle east do not appear in search results."
2017,1,Crap.  No option to choose return flights other than the near future. Or explore feature. Better on ios.  Forget about this app better to use the website.
2015,2,The calendar prices aren't even close to the details when I pull up the available flights on certain days. Completely useless if that's going to be the case
2015,4,Love that I can search anywhere and just check out the prices and watch certain flight prices. Cleaner UI and some more search options would make it a 5 easily.
2015,4,"Very easy to use, never had any crashes and it can give some very nice prices. Sometimes it's still better to check individual airline pricing via thier websitr though before actually booking."
2016,1,teruk..update ptt makin memudahkan..tp ini sangat teruk dan menyukarkan..not friendly user...mohon kembali pada paparan lama..
2015,5,I prefer the mobile app over the desktop version! The multi screen view is great for trying to find the best price over multiple airports or dates!
2015,1,"Every flight I put in would come back with ""no results"", really? No flights from TUS to BOS next month, I don't think so...it didn't matter the flights always ""no results"""
2015,3,"Even if selecting direct flights only, the results say, ""hidden,"" forcing to remove filters.  That means one has to scroll which is not ideal on mobile device"
2015,4,Great app. But I would like to see a smarter search engine (eg. departure date +- 3 days etc.)
2015,5,This app is just what I need as a frequent traveler. I tried many of my destinations and it gives very accurate info. It will save me hours of planning. Thumbs up.
2015,4,I've been searching other websites and I feel like I've found cheaper flights on those search engines. I do like how it'll keep watching a flight for me
2015,1,"Just downloaded app, carried out a search and I'm told I'm using an old version update to the latest..... I've just downloaded it"
2015,5,This is better than any website out there.  Free and very easy to use!  I can't wait to see the world!
2015,5,"Made searching for hotels, flights sooooo much easier. Fast and easy. 5 stars from me."
2015,5,That's about it. The best. No interest. Ads are not naggy. Scans relatively fast and real-time.
2015,4,I think that the prices on the search should be more accurate. very often you select dates and when you hit search airlines it is almost aways more expensive...
2015,5,"I already booked 6 flight's thru this app, it was always the best price! I searched all other websites and skyscanner was always the best! Love it!!!"
2015,4,Muy buena app y rapidisima..la recomiendo y es amigable..consegu√≠ buenos precios a veces mejor que en la misma aerolinea..aunq puede mejorar le falta la opci√≥n de m√∫lti-city y a veces  los precios cambian dicen uno ahora y al segundo cambia..pero definitivamente mejor q cualquier otra app
2015,1,"I book through this app, I found out that it's more expensive than the other sited...really disappointed with this app."
2015,5,I don't travel without using this app now.  It's ridiculously useful.  Keep up the great work.
2015,5,This app is great for searching flights wit results from various airlines.  I found flights sometimes cheaper on here then on the airlines website. Recommended
2015,3,"Well, I do like this app though did not see much price gaps for india market."
2015,5,Great app. Helps find the best deals.
2015,5,It allows me to use multiple search windows and checks all the airline sites as well as other sites for the best price. Love the price alert emails.
2015,2,"What happened to the widget? When I always see No Internet Connection, I tried to reinstall the app and after that, I no longer can find the widget."
2015,2,"just another flight app, not best prices, not best options, no alternate suggestions."
2015,4,"it would be much better, if it allows to search multiple cities & open jaw ticket as well."
2015,4,Skyscanner search gives cheap search but they have to exclude some companies that shows fake cheap price as bait
2015,5,Before using this application I had spent a lot of extra money on my flight bookings. This application helps you find the right price for you.
2015,4,"It's a very good app., and gives iteration for most of the airlines ., yet it has to update interior European routes."
2015,4,Would rate 5 stars if there was a +/- 1 or 2 days option.
2015,1,UN effective .. only one flight the other flights is hidden
2015,5,Its been so easy to book a flight since i use skyscanner... great apps
2015,5,Not only find a cheapest ticket but provide all other alternatives. Especially bar chart helps the most which i think brilliant idea.
2015,4,I love it at first time i installed it till now...keep improving
2015,4,I would have given 5 stars if it showed the option for multi- destinations
2015,1,Tried to search my flights but it's doesn't show at all
2015,5,Lot of options and nice design of the app. Would love it if multi stop options are available
2015,5,"It compares to all the options u can have, agents, airline's, better than last minute, Expedia and the own airline, great website"
2015,5,"Very good,  I find all local flights and also cheap long distance flights. Ty"
2015,5,Does what it is supposed to. Finds flights quickly and transfers you to the appropriate site seamlessly.
2015,1,Multiple searches for pretty standard routes with no results each time.
2015,5,"Super app.. does exactly what you want, what more could you ask for."
2015,5,"I travel a lot, and this app has saved me so much time and money.  I highly recommend it."
2015,5,I have found it one of the best ways to find a cheapest price for a flight.. High recommendation
2015,5,Excellent easy-to-use price alerts. Everything you need
2015,4,It will be perfect if can search for hotel in app.
2015,4,"Good app, with reasonable prices and deals."
2015,5,"I'm an avid flight price hunter,  and this is the best app I've found yet."
2015,4,"Basata su volagratis, utilissima per i viaggi con date flessibili, un po' scomoda per itinerari round trip"
2015,5,You can check out flights from anywhere in UK to anywhere in the world to grab a bargain. Clear and easy to use.
2015,5,"If you ever need to look anywhere else for your flights, you're using the app wrong ;)"
2015,3,"Good, but no multi destination :-("
2015,5,If you have been searching the best prices for travel and intend to receive  alerts about opportunities. This is the app
2015,5,Its a nice app but i would love to have more companies there since i have noticed that the low fare companies are not there.
2015,5,Very easy way to find the best fares and to track them for a later purchase.
2015,5,Definitely the best and lightest (on memory) travel app on android
2015,4,Good app. Will always use it
2015,5,One thing I'd like to see is have the ability to search via Frequent Flyer program
2015,5,I love this app. Has saved me plenty!!
2015,4,Great quick way of browsing for cheap flights
2015,5,I downloaded so many software for flight tickets booking but this one was best ever I seen ...thanks for who made this software
2015,3,The daily prices on the chart are nowhere near the prices in the search.
2015,5,"Best travelling app, excellent for multiple connections."
2015,5,Really useful. I use it as a reference for all the flights I book.
2015,5,"Accurate,  you got the flight you want in seconds."
2015,5,Checks all air lines also possible dates.
2015,5,I love this app! It's well designed.
2016,5,Very briefly the best flight search app ever
2015,5,Use it all the time.  It's great!!
2015,5,If you ever tried to find the cheapest ticket no matter what the destination is - this is the app for you
2015,5,Really great way to check fight prices quickly
2015,3,I would rate 5 if you add my local currency
2015,5,Great app! Whereever you are flying to make sure you check this app out
2015,5,Very fast to look up something.
2015,4,Vale a pena baixar... Para viagens internacionais √© o melhor...

2015,5,"So smart and stable, love it."
2015,5,I hope there would be a feature that allows us to sort/filter based on aircraft type and layover time.
2015,5,Gives a new meaning to User friendliness !
2015,5,"Anyone planning a trip, needs this app"
2015,4,They need to work for multi trips
2015,4,plz add flight details wen u show details of trip.
2015,5,So easy and quick to use
2015,4,Hand little app.
2015,5,"An update we can all use, get notified via Google now cards when the price of your flight drops!"
2015,5,Just perfect!

2015,5,thanks skyscanner
2015,5,Airline flights and pricing
2015,5,Number one
2015,5,
2015,2,"Comparing prices on here is good because it shows potential to be cheaper. Although, expect to pay little more when booking the actual flight(s)... The problem I had was the Chrome browser on my S5 warned me about safety concerns. I ignored it initially and tried to continue booking from the ""Travel2Be"" website. There was no website found. I searched for the website on my desktop; nothing. Really sketch when it comes to booking."
2017,2,"I originally gave skyscanner 5 stars, because you could search 'anywhere' for inspiration, and you could then scroll through an entire years worth of dates in a graph style to find the absolute perfect flight. Now you have to pick a specific country, and specific dates for your initial search which you can then expand to no more than a month - and the visual graph style pricing is no longer there. I have no idea why they would downgrade so horrifically. Deleted this app within minutes. So disappointed."
2015,4,"Simple interface, good range of results usually, even though some can be absurdly expensive and indirect routings the further down the list of options you go -- but hey, they're options! Seems to offer the best range for European flights in the apps/sites I've tried so far."
2015,3,"Similar issue as other reviews: shows one price on the search list and then a much higher price in the book screen.  The problem is with flights that have multiple segments operated by different  airlines.  You guys need to ADD.   Please do not use a caned reply to contact you - your app - you can contact me.  Otherwise,  cleanly done and is very useful."
2015,3,"The app is ok to have an idea of how much a flight is but The web versi√≥n is superior in every way. It is even faster using the mobile browser than the app sometimes. The app has a lot of potential, but it is nor yet fullt realized"
2015,1,"The everywhere option is not working after the last update. It just shows a list of countries, and I have to click each to find prices. The same goes to the month option, I have to click on every day to find prices and I no longer have access to the comparison."
2015,1,"Everywhere I search, nothing but US Airways flight options out of RDU. Did  a quick check online to compare same search dates and destinations, always finding cheaper flights with other major airlines. Would be nice to see this app when it is up to par with web searching."
2015,4,"Great app, used it to book flights to London and Madrid. Great resource. I did Google search the sites it told me to use to book the cheap flights and used that to make my decision. It better to book via an actual airline/ generally well know website and not any of these new unheard of 3rd party websites."
2015,3,"Great and intuitive usability however, After updating the app when I try to search for flights I get the message that my version is out of date even though I have the latest version. This prevents me from getting my results. Navigates me back to the search page."
2015,2,"Trying to show return flights. Clicking return defaults destination to another one. Cleared cache and searches, same problem. Can't use the app anymore because every return search defaults to KH-Cambodia. No idea what's going on."
2015,5,"Been using Skyscanner for a while now, great handy app. Clean UI with really easy navigation and filtering system. The only app you need really to plan your holiday flights!"
2015,2,"Searching flights to Tokyo. The app shows you one price but when you click on it you get a totally different price. I've seen a lot of people complain about this for a long time,  it wasn't always like this please fix it."
2015,2,New update only shows flights from Southwest only. Before showed all major airlines not sure what happen but shopping for a different app now.
2015,5,"Fantastic information on the most inexpensive flights quickly on one site. No need to go through individual sites.  Easier to use than Priceline, Expedia,  etc.  Haven't booked a flight yet but plan to at some point"
2015,5,Thanks to skysanner for finding the lowest flight ever! I was hopeless the past coupla days! Thank goodness for this app! 100 more stars to skyscanner!
2015,1,"Always show ""You are using an old version of the app. Please update to the latest version."" Uninstall then install but still show the popup again."
2015,4,I have extensively used this app always give good results. Best feature it will give you price every 24 hrs .
2015,1,Bait and switch. A total waste of time. ON THE FLY. App is reliable and current.  Doesn't give you prices then you can't book them at that price
2015,1,For how many millions of flights in a day it shows no results. It sucks my day. Thank you
2015,5,Easy to use app and great navigation through the different opinions. I've been using the site for years and will now use the app as long as it doesn't start to get buggy.
2015,4,Let's see how the app runs after the update. Will re-rate later.
2015,2,"Why are the flights/prices I choose never available when I go through to the next page? One way flight is dearer than the return I selected in the planner,,,, ALWAYS, fix it!!!!!!"
2015,4,"It is a very useful tool, however, it laks the possibility of multiple stops search and quite often price are not shown on a flexible date mode."
2015,2,Gives good prices then tells you that ticket is not available and jumps the cost up handsomely.
2015,4,Useful that can have multiple tabs. Cheap prices and easy bookings
2015,5,Booked most of my flights for the last year on here no major issues. Don't know how I managed without it!
2015,3,"When direct us to the website error or on the website itself , last part of key - in the credit card part got error too"
2015,1,Orbits gave me cheaper tickets 100 bucks less. Going from New York to Seattle and from Seattle to new York the ticket on orbit was 360 and here 468.
2015,5,Great app to search flights. From planned to spontaneous trips this app will get you there!!
2015,5,"Pretty much the website consolidated for mobile, with little messing around. Must have."
2015,4,Really great app i love it.it must be updated.

2015,4,easy to find great prices for your travel..
2015,4,"If this apps can be used for multi cities flight booking, then it will be a5 stars from me"
2015,5,The best all round flight search tool I've ever found.
2015,5,Very useful when i have to look for a few airlines for my vacation flight

2015,1,"this app is pointless. thought it was nice that i was able to scan through the days and pick the cheapest one, but when you initially go through with that ''deal'' you think you're getting, the price of the flight comes out to be $50+ MORE than what was said. overall, takes more work than any other ole app.  will not be using one that gets my hopes up by lying."
2015,5,"**UPDATE - Glitches happen, but never have I had such an immediate response to a problem. I hope they have this weird issue fixed with a later update.  For now, I will search on any day but the first.  Thanks for a wonderful tool that I use daily, and thanks for the honest and prompt customer service.  5 star app in my book.  Kind of a must have for a world traveller.         -- The problem:  This used to work fine, now the update constantly says the time zone is bad.  Please fix this as I used it all the time."
2015,5,"I  fly 2 to 3 times a year and, I love this app. Sometimes there are exclusive mobile phone discounts. I have checked over and over again for better online deals and there are none, it's either the same our the app is better. It's convenient, easy, reliable, and complete. I don't use anything else anymore, I recommend it all the time."
2015,1,"I had been eyeing flights on the sky scanner app and when I finally chose one from Buenos Aires Argentina to Miami Florida, I was connected with sky-tours. I put my card information in on this app and received an email from sky-tours, saying that they needed a confirmation code from my bank. I called my bank and the bank said they didn't know anything about a confirmation code, then I was sent an email asking me to send a picture of my credit card front and back and my government issued ID front and back."
2015,4,Shows tickets that arent actually available a lot of the time. Would REALLY be better with a feature that let's you save that perfect flight you've seen. Just in case it's still there when you come to book
2015,3,"I use this app strictly for looking up which airline flies where and when. I was disappointed when I found out that a lot of airlines are not included. Two of which I fly alot, Delta and Southwest. Why aren't their flights listed on this app???"
2015,5,"It's a fantastic app. Just a suggestion, if you could have an option for the user to choose how he wants the flights to be displayed for return journeys instead of displaying options as a preset price wise."
2015,2,"Booked one flight through the app before i realized prices were listed in usd. My ip is Australia... cool design of app, poor experience."
2015,3,"What a pity,  the application has good filters,  and you can keep favorites search.  But unfortunately the results of search are false,  and when you are redirected to the website of the seller,  prices and durations of travel are totally different (longer and more expensives)."
2015,4,A beatiful tool. But why at the end I saw a price of 41‚Ç¨ in the list become 52 opening the item and after I ended at 70‚Ç¨.
2015,5,Easy to use and after looking at other sites seems to come up with the lowest prices. I like the feature where you can see which is the cheapest day to travel.
2015,1,I used to rate this app but lately the prices displayed are false everytime i get directed to the site the price displayed changes by about ¬£1000. Think i will use alternative site such as kayak or google flight search.
2015,4,"I will update review as used. So far ease use 5 stars, accuracy of prices 4 stars."
2015,5,Been using the website for years now even handier with the app. Best flight price comparison tool out there.
2015,3,Failure to search either by airport or country after updating the the latest version. Hope it can be fixed asap~
2015,5,Very user friendly. Payment options also made very easy. Trustworthy app.
2015,1,"I enter my details and receive prices for selection given yet when i am re-directed to the airline site the prices are ‚Ç¨60 to ‚Ç¨70 dearer, this site is a ""JOKE""."
2016,5,Great app. Whenever I am planning a trip for myself or the family I use it to make sure we got the best deal or the best connection.
2015,2,"No multi city option, charts don't display, found cheaper flights on Google. Fail."
2015,3,Seems nice but I didn't booked before thru it because I'm still not sure about the level of it's security  Also it doesn't give the option for multiple distances.
2015,5,Never let me down. Prices may differ sometimes but always to my advantage. Cheaper!! Only need to know how to book multiple flights.

2015,5,I found this app most convenient and efficient in getting the most accurate information on flight data.  Thank you so much.
2015,4,"Very helpful app but has some bugs though : prices are not always shown in the diagram; doesn't show actual direct flights when searching from city X to everywhere with ""direct flights only"""
2015,2,The destination search screen goes blank when I type the place I want to go to. Its rendered the app useless. PLS look in.
2015,2,"Ive been using skyscanner for the past 2 years, but recent update made it worse,when we search  for a destination the screen blacks out and not responding"
2015,5,"I tried a few competitors and found no one that showed as many results. If there is a low cost flight, it's shown here!"
2015,4,"I haven't booked a flight yet,  but the app looks solid, I'll give them a 5 if i find it worthy after i book a flight"
2015,5,Easy navigation. Enable user to search quickly. Reliable.
2015,4,When is your new version launching ...because my phone present version does not support your application
2015,2,Good but need to be easy for payment use credit card.. I'd tried pay for many times and failed always..
2015,5,"I have been using this site for sometime now and booked last year's holiday,  but when I check on it from the beginning of the year I have noticed easy jet and ryanair don't come up, is there a reason for this if so what a shame but other wise great app"
2015,5,Easy navigation. Nice ui. Thumbs up!
2015,5,This is the first airline app I have found that gives accurate airline info. It's so easy to use. I love it!
2015,5,Easy to set up and use.  Quick search and results. Remember it's up to you to check and follow through the results carefuuly
2015,1,"Yep, quoted $16,000 for return business class - about $5-$6k everywhere else on the net. Something is amiss methinks"
2015,5,The one stop app for searching the best deals for travel I always use it before travel thank u skyscanner
2015,5,"Does exactly what I need it to, when I need it. Very happy, thanks!"
2015,5,Brings all flight searches to 1 screen.. can add alerts for price changes etc. quite useful when planning a trip.
2015,1,Did a search from FLL to PHL for August and no flights were found? This app is useless.
2015,2,This program doesn't work for me anymore. Won't find any locations when I do a search
2015,5,I use it all the time when looking for flights and it never disappoints. Thank you
2015,4,I think it's ok for an app.  I wish there was more search criteria to narrow results but good functionality for an app.
2015,3,"Very handy but noticed it no longer includes some airlines, e.g. Cebu Pacific Air."
2015,5,The app is really user friendly and very clear! I love it
2015,5,Great app and awesome service! Thank you!
2015,4,Great for finding the airline that has the best fare. But I go to that site after I've found the cheapest.
2015,2,Close in flights to ANY destination are always wrong when you click through to airline to book.
2015,5,Great app for flights. Haven't used it for anything else
2015,5,Really like the ability to search for regional uk airports. Also like the views that show prices for the days around your chosen dates of travel.
2015,5,Wish to have multiple destination inquiry in future update. Thanks
2015,5,It's so easy to use! Thanks!
2015,5,So easy to use and it has very flexible search parameters. Top drawer.
2015,5,I have used this app numerous time and have booked flights through it without any issues. Way better than any other travel app.
2015,4,It would be very helping if we could directly book the flight without go to the website
2015,4,Most impressive so far & perfect for us lower income consumers.
2015,5,Really easy to use and I haven't found cheaper flights anywhere else! :D üëç

2015,3,"Good,  at least to check the fares  in a single window"
2015,4,Great help since we are planning a trip in 2 months.
2015,5,Is perfect for those times when you can afford to be flexible with flights and it's also so quick to compare different days/times/airlines
2015,5,I depend on it for all my travel. Thanks
2015,3,"Cannot get price alerts on the app, that is a pitty"
2015,4,Gives you idea to compare with what your travel agent is asking for.
2015,5,"The best the easiest, the most convenient to visually look at n understand, AND purchase with. Used multiple times."
2015,4,Found the best deals compared to Hotwire and Priceline.
2016,2,Dissapointent - does not work for ryanair flights.
2015,5,"I'm loving this skyscanner, better than all the rest."

2016,5,Oooddii bhai saahab...shi main...great....best app for search flights from anywhere to everywhere.

2015,5,The best app that I found so far to get the cheapest flight from A to B. And pretty simple to use
2015,5,I never thought I would find cheap flights but thanks to this app I have and I love it.
2015,5,"Status bar is not colour coded but otherwise, perfection."
2015,5,My 'go to' app as can compare flight prices day by day then see immediately the multitude of configurations of flights and prices
2015,5,This app is easy to use and is spectacular in finding the best one way prices.
2015,5,"Tried all others, skycanner s the best."
2015,5,If you are searching for cheap fares this is the only one to use!

2015,5,Wow
2015,5,WOW
2015,5,Ok
2015,5,ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤
2015,5,No 1
2015,5,For a older version
2015,4,I read a previous review that hinted at a similar issue. The calendar graph layout is amazing! However on the main search page you can only filter for Direct or Non-Direct flights. The filters for other things including # of stops is on a separate filter page. I want to view the calendar graph layout by 1 stop flights. Please put on the main search page the direct option (already exists) + 1 stop option (not there). The app is currently not nearly as useful for finding cheap 1 stop flights. Thanks!!!
2015,3,"I'm not sure how people who rated this app 4-5 stars use it,  but it's not the same way I do.   The user interface and simple search is great,  but whenever I search for the entire month or multiple dates,  the advertised prices ALWAYS change when I click on a specific date.   Please fix."
2015,1,"Doesn't show prices on phone, only shows a few prices on tablet. Both running same android. Better if price watch was for any day cheapest price instead of set DAT."
2015,2,"Searched for a flight from Sydney to Perth, the app shows me the price was $407.25, but when I clicked book and it took me to the actual airline website, the price has gone up to $518. Very disappointed about it. Also, the prices are way  different when I search through the app and your website. One last thing, how can Edream still one of the provider on your app??? They are a dishonest company."
2015,4,Works well for most! I think I may get a discount through southwest airlines though because I always find a better deal on southwest then I do from this app. I love how it has links to all of the airlines bag fees. Good job!
2016,2,"Used to be useful and easy, now it's just a frustrating mess. Does find some flights though but the new UX should never have made it past beta..."
2015,4,"""Would you like to rate us on Android Market."" Seriously? I think it's called Play Store since 3 years now. Otherwise good app"
2015,5,"I experienced a problem with this app and my Nexus 5 previously, but apparently the latest version fixed the issue (I was on dalvik all the time). Thanks!"
2015,2,"App used to work great.  Now when I search all I see is United,  Southwest and a few others. I'm going from Atlanta to Dulles and they don't even list all the Delta flights!!!  Please fix your app."
2015,1,"Could not get it to work. Very frustrating because it would never display flights unless I cleared all filters, which defeated the prose of the app.   Waste of time"
2015,4,"Overall, great app with great search and filter capabilities. Only downside was that the prices didn't match the site it pushed me to for final booking. Far better than any airline's search."
2015,4,Have used the web n app versions. This is the best service for travel planning. Even beats google flights in some cases.
2015,5,"3/16/15 -- Woke up to find a response to my review in less than 12 hours.  Uninstalling and reinstalling the app fixed the problem.   Great customer service!  App is very easy to use.  5 stars!  3/15/15 --Every time I try a search, it says my time and date are out of sync and to change my settings to use automatic time/date.  Problem is, I'm already using that.  Quite frustrating."
2015,1,"Crashed every time I pulled up the calendar. Also, doesn't seem to be an option for multi city stops"
2015,5,"Works effectively and efficiently, I really like the whole concept and the app design has a logical and simple layout and process. Well done!"
2015,5,"I love this app. Unlike airline apps it is really quick and totally hassle free to perform multiple searches. I love the month to view facility, it's very well laid out."
2015,2,I'm unable to search for multicities! Please update and add the option as it would appear on the desktop version.
2015,5,Usefull tool. Limited reliability is to be expected for good reason. Strongly recomended for refference and even for ticket resevetions.
2015,5,It works perfectly fine on Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Love it. Highly recommend.
2017,4,Great app for finding flight options and best prices. I travel a lot and use it all the time to plan my trips.
2015,4,This is a great app for checking flights would have given it 5 stars but seems to have frozen on me in the chart. Screen won't let me return to search .
2015,5,"Very useful, user friendly app. Haven't bought flights through it, just checked availability."
2015,5,"Love the smooth functionality of this app. Makes arranging value holidays, comparing destination and costs, easy. Uninstall after use to avoid spam."
2015,5,I use this app and this one only after time and time again finding it the best in finding the lowest price flights for my business travel. I use no other. It is the best when stuck in an airport with cancer flights.
2015,5,Fast and accurate! Wish it had a search 3+/- days option though.
2015,4,After a new search it always asks me to refresh th page if I click on a flight even though I've just searched for it other than brilliant
2015,5,"Really great flights search engine and the app implements all its advantages! The ability to put ""any"" in almost any parameter helps to find the optimal choice (like move the trip by several days to save money or even choose the trip destination based on price offers)"
2015,5,Easy and user friendly. Rates are not cheapest all the time but it had good search results
2015,5,"Having tried out quite a few booking apps, this is the best. The prices you see are almost the exact prices you end up paying so it's totally reliable."
2015,4,Its really easy to use. The filter also complete. Add more LCC airline will this apps greater!
2015,5,I find this is one of the easiest to use to search by price.  Watch out that you contact the airline  right away to secure a good seat and you get the airline's confirmation code.
2015,5,"It is a very good app. Still, multi city search option would be a very good option to improve it."
2015,4,Works well. Why trawl through multiple sites when Skyscanner does it all with no drama.
2015,5,Useful and nicely produced information for at glance info it is great.                          Thank you Devs üòä
2015,1,while I am using the app. Also widget does not show business class prices
2015,5,I love this app. Works great and you get the lowest prices available on flights.
2015,4,It works exactly the way it says it does. I'm very happy with it.
2015,5,The best application program across all platforms I know of for getting an overall view of current flight prices. Invaluable to cut through the walls of intended barriers to best flight prices.
2015,4,Easy to check and book. One tool for all your trips.
2015,5,vert good app. user friendly ui design.
2015,4,"I experienced some very frustrating app issues at first, but now it is working fine. Good app so far."
2015,2,Prices are way off then what it shows..Picked a prices that says 550 and get sent over to Fare depot and prices shoots up to almost 800
2015,5,High-five interface. Top user experience.
2015,1,I asked my travel agent about traveling ticket from sernek to istanbul and it was 70$ but in your program it is 245$!!!
2015,3,Complicated by sorting and by moving between the lists. By changing the date or the airport you have to go back to the main list.
2015,5,It's great but two improvements I'd like to see in the next release are a) smaller size widget and b) filters  saved with watched searches
2015,4,Go to app for finding flights!! Headline prices don't match prices you end up paying though.
2015,5,"Very good, I used this app and I found the cheapest flight, I checked many sites but this one gave me the cheapest price . Thanks skyscanner."
2015,4,Found the flight's I wanted and at a great price. Will use more often for national & international flights from now on.
2015,5,The best way to travel. Works for me every time.

2019,1,"When booking YVR to MCO for February flights for 2020 it shows you cheapest 15 airfares. When you go to book the $339Cdn return airfare,skyscanner takes you to airlines website . then tells you a price adjustment error and so u accept the new higher price and brings you back to the lower price that u initially wanted. But it never allows you to purchase your tickets AMERICAN & United have looked into it and said its the Skyscanner app. So ive decided to go to the Hopper & Agoda app."
2015,2,Need to include more service providers like Ibibo. Descrepancy noticed in prices in charts and when actually see that listing. Watched category does jot refresh at all automatically. Will update my comments by good to average.. There is no refresh button.  Plus.. When we see listing prices are different what we see inside any particular selection.
2015,4,This app is amazing but make sure all your booking info is absolutley correct before you finalize especially if you are traveling internationally. I read the calendar incorrect and put the wrong month in for my departure date for two different flights. After realizing it shortly after I had no choice but to make a change or be charged full price if I canceled. I was hit with 200 dollars in fees!! The cheaper the airlines the more crooked their policies. Be careful!
2015,1,"I gave this app a great rating a week ago, but trying to book a flight during the past week has changed my view completely!  My ""slight moan"" that the headline price is not available when you go to specific airport details is now a huge disatisfier - in my experience, the headline price is rarely, if ever available!  I also experienced many occasions when, despite completing all the search criteria, I was presented with flights that were not available, or with an insufficient number of tickets available to match my needs (problems in this regard with Delta Airlines especially). Found Gotogate much more reliable after being directed there by Skyscanner,  so will use that in future."
2015,5,"I rarely rate apps, but feel the need to thank the creators of this one. My wife and I are headed to Costa Rica, and for weeks had used the app to track prices. We had settled on paying between 1350 and 1500 for both of us. Woke up last Saturday, checked the app, and an unbelievable $977 popped up! I booked it right away, and can now afford a camera to take down with us. Thanks so much!"
2015,1,before you are able to see more detailed flight prices because the boxes were not as large as the new app. When it was more condensed you were able to see more multiple airlines and prices all at the same time. The new update is not close to as user friendly as before. Please go back to the way this app used to function.
2016,2,"One of the features that makes Skyscanner a must for frequent travelers and bargain hunters is the ability to do ""Whole Month"" searches. But on this app you can only search by specific dates. 2 stars until it's a full-featured app."
2015,1,I've been keeping an eye on a certain flight I'm hoping to take in February and the results kept showing me figures starting in the $767-$900 range. So of course I was delighted. But when I was ready to book the flight I wanted the price ballooned astronomically to $4k! I mean even with taxes and other charges what the heck?!
2015,3,"After dev resolved my previous issue, all flights are appearing now i think.  But Watched feature seems buggy.  My watched flights would always disappear and i would have to do my search all over again.  Too bad,  it could have been a very neat feature."
2015,5,"You guys did a marvelous job on this app. Saves me a lot of time. I found, however, that the hotel version is cleaner and more user friendly. Although I might have jumping the gun, because I believe you are keep updating this application time after time.  Thank you for a wonderful app."
2017,4,App was good. I used to use for long time. In the recent times the ticket prices are consistently incorrect. Latest one was from Chennai to Bahrain.. May End dates. It gave incorrect prices. The airlines provided different prices. I deleted the app.
2015,4,"This 'anytime feature' helps me to find a cheapest airflight ticket. Very good application to compare flight tickets among many airlines. However, sometimes the price shown in chart isn't same with result."
2015,5,"This is a great App to help you find good travel tickets. I used kayak a lot, but since finding this I use skyscanner more. I like how you can put in your departure city and put anywhere for the destination, so you can see what deals are out there that you wouldn't of normally thought to travel to."
2015,5,"The screen just goes white after selecting the app until it times out and askes to force close or send a report. Ive done both already. After reinstalling it several times and crossing my fingers, it is working normally now.  Thanks!"
2015,2,"At first this app seemed easy to use.  It found good flights but when I  tried to book them I was sent to a different site.  That site didn't have the same flights and I basically had to search all over again.   So I tried the CheapOair app, found cheaper flights and did all the booking within the app. I won't use this one again."
2015,4,"There was some discrepancy between the fare the app found and what i was actually able to book.  Got a better deal on slightly different flight times,  so can't complain!  Thanks for a great app."
2015,5,Skyscanner is a perfect app. for those who like to travel on a low budget ... it gives you all the available options for the flights and opens the sky for you to choose from :) ... I will definitely use it every time I need to fly ... thanks Skyscanner for making things that easy
2015,5,Great at finding low fares which is all I want.  I prefer to book directly with the airline.  I have had no problems getting the rates found through the app. Love it!   -Using Samsung Galaxy S3
2015,4,"Easy way to see prices variations and find the best options, a must have app. As improvement, the filters should be placed on the same screen as the results otherwise there is a lot of back and forth needed."
2015,5,This app is easy to  use and very convenient. It saves you  the time of    having  to carry out  the  research  all in the palm  of  your  hands. Also gives you  options  so you can choose  what's best for  you
2015,1,Tried booking using the app and was redirected to fare geek. Didn't provide me with my e-ticket nor did they charge my account after booking the flight. I looked for a flight with Kayak after my bad experience and I had my e-ticket within about 30 minutes of booking the flight.
2015,1,"I liked this app, but why does it have to install as a service and be constantly running in background? I only use it very occasionally. I am sick of apps that think they're more important than the others, so I deleted it."
2015,5,"Als het gaat om het vinden van goedkope vluchten is er geen betere app dan deze. Eenvoudig, onafhankelijk en duidelijk. Voorkeuren invullen, zoals vertrek en aankomsttijden, en meteen worden de resultaten aangepast. Mijn appsolute favoriet! *** Update 10 Jan 2015: Net GoEuro app getest. Deze vond de beste retourvlucht naar Athene bij Skyscanner!!! ***"
2015,1,Every time I search a flight I tick the direct box and it never gives direct flights. So far a flight to zadar in Croatia is gonna take me 25 hours with 2 stops from London. I'm gonna take the unicycle instead.
2015,4,Nice and user friendly App that is a good guide to the fares you will get on other travel sites. Only booked a flight once from the site but found it very easy to navigate the booking process.
2015,4,"It's worked great everytime, no issues. Used it all over and it gives good prices. Sometimes carrier websites are a little cheaper but I mainly use SS as a starting point. Never leave home without it."
2015,5,"I love to travel all over the world and this app does a great job finding the best fares from many sources including lesser known ones. It isn't always a 100% accurate in the fares it shows. However, this isn't something attributed to the app. Fares change frequently and not every source is diligent in reporting fare changes as quickly as others. That said, I highly recommend this app above all others."
2015,1,$333 for round trip ticket from Denver to Kansas City. TripAdvisor has same flight $134. Hmmm guess who I'll never use. Rip off
2015,5,Hands down provides the best prices for flights. Expedia and Kayak does not even compare. Great interface and very user friendly App.
2015,5,Used it in airport to find quick rerouting options. Simple and fast. Would recommend adding multiple city/destination approach in the future. Cheers!
2015,4,"Turns up more flights than I knew existed. Had some display problems, but a simple uninstall and reinstall cured that. My only quibble is that the airline names in search results are tiny and hard to read."
2015,4,This will tell you the lowest price on any date on any route! Then u can directly go to the airline website and book the tickets! Helped me book the cheapest flights so many times. Must have app
2015,3,"I wish it could find flights in more flixible manner. If there are no flights for specific days, I'd like the app to offer options."
2015,4,"The app is great and easy to use for all user. However, the price shown in this app doesn't match with the price you actually pay because of service charge from some agency and credit card fee"
2015,5,"I find that this app allows me to plan flts according to airline,flt duration,stops enroute,shows highs and lows.  When i choose dates and flts destination allows to go to providers to book flights. Easier to find flts rather then kayak or others that make you select different sites to check prices."
2015,3,"This app (and other flight apps) need to allow clients to select each leg of the trip rather than forcing us to choose only fron the 'packages' built for us. If you want a 5 star rating, then provide that at the very least."
2015,4,"This app is great for comparing flight prices across a wide scope of different airlines and dates to find the cheapest options available. I don't always understand the chart view though (which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5) - for example on some days it shows the flights as being ridiculously expensive, but out of curiosity I selected one of those days, but still ended up with some relatively cheap options (it made me wonder what I might be missing out on because I tend to avoid those ""sky-high days""."
2015,4,"This app makes it fun to plan vacations. I can find fares for virtually any location. It is most helpful, when trying to decide on a new place to visit."
2015,5,I really like skyscanner it gives me plenty of options and choices.  Its really easy to use. Its saves all my favourite flight searches.
2015,1,"This used to be a great app. Now, no matter what date, time or destination I select it says ""no results"". I tried uninstalling then installing. Same results. üòï"
2015,1,"I was shown one price on Skyscanner and when I went to book it, it was $300 higher! I emailed Skyscanner and will change this rating if they give a satisfactory explanation and promise to fix this problem."
2015,5,"I've used this app more than once to book flights, and it will do all the hunting for flight deals within this one app. Highly recommended!"
2015,5,Booked my flight so easy. Good you can watch prices go down in certain time of the year. Thank you Skyscanner
2015,5,This app is very helpful for flexible travelers like me and my wife. It shows the cheapest flights anytime during the year helping us save sometimes $1000. Great app!
2015,3,After the new update it only filter 2 airlines. I can't change it to include other airlines. Help please?
2015,5,"The app works perfect on Samsung S3. Excellent searching criterias, very good prices, no glitches. Thank you skyscanner team"
2015,5,"I have used this tool regularly for last few months. It's the quickest way yet, that I have found to search and compare all possible flight options."
2015,3,"Been using it for a couple of years now, however I found that sometimes the site it directs you to, has more options at cheaper prices. Waiting for a multi destination option :)"
2015,5,"At first its little bit confuse, but then it helpfull. I will start my journey thanks to the app."
2015,5,Just booked tickets for New York at the start of August for a third of the price both virgin and BA were quoteing!! The app is easy to use and takes you directly to your desired company to book flights at no extra cost!! Would highly recommend this app!!
2015,4,"Nice app, live prices and always the cheapest. They could install a setup where I can get a price alert when something is below a certain price, that would be most awesome and demand increasing."
2015,1,There is no way to stop the search bringing up dodgy travel agents like OmegaFlightstore. Don't use. Very untrustworthy.
2015,5,It always finds the cheapest flights for me. Fast and super reliable!  Best tool on the market.
2015,3,The app shows prices for international flights about 25% lower than when the dates are booked. This is highly suspect. Please fix this discrepancy.
2015,3,I wouldn't trust the app for the lowest SYD-MNL-SYD flight fare...the lowest they provided was almost 1k when you can get one for as low as 700 on a CebuPacific direct flight...I'm no CebuPacific employee nor an endorser but it's just disappointing...I was hoping I would find a much lower fare than what CebuPacific is offering...
2015,2,"The prices are not online, the earlier searching price is not match with the later one. Please update it and make it work."
2015,5,"I was a bit discouraged because I waited last minute to book my flight, which meant more money. Not only did I save money but it was cheaper than what I was used to paying (DCA-FLL, usually $2-300, last minute about $4-550. I paid $120)"
2015,2,"How is it that this app is unused on my phone for weeks, and it's still draining 5-8% of my daily charge. That's not right."
2015,5,"This app is great. Works very well, is easy to use and free. Can't ask more."
2015,4,it is really a easy to use app with a nice usage flow and it provides tons of reliable information. Unfortunately the listed prices often turn out to be inaccurate though.
2015,5,Very simple and easy to navigate. Filter works great. Great for International travellers too.
2015,5,"User friendly interface, updated and great deals! Using for all my flights lately :-)"
2015,4,"Good, but it could have an option for one-way ticket only, sometimes we don't have a exactly day to return or it's not necessary."
2015,5,Great place to start. Be cautious of any third-party sites as they are not always reliable but this app is very useful for planning your trip!
2015,5,This app is great is you have a time frame and budget in mind but don't know where you want to go. Love searching for flights to Everywhere and seeing what I can find!
2015,5,Fantastic. A real deal app! Don't miss out. Get this app!
2015,5,"Sky Scanner is great for planning your holiday, it compares all the flights and if you aren't to sure where you are flying from you can search from a country instead. You can also select Everywhere as your destination if you want a bit of spontaneity!"
2015,3,Use to find cheapest airline . Then book on airlines  app as find there much cheaper . Other charge so many extras price never is as found .
2015,5,Great app with flexible features like being able to search for cheapest deals over a whole month at a glance.
2015,5,This is one of the best travel apps I have used. Gives choice of multiple airlines plus dates around the chosen ones helping to make the decision to fly at a price and time suitable to you.
2015,4,Love the price chart.  Let's you know when prices are highest and lowest. Great on the go.
2015,4,Not 100% accurate but truly gives me a very good idea at how much I'll be paying. Great app!
2015,5,Like the app soo much. Just keeps it simple. Scans almost all the flights. So commission charged so cost is same as the flights website.
2015,1,"After I selected best flight; app takes you to Bravo to complete, however flight date changed from Feb 9 to Sep 2."
2015,3,There's no result after update version. Please fixed this problem
2015,5,I was a Kayak man for years...no longer. Love the filtering and the user interface!
2015,5,Amazing app. I use it all the time and have encoraged my friends to do so aswell. I haven't had one problem as of yet.
2015,3,The widget has disappeared after last update....why? It was so useful....
2015,2,"Recently noticed that the app prices are different from booking prices , used to be more accurate , disappointed,  I've  found some really good deals in the past ."
2015,4,With many airlines offering carry-on only flights it would be good to be able to have a checked bag option and see the baggage allowance in the results
2015,5,Love how fast it gives you all the flight options.  So handy
2015,5,Love it  works great and very helpful.  Please add multi trip function
2015,5,The best app around for finding those flight deals. Happy to use it
2015,5,Best prices. Always in back of plane but I save money. Lots of choices.
2015,5,"So far the best app for flight search. You can choose a whole country an the while month, which helps a lot for flexible searches."
2015,4,This app tells where cheap tickets are hidden on calendar. Find cheap airlines
2015,4,One of the best application and give you the option to choose the best deal.
2015,5,Tuesday at four is insane! I flew from FLL to O'Hare for 49$ one time and then 65$ to Houston!! Love this app
2015,5,This app is awesome! I would highly recommend better than webjet! : )
2015,5,This is a great app which works well and helps to really find the best deals available.
2015,4,"Seems to work well but never sure if its showing all flights,an essential tool for holiday planning"
2015,5,Exactly what I'm looking for. Always gets me the best deals on flights.
2015,2,I took ticket to India. .but it ask me every time round about 100 euro more than it shows
2015,4,"Great app, only reason giving at a 4 and not 5 is that final prices are often different from initial pricing."
2015,5,Great app wouldn't be without it . It's makes life easier for the high flyers whom use flights frequently . It's never let me down so far so good & iv had it for a lifetime lol ..............
2015,4,"If you are neurotic to plan your trip, and you  want  to  everything to be perfect. Try this app!"
2015,1,Tried to book but not working. Complete crap app!
2015,4,Simple and easy to use. Recommended app when it comes to search for flight prices and more
2015,4,Traveled alot but i would like to see the option of changing or recomending a near or other airport to save money or duration
2015,5,"Hands down this app is the best way to find your best priced flight. If your dates are flexible, the monthly price chart is ideal."
2015,5,Very easy and convenient to search and book flights. Thanks
2015,4,Keeps me up to date on the best priced flights! Pretty cool!
2015,5,Just booked a flight using it. Found the cheapest options.
2015,4,Easy to use and useful to seek affordable tickets. Great job guyz
2015,1,"Really crazy app, the results are totally  wrong with prices that have nothing to do with reality."
2015,4,Great way to find the best deals without having to search all the Web.  App is well laid out.
2015,4,"Very useful but do not forget about charters,travel agents,and the ferry!"
2015,4,Easy to use and convenient way of finding deals but sometimes it doesn't show prices for the surrounding dates
2015,4,Easy to use. Great way to get ur flight time and costing.
2015,4,"I just downloaded this one, found it very useful already. I'm glad I found this one."
2015,4,"Easy to use, although sometimes the price located is VERY different from the one eventually quoted"
2015,3,"i choose the 1 stop only flight but when i proceed, it turns out to 2 stop flight"
2015,1,Last time i see wrong prices only. In app and on web.
2015,5,"Simple and easy to use, in my opinion better than the website as it shows the price for each day exactly. Love it!"
2015,5,Love this app... Also use Google flights between those two apps you will find the cheapest tickets available
2015,4,"The app is amazing, but sometimes the prizes are not the same it says"
2015,4,"A great app to search for flights, save cost and time!"
2015,4,Great app but some of the prices are not as small as they seem
2015,1,It's not accurate at all for flights in India and does not provide any details
2015,5,Hands down the best website to book flights. Been using this for years and it has never let me down!
2015,5,Very nice software is skyscanner always it first-hand ticket and flights thanks (replying me fast)
2015,4,Makes it very easy to check possible routes and prices from different UK airports
2015,5,Brilliant traveled most of Asia booking flights on the day with this app. Never any hassle.
2015,4,Would thoroughly  recommend  checking  this  app before booking your flights.
2015,4,Easy to use but it'd be better if we can search in a multicity mode
2015,4,Works well. Very accurate.
2015,4,This is a very great app & easy to use. I enjoy the convenience of it
2015,4,Its reduced my time to search each airline and its more easy to use

2015,5,Very useful for those who want to find best prised tickets. It helps you to make the best journey with good memories
2015,5,"Easy to use, quick, reliable. Consistently the best flight prices"
2015,4,"Always easiest option,can check while month at once."
2015,1,"I'm new to this app...Every choice I put in, no results.  Is there a fix?"
2015,4,Does not support multi leg trips or returns from a different location
2016,1,New update messed it up. Deleted.
2015,4,"Best app for comparing flights, not all prices are correct though, and the app can be glitchy"
2015,2,"Web page is much better, the two find both different prices"
2015,5,"Even if I don't end up buying through this app or website, I always check it first for my flights."
2015,4,Would be even better if they show promotion of airlines
2015,2,Mungkin ok....tapi waktu daftar lewat android ....koneksinya susah ...apalagi waktu nulis data penumpang susah bgt
2015,4,Just sometimes it says a price and when you click it and go to website price changes.

2015,5,I looooove this app
2015,5,Grand neo
2015,5,Works well
2014,2,"I think there are too much bugs with the software. First, I am not sure because of history or what reason, it did not shows up correct price. I tried to clear history but it still behave the same. Example: it shows lowest price of rm181 on particular day but I could not find this price at all when I try to retrieve price. Second, there are days shows up without price. 3rd the direct only is ticked but still returning search for both ways. Hah.... The 3rd bug happen after the latest update"
2014,2,"Prices when browsing sometimes differ few quid which is acceptable, but not from 100 to 300 jump. It is quite a lot of such a huge misprices around. Good feature could be viewing on the map option for a list of airports in defined countries. Sometimes i am just looking for cheap destination for 2 or 3 days. Have to browse where those airports are. Other thing is when selecting outbound flight, prices for inbound are changing. How that is possible? And it is not few quid, but from under 200 to 500! Shame."
2014,3,"Used to think it was great now 1) it will show a price you think great that's a good deal, click in and the price jumps sometimes to more than double (noted by other reviews here)... 2) some of the sellers it links you to get terrible ratings on trip advisor etc - I want to buy a ticket with confidence I'm not going to get scammed... 3) also suggested here, multiple to & to search e.g from LHR or BHX or MAN for example (ITA matrix does it well)... 4) search business class and sometimes you get economy fares"
2014,1,"When booking my first flight this app send me to a website everything was find got a good price and something felt off. Flight was OK. But the credit card that I used for the first time and only time to book with this app was cloned and used in California. Now I'm stuck on vacation without my main credit having to used my savings, I may have to sell my camera or cell phone and messing up my plans. I'm not in the us where can go to the bank. Don't used this app unless you want the risk."
2016,1,"UPDATED 7.20.16:  It's as if the people who are creating these updates have never even used their own app.  Getting rid of the search function to search 'everywhere' or just a specific country?  That's the only reason I've been holding out from the last major ""update"".  Getting rid of that feature makes this just another useless flight search engine.    Honestly, do you even think these things through, Skyscanner?  I'll be recommending other apps until this is fixed."
2014,3,Not sure if some of the cheaper ones can be trusted having done some research and occasionally I am able to get a cheaper deal going direct to airlines site as I did earlier in the year to travel from Perth to New York nearly 700 dollars cheaper. It is handy sometimes to have the widget for a rough idea of prices. I almost booked with eDreams but a quick Google search told me that most people had a negative experience with them.
2014,2,"Apparently, I got a flight booked but I didn't get a link to my confirmation. Didn't even get a receipt. Just a phone call asking if someone could charge my card, which seemed kinda shady. I had to look up the number to call the airline & do the leg work myself. Clunky and not really the most efficient app."
2014,2,"Needs a quick fix. Works great on Data but not on WiFi. Always error message ""Search needs internet connection""  Previously ok. Otherwise 4 to 5 stars rating for apps. Reinstall as advised but same error msg. Can login by WiFi so nothing wrong with internet setting."
2014,1,I will give one star to skyscanner because their partner traveltrolley is a fraud.. Once payment goes through they will blackmail you by asking a clear photo of your debit or credit card if you say no they will cancel your ticket and make you wait 2 weeks for refund and you end up canceling or changing your plan to travell. Stay away from dodgy TRAVELTROLLEY..
2014,4,"Excellent service and excellent app. The app is so well crafted, it is actually better than the website! Three features they should add that would make it perfect: 1) search from/to multiple airports (e.g. from LBA or MAN) 2) multi-stop itineraries 3) filter airlines by alliance (e.g. oneworld, star alliance etc.)"
2014,1,"Does not work. Search a specific date, eg today, to go anywhere. Next page shows list of excellent prices for today. Next page shows a bar chart with prices for each day and not one day shows anything like the price shown on page 2. In other words the prices offered in the open search for a specified chosen day do not exist. If I did not know the main site to be good, I would say this is just a scam but I know SS better than that.  Screenshots available if SS give me an email address to send to"
2014,2,"When you pick flights by time slots the app opens your selection and the hours available for booking don't match your selection. If it says 10pm on the selection, it may say 8am for the actual booking. It's whacky. I hope they revamp and fix because the concept is great."
2014,4,I always come to skyscanner if i am planning a trip.. it just brings up lowest fare and helps me to plan my travel. I even win arguments with my travel agent showing the prices listed here. Reason for giving 4 is non availability of Multi city option otherwise 5.
2014,5,"Eg: I want to know fare for Singapore to Melbourne for entire month of December by Singapore airlines. Dec1st, DEC 2nd, 3rd..... Dec 31st.  Simply  rout from to to, airline, month finally I can able to see Singapore airlines price in that month with every day price for entire December month. Many people book flights not only based on cheap fare and particular date of journey . they prefer airline also. If u add this feature it would be a great time saving ."
2014,3,"MEA- middle east airline; one minute is on skyscanner and the next the booking is no longer available...they drop people after  booking process has started, and i wander why skyscanner allows this to happen!   Its very confusing when you see flights available but not real. Be aware when you try MEA! Not a honest airline."
2014,5,"I always travel at least 4 big trips accross  the world every yead, and I always check flights in Skyscanner because the combinations they handle are just unseen anywhere else on the net. A little con is that they aggregate results of other providers so sometimes the don't have the update prices for the month view if nobody searched for that particular dates, but still they performance  and power of the tool is awesome.  Thanks for saving me that much money!"
2014,4,"I had both a positive and negative experience with this app however the company that I made the ticket purchase from was quick to make right the negative experience, so overall a pretty good app. It's a great search engine for finding up to date prices. The negative experience was (in my case) the delay in getting a confirmation for my flight however when I called the listed number a very polite representative was able to fix my reservation without any trouble. I will keep the app."
2014,1,"Previously rated 5 stars but now it says there are not flights from chicago to Denver for the whole month of March. Also tried Vegas and ""no results"". Used to be my go to flight app but now doesn't work. I uninstalled and reinstalled, still not working."
2014,5,"This is my ""goto"" app for locating the best deals on air travel throughout Eastern and Western Europe. The listed prices are seldom, if ever, beat!!! I have used this app to purchase tickets to Paris, Istanbul, Warsaw, Budapest, and many other places.   Its a must have for any globetrotting adventure."
2014,1,"I downloaded this app, and tried to use the chart feature to look for better priced dates. It told me that one of the airports I selected wouldn't allow me to use this function... NYC -&gt; ATL??? What airports does this feature even work for? Completely useless."
2014,2,"If you could add a possibility of searching from multiple airports in one area (Birmingham, Manchester, London Luton) to multiple airports (Berlin, Szczecin, Pozna≈Ñ) in another area by selecting few it would make it an ultimate connection app! Right now... nothing special."
2014,2,"Prices look good for certain airlines, but usually you are directed to 3rd party websites that have a lack of information, have flight timings that don't match the actual timings on the airline's own webpage.  Do check for online reviews of these 3rd party websites before purchasing. The app itself is pretty useful as a gauge, but probably not the best for ordering tickets with.  Dear page admin, I do not need you to follow-up on this comment. I'll stick with buying direct or getting tickets from more reputable online sellers."
2014,2,Clicked on Cheapest Fare $1100. Fare was confirmed $1100 and then taken to Helloworld Website. The website reported not available and best price $1375. Went back to do new search again with exactly same result. Can't trust the APP. Either the APP is at fault or Helloworld is at fault.  Waist of time. Have screenshots to prove it.
2014,3,Trying to book my flights for next and awaiting a good deal. Two came this week couldn't believe the price but thought yes I would book now clicked on the booking icon when it took me through the price went back to original price so no good offer so I didn't book it
2014,5,Great app!! Simply easy to use. Convenient interface and easy navigation. Only thing missing is multi city travel. You should include this to make it a complete one and only choice out in the market.
2015,5,"This app provides me with exactly the right information I require.  It updates price fluctuations very quickly. And for me, a real TECHNOPHOBE, it is very easy to use. In my humble opinion it is the best app of its kind. Many thanks"
2014,5,Have now booked twice using this site and I must say it's brilliant. I find it easier than the airlines own websites to navigate. Its straight forward and idiot proof.....good for me.the airlines should take note of this.simple ticket booking from my phone.......well done five stars from me.
2014,5,"Skyscanner is the most thorough way to search for flights, especially in Europe. For best results use the website on a computer, use all option like 'whole month' and 'to everywhere' check prices on the actual site of bookers or airline and make notes with paper and pen."
2014,3,"I have the same problem that it shows a price and when you click on it it shows different.. and just checked the app, the prizes are higher then website. Whats with that!? Really bad."
2015,1,Can't email them have copied what they are promising on the price and the price goes up by 100s is an absolute joke. Can't find and email to complain to. Really let down by the site and I won't be using it again.
2014,3,I use it a lot! It shows me different dates without submitting each one at a time. My only complaint is that the low price shown on the first screen isn't really the lowest price. I hope that changes soon.
2014,5,"Amazing app , very much recommended for the people who travel frequently. It's helps in planning when you can grab good deal to fly. Once again AMAZING APP."
2014,5,"You know when sometines you have an app that is what better than their own website?  Well that's one of them. Perfect,  works well and free. Thank for making it!"
2015,2,"Not sure why but booking from the app is next to impossible. Prices for international airfares jump by 40%+, whole flights disappeare. Waste of time"
2014,5,"So my advice is be ready to purchase rite away and you will be happy. Remember de are millions of people all over the world serching for the same prizes you searching. For therefore dont expect the same price to be there when you Google. Onto another site. Obviously by the time you come back the ticket you just saw would have gone, Honestly this is the best app. ."
2014,5,I love this app! &lt;3 works well and saves a lot of money! I highly recommend to use it before you book your next flight ;)
2014,1,"Put in all my info gave me an awesome price then...when I went to book it price MUCH higher!!! If I get a flight @ the price promised, I will change my stare rating. I have screen shots for proof."
2014,2,I had been using this app to look for the best price available to take a trip for the past week. From one day to another?? The prices skyrocketed and now I see fewer carriers so my trip home is now double what I had thought is was going to be. Also it shows a price on the screen with all the dates and when I click it?? It doesnt show up on the list.
2014,5,"This app is great - directionally. It'll give you the best days to fly. But you can find better sites with better pricing. At least it did when I compared Atlanta to Nassau at the end of February.   And to be fair, it could be an anomaly, I only checked the one destination."
2014,5,This is my go-to app when searching for tickets. Simple and effective. Love the option to choose anywhere as destination to see prices for all destinations. Really liked that.
2014,4,"Fantastic app, if you enjoy searching for cheap flights. Favourite tool is the facility to search for outbound flights anywhere over the next year and the app will tell you the cheapest places to fly."
2014,5,For when you know where you want to go but have flexible dates this app is amazing. If you are trying to find a flight like tomorrow or that week you should expect a higher price but this app will help you find the best price imo. But if you see a price you like one day jump on it cause prices change daily. I've been watching prices for a future trip that have been dropping daily.
2014,5,Best-in-class UI with tabs for different searches. Usually provides the cheapest flights. Price is consistent with booking websites. Covers many airlines and locations.
2015,5,"This allows you to put your travelling dreams together. Can't see anything bothering about it, so solid 5 star rating. Thanks, Skyscanner!"
2014,2,It's great to find the somewhat cheapest flight. When I go to the chart section I see prices that are significantly lower than they are after selecting them. The numbers do not add up.
2014,5,Saved me so much when I had to book a quick trip. Only app that come up with the goods to save my back pocket. Thank you.
2014,3,A lot of the time they show a price and once you click onto it to book...  The price goes up...  Also how can you have a setting for baggage?? I can't book a flight AND a bag...  I always get screwed at the airport by owing more money for checking a bag...
2014,5,"I traveled around Vietnam using Skyscanner without planning anything before. Good prices,no surprises. Buying the tickets directly from each flight company, without any extra fee. Possibility to compare prices across months. All you wish from flight app and more!!"
2015,4,"(1) information about existence of direct flight is often inaccurate and (2) I prefer the data visualization chosen by Experia for flight vs. transfer durations. Except from this, the app is a killer, very usable and providing very cheap fares ~"
2014,2,Its a great website and the app does it's thing but why does the app need access to all my media including my pics videos and sd card? Somehow toesn't sound legit(?)
2014,3,"I have used skyscanner a dozen time but every time I want to check multi city flights I have to use a different app. Also, sometimes certain retailers will display lower price until you go to their sites and the price increases to almost double."
2015,5,"Everything about this app is flawless. It has helped me find the best price in every flight, and works perfectly. Thank you."
2014,5,Perfect app. I bought great deals through out of the year. Nice option to customize your dates and fares.I liked it.
2014,4,I like the app.  But I had an issue setting up a specific flight.  The app thinks that the Sacramento international airport  and the Stockton airport are in the same city.  Kayak doesn't have this issue.
2014,5,Nothing to report negative I have compared price quotes with 3 or more apps. Anyhow this is the best choice getting lowest prices nice fast search results keep it up and expecting more updates
2014,5,Consistently got the cheapest air fare...... Nice app.  Would be nice to have the option of checking flights with multiple destinations.
2015,2,This was my favorite app but now it won't work. It says select another airport but I've flown twice from Atlantic City NJ to Orlando fl booking with this app.
2014,5,"Great app, very usefull. There is one little thing though, i would prefer a via-search option."
2014,3,"Perhaps its useful for some research, but at least half the prices are way off. It seems like the price database is only updated once a week while airlines change prices multiple times a day."
2015,4,"Since I always cross check prices on other apps/sites, I'd say I get full use out of skyscanner. I love using it to scour cheap tickets."
2014,4,Fantastic service and it often beats competitors like Kayak on finding lower prices. To reach 5 star for me it needs to include multi-city flights.
2014,5,Love this app! So easy to find great deals on flights. I use it all the time.
2014,5,Seqrched and Booked many flights through this app with no problem. Thanks guys. Keep it up.
2014,4,Great app. easy to use upto date and cheap enough. Thanks developer
2014,4,Very good app... The only problem is that sometime the price found is not the exact one from the air company but still good :) I would advice it!
2014,1,Really poor and overly simplistic app. Can't reset to start a new search with return flight. Full site much better
2014,5,Its really cool app and works well with me I can get cheap and best fare with the help on my android.
2014,4,I like it for finding average price and flights...  There's usually cheeper flights on priceline or some sight like that.   Great app though
2014,4,Great app for quick info on all flights for any destination. .. rarely do they miss! I use it often.
2014,1,Prices get more expensive (15-20%) once I submit the flights... even if I repeat the process several times.
2015,3,Lg g3 icon missing could not search for it. Reinstall and icon still does not appear. Only way to load the app is through the app store click open. Please fix.
2014,5,It always makes my searching for affordable plane tickets easy and convenient. Thank you Skyscanner!
2014,5,"It is easy, effective, and efficient. No need to dawdle spending our time to call a travel agent for information or reservation, not to mention others. If U see what i mean... Skyscanner makes me feel, ""It's just a small world we've been living in.."""
2014,4,I doesn't list an airport near my parents.   VPS in northwest florida. Other than that I used this app for years and told friends about it.  Love it.
2014,3,"With this application, I can survey the flight price easier and faster. Make me more alert in buying the flight ticket. Tq admin."
2014,1,Every search I try produces the same problem: it errors out and can't search the airport I pick. No search results equals useless to me.
2015,5,"After finding flights i always check with the airlines own site, up to now skyscanner has been 100% correct. Thankyou for this great app, its ideal for my needs."
2014,4,I have had good luck with Skyscanner and although I have not booked through the app the layout seems very friendly and prices even a little better than finding something through Google.
2015,4,"Good app.  Prices change sometimes when you select a package,  but sure easier than going on multiple carriers websites to find prices."
2014,5,"Booked my first ever flights on this app Always been a bit confused by hidden costs and different rules for different airlines, but Skyscanner made things simple. Click, pick, pay, pack, play."
2015,4,It's the first place I go to to get cheap flights on so the prices may vary slightly once you go through to the airline website but on the whole does what it says on the tin
2014,5,So obviously if you see a great price and return the next day and its rocketed that's the airlines fault not sky Skanner! Love this app booked many journies through it!
2014,5,"Simple, fast and easy to use. Great simplicity without compromise the features."
2014,5,"Nice interface, filters work well, and I'm glad to see that the prices shown are actually the price you purchase for (used to be quite some differences in the past)"
2014,4,Only bad thing is that flight prices will double and cheaper options from other agents you can find online won't come up.
2014,3,Most often the lowest price ticket leads to a sketchy website that doesn't honor the price.  Otherwise it's a very functional app.
2014,3,"am quite confused why prices are different, I check the same destinations, same flights and same dates but I get different prices on the mobile app and On Pc. Website.."
2014,4,"I am looking for a cheap one way ticket to Victoria BC but having trouble with the prices so expensive, fine me one for Tuesday please"
2014,3,Please merge all the apps into one Skyscanner app. It makes no sense to have them separated.
2014,5,Oh so smart. My wallet would like to make a special  thanks.
2015,1,Everything is just ok prices are good but how can you guarantee me about safety of my money because it transfered me to ebooker. ..I am concerned about money !!!!!
2014,5,I use it every time. Thank you. Great job.
2014,5,I will use this app quite often. One stop shop for airfare. Great
2014,5,Great app. Thanks guys! Love it!
2015,5,It gives you the least expensive days of most airlines so one day you may be able to fly for 1100 but the next day you may be able to fly for 300 check this out my ticket to London with 350 dollars
2014,5,This is an awesome app for flight search. Search options are pretty cool..
2014,3,Why call the app flights in the app draw and skyscanner on here. Very difficult to find when you don't know!
2014,4,"Good, but needed improvement on widget and notification."
2014,5,Rolling chart of cost makes this an excellent tool for planning and getting the best deals for your holiday
2014,5,"I have been using skyscanner to book and find the best deals on flights for years, it is so simple and efficient to use, can't fault it, highly recommended"
2014,4,Es de una gran ayuda y te permite comparar y esoger la mas favorable o la que mas te guste.
2014,4,AlwYs check ot hth er sites but this is a good app and site. But gave it four cause always room for improvement.
2014,3,i got a problem when i am searching fare price is difference .i went to an agency to ask fare price it was totally different. Please fix this issue.
2014,5,Its a unique app in android i can get cheap airticket with this app thanks skyscanner
2014,5,Use it all the time. Useful feature plug in a date and prices to anywhere
2014,3,If you use the month price graph you can see for example on one day 1000 dollar price and when going inside only 150 dollar
2014,4,I would like a simple toggle to see the next or previous day views rather than going back and starting my search again
2014,4,Random ....so ok it works but not sure you get any better deals....
2014,5,I love this app! I had few great deals through this app!
2014,3,I had some issues with selecting flights and making changes. I had to start from the beginning if I needed to make a change
2014,4,"Some errors here and there. Worst part are the dead links, but overall, not bad."
2014,5,This is by far the best way to search for flights online. Works.
2014,2,There were many flights which the app showed but when I click book the site shows that no such fare exists
2014,1,difficult to understand.  not user friendly at all!
2014,1,"Will not reset to search, no matter what I try. Hopeless."
2014,1,"Every flight I have tried to schedule says no longer available, when I go to the website."
2014,4,Sometimes  when i look for flights it glitches  so when i navigate  backwards it goes to my phone home screen rather the previous app page.
2014,5,"Good, fast, accurate. Thanks!"
2014,4,Very good App for comparing fares on different websites and portals on one window .keep it up...
2014,1,Every time I try to search it says not results or couldn't find any flight.don't bother to download .
2014,5,It gets the objective done. Nothing bad to say so far about the app :p
2014,4,"the app was ok to searching and compare , easy widget to book and swipe . most recommended."
2014,4,If u can provide via (for non direct flights) option in search that will be more helpful
2014,5,It does exactly what I want: gives me all the possible combinations to move from one country to another. Brilliant!
2014,1,"Cannot log in to my account, please fix."
2016,1,"Used to be great, not just useless nice pictures."
2014,2,Flight prices jump each step of the way hundreds of dollars!
2014,4,If there isthe function of alert for cheaper tickets will be wonderful!
2014,5,Great app. Helped me put the squeeze on my travel agent & keeps them honest !
2014,4,This app allows you to search entire months for the best rates.
2014,4,Very reliable app.but still need more flights to be added.
2014,4,Cool flight search engine :) really useful.
2014,5,I've tried a good many others but Skyscanner is the best site/app by a long way for price and simplicity.
2014,5,I have used it a few times now. Easy and no hidden charges!
2014,1,This app doesn't even know of the Mojave desert that's in California delete
2014,5,"Developers know it works and is great, so they leave it and don't feel compelled to make pointless changes for change sake"
2014,4,Always looking for future travel fares...domestic or international.
2014,5,"Love it, find flights really quick. Used every time before book ticket."
2014,5,Helps search for great prices. You can even customise your searches yo your liking
2016,1,Expensive deals comparing to Google flight prices
2015,4,Missing some flight companies but works fine.
2014,5,Won't choose anything else to check flights and hotels. Thee Bestüëå
2014,5,I really like this app.. i use this app for my 1st family travel by flight on my baby' s 1st birthday.

2014,5,Compare all airlines airfares. Just the app for your air traveling booking---new icon cool color*****
2014,1,"They'll take your money, its a scam!"
2014,4,Really good. It needs few additions and will be the best.
2014,5,"Have used this app loads and found great deals whether for Bangkok or Bristol, so many variables all catered for."
2015,4,I wish they would combine the flight and hotel app though.

2014,5,"Really helpful,love traking prices,  makes it way easier to check if there are any price changes."
2014,4,Worth trying but needs improvement after selection

2014,5,Its okay
2014,5,
2014,4,"The app is great, allowing you to compare flights as of the previous hour. The widget is great too, as it allows you to easily see prices for a flight you are interested in right from your home screen. In terms of improvement, I would suggest 4 things:  First, the fact that you can make ""favorite"" flights is awesome, but it doesn't save filters that you put on that search. So right now, by having a flight a ""favorite,"" it'll remember the dates and destinations, but not any time filters I'd like to have. Secondly, they should have functionality for routine flights -- e.g. if I fly from Airport A to Airport B every Monday-Wednesday, it'd be nice to have a feature that will save that regular, routine trip week by week. Third, I don't know if it has this already, but there should be an alert system whereby you set a particular price and when prices drop below that, the app alerts you so that you can go ahead and buy at that price. Fourth (and this is a stretch), they should let you log prices day by day so that you can see airline prices for a particular ""favorite"" over the course of time. This will help in determining when prices are cheapest/most expensive"
2014,4,"Current version appears to have resolved earlier issues. Now works exactly as one would expect.  Request: enter your start and end point (not necessarily airports), it gives a list of ""best routes"" taking into account time, cost, number of changes etc. The weighting algorithm could be customisable."
2017,1,"Utter rubbish now since they allowed third parties,was way better when it was direct with airline.  My daughter booked flights via Skyscanner, trip was cancelled within 24 hours, if she had booked directly with BA she would have had a full refund.  This lot she booked with took the whole ¬£490 saying it was non refundable.  So she is now out of pocket of almost ¬£500, and in tiny letters the company wasn't even atol protected.  Will go back to searching for flights the old fashioned way, but beware and read carefully if you are directed to a third party.  Shame on you Skyscanner what you had was good, not anymore."
2014,4,"A potential great app. Very usable for comparing tickets prices. Fast and works reliably 70 %. 30 % of my search is inaccurate on price. Also, connecting flights seem have less amount than the possible flight you can make yourself with different Airlines. I hope Skyscanner team will resolve these issues."
2014,1,"I used this app religiously when I had my iPhone, never had any issues. Now that I have the Galaxy and I downloaded the app it doesn't pull up any prices for me, no matter the location.  I've tried to do several locations and nothing, it just keeps saying no results found.  Please fix, I love this app."
2014,3,"Feature wise 5 stars! World is is big hop on to any place which offers better flight deals. The feature of from certain place to everywhere in the search is awesome! But only problem is as many people are writing about .. the actual rates doesn't correspond to the displayed one! So 2 stars less!! Hope this gets rectified, I will give 10 stars !!!!"
2014,3,"It's a nice app. Interface wise and all that. But the basic problem is that when you search for flights the prices shown are out of sync with the providers. So the app shows a price and then when I select the interesting flight it connects to the servers again and the price has changed not in my favor. I understand this could happen sometimes but the issue is that this happens all the time, and the app does not even care to cache the new price, and still keeps showing the old price in the same search done."
2014,4,I love skyscanner and always purchase my flights through them  this app is brilliant but one missing feature would be the price alerts! Which are on the desktop version. It would be great if they could add this and tie it into the android notification centre to bring up alerts even when not on the app
2014,1,"Wanted to buy a ticket and was happy to see, it cost $150 including tax but service charge not included. But after service charge and payment mode added ... Total cost $235! At the end I bought from the airline website for $194. There is no such thing as no fee charged website. Very disappointed."
2014,5,I was about to write an average review when I looked at the one below. It was an average review with a few issues. Someone from the company had responded to try and rectify the issue for the user very quickly. For me that was such a nice thing to see. Congrats tech support! Well done indeed
2014,5,"If you're looking for flights, this has to be the best place to come. Some of the search  options are great when you are looking for vague searches, such as any place or any time. There are obviously a number of searches it would be good to see such as ""if I want to travel direct somewhere Thursday night to Sunday night, where's looking cheap this month?"", but perhaps these will come in time."
2014,2,I used the skyscanner app with Nokia lumia and it gave wonderful search results. The results of this android app are not as perfect as the windows app. For the same search the windows app gives better and cheaper options than this app. Please check this flaw and update asap. That is why only two stars.
2014,1,"It always shows you cheaper prices than you finaly get. Plus you have to enter the whole flight data again in the website they transfer you too. I will try in a week again, if still price cheating ==&gt; uninstall,..  Little change: I installed cheapflights. Prices on the dot and you do not have to re-enter fkight data. Uninstalled skyscanner...good bye"
2016,2,The older version is so much user friendly and easier to find flights. The new upgraded version is confusing and it just doesn't interest me to use the app anymore. Desktop versions are better. :)
2014,3,"Great app but just for a round trip, I love Skyscanner when booking my flight but the major problem is I can't book my multiple city flight with it which gives me a minimum opportunity to use Skyscanner.  Please upgrade this app. I will have given it 5 star but now just 3."
2014,1,"Please add some Indian destinations where there is direct flight from Delhi like- Pantnagar, Kulu and Agra. Also, when you search From Delhi To Everywhere direct flights, you get to see so, many countries where there is no direct flight from Delhi. Syria, Tanzania, Ukraine to name a few. Could you please remove these from the list and make search more accurate."
2014,3,"Prices are incorrect, almost always! If you're searching for domestic flights, know your carriers. Much easier to check 3 websites than be let down when prices are 100s more expensive. I travel frequently as does my partner, better to sign up for frenzy fares and price drop alerts for your regular routes"
2014,4,Doesn't always get you cheapest or best route but 98%of time gets  you where you want for a decent price. Only recently  though it will give you a price then when you click on airport or price it gives you a different price.  My husband and I were looking at same time.  He got  cheaper  prices than me.  However i aways use.
2014,1,"Just tried to open app. Clicked on city I want to fly to, screen goes completely dark...Uninstalled app, reinstalled and it still does it. Using Galaxy S4. Disappointed..."
2014,3,Loved this application until today.  I wanted to book a flight... it was on Southwest Airlines and when I clicked on it... all southwest flights are no longer available. .. I can't find any way to reset it to previous settings.  I even tried to uninstall the application and download again.  So frustrated. ...
2014,5,All flight deals at your finger tips. Would like to see skyscanner process booking as well. Don't trust 3rd party websites to give Cc info.
2014,5,Anytime I even start to think about taking a trip somewhere this app gets pulled up first. It's gives me the best prices around and it allows me to customize many options for all my flights. I wouldn't buy a ticket without coming to this app first.
2014,4,Your one stop shop for all your flight needs. Sometimes flight prices go up and don't include airline administration fees. But a great app looking at a rough idea of prices to new destinations.
2014,4,I used this app both on ios and android and it works fine! I hope in future more airlines with competitive fares will be added to it as I don't find many competitive fares for South Asian destinations.
2014,3,"It needs more features to deserve 5 stars, like I would like to have an option to see the prices for an entire week, or having multiple destinations option, select the best airplane or the most trustworthy website to buy my flight ticket."
2014,4,"Love the app, no complaints there. However, I spent a while really confused by not being able to find the app in my app drawer or settings. Eventually realised, I think by accident in the end - don't call it ""Flights"", call it Skyscanner!"
2014,3,Do you need access to my files and images? Please address so I can re-install. Location I understand.  Thanks
2014,5,This is my favourite website and app for planning a flight if my dates are flexible and I'm looking for a deal. I love the way I can compare prices on different dates and their prices are the best too!
2014,3,Love the cheap prices. But the number to book tickets on the phone isnt connected?? im worried its not legitimate
2014,1,"Searched for few flights and the price shown on the app was almost 200 less than the actual ticketing site in one case and 400 less than the site in another case, the ticketing site being bravofly. This defeats the purpose of using skyscanner."
2014,4,"Very useful, but if I want to shift same flight to one day back or further I need to go back to search and change date. May be it's better to make it like swipe somewhere, but may be it's already there and I just not found it )"
2014,5,I love the fact the I can compare lots of different prices and journeys. However it is makes me want to just pick up a leave and travel for the rest of my life. Brilliant app would definitely recommend it to anyone!
2014,5,One of the best most useful travel app. Use 'everywhere' as destination and get the best deal out from where you are.
2014,3,Wish that with connecting fights it was more flexible to select the connection you want. Not as many options as the website
2014,5,"Absolutely brilliant, full stop. Am sure there are rare occasions when you'll find special cheaper offers else where, but I'm yet to and I'm quite an*l about checking."
2014,4,"Great, but wouldn't allow to choose date and pad options on Sensation... :("
2014,4,I was using daily tis app. Very easy to find out the chepest airlines... But some more want to improve...
2014,4,I would give it 5 stars if it allowed me to search for multiple destination itineraries. Hands dow  the best flights app!
2014,5,"I use this everytime I book a flight anywhere. Can you take 'Chester, UK' off of the Airport list as no Inbound or Outbound flights go there."
2014,4,"In terms of features its great, but sometimes shows no connection is available even though other apps are able to use internet."
2014,5,"Love it, it's one of the best and I will keep using it for a long time. Thanks"
2014,3,Sometimes the information not accurate. You need to recheck. But still helpfull
2014,3,When I was going to buy the system won't let me and I called for assistance they told me that there was a no there one and i try it out and the same thing.
2014,5,"Skyscanner found me cheap flights to bangkok, it was so easy looked everyday and managed to get them for ¬£450, ¬£200 cheaper then all the other airlines!"
2014,5,"Best app ever I have on flight booking,  best price then all other site like expedia, cheapoair, cheap tickets etc.same flight I booked $67 and cheapoair customers told me price 150....thanks"
2014,5,Frequent flyer. Does what it says on the tin. I look up and book flights with this app regularly. Fine job keep it up.
2014,5,Fantastic app. Takes away all the hassle in searching for flights and prices. Never book a flight without using it now.
2014,1,"I found a really good price on a flight BUT when I tried to book it the price rise twice the original, I do not recommend this app to anyone."
2014,5,Best thing ever... in life. I've bought 3 flights in less than a week. Always has the lowest prices.
2014,5,Very helpfull in popin travel ideas..  Good searching options.
2014,5,This is an excellent tool I use for my travel business.  It gives me results on the go.
2014,1,"This is worthless when the prices are always wrong, use a laptop instead, avoid this app. Uninstalled!"
2014,5,Simple and efficient! Why not having multiple destinations tab? All the best!
2014,5,Excellent app. Takes away the hassle in searching for flights and prices. Sometimes prices are not accurate though.
2014,5,Display of graphs makes it easy to find the best deals and consider multiple options.
2014,5,I simply love it. Excellent app. Excellent widget
2014,3,I'm sorry but the site just doesn't reflect the true fares and it's not just the price changes at the last minute every day it's inaccurate
2014,1,"Cant search flights even if im already online, keep on saying check my internet connections..."
2014,4,"Would be better if had the option of showing flights +/-3 days of requested dates, in a table or such."
2014,2,Everytime I search for prices during a whole month it says I cant bc of the airport city pair. I was previously able to.
2014,4,Find this app to be extremely useful. Would be good if there was a multi flight function.
2014,5,I'm using the app for the last month. Its simple easy. Like it a lot !!!
2014,1,Why is this vey much costly as compared to sky scanner site and this app.. its irritating me
2016,3,Can not rate the app it doesn't open on my tablet... Doesn't work... Too bad
2014,3,Good app but need to improve the search results. The app always comes back fares which not available.
2014,3,"There is an annoying drawback however, there are always a big portion of the calendar not showing prices, which defies the whole purpose of the brilliant idea of the app"
2014,5,"Great airticket rates , great user friendly layout , Love it!"
2014,4,Good app. Best for those difficult-to-get to places in the world
2014,3,The app is awesome but if prices should be put also in other currencies such as dollars and rands e.t.c
2014,4,very good it helps lots as often there are multiple options on flights time versus money ease of Linking flights a good App
2014,4,I like the email alerts and the filters..Better than Kayak in my opinion. ..
2014,4,Good app to get low priced flights but sometimes doesn't find all sales.

2014,5,Sky scanner
2014,2,"Overall, it's not too bad.  If you fly from a major airport on a major airline, then this is for you.  I've used it twice to book a good deal.  Frontier in December 13, traveling from PHX to IAH; then in February 14 for a March trip via Allegiant from AZA to PSC.  Between then and now, somehow the app no longer allows me to use AZA, or Allegiant as an option for travel.  Like I said, app works well, but it's getting a bad rating, due to the previous capability that is no longer provided & bad customer supp."
2014,4,"There is a lot of space for improvement in terms of smoothness of the app. Also, after initial installation I had to struggle a few times to open it because it kept crashing, after I eventually launched it successfully I did not experience the crash again. The interface is great & very user-friendly. The colours chosen for the general feel of the app is also great!"
2014,2,"I used to love skyscanner, but the indicative prices had be now essentially turned into a bait and switch. It can be very useful once you get past this but this feature just adds adds an unnecessary layer of complexity and opacity over the real prices. When this is sorted out I will be happy to return, bit for the time being hunting around the old fashioned way gives better prices."
2014,2,"I love love love Skyscanner and use it first when searching for flights, but this new version of the app is frozen in time on my S5 phone?! I can't get it out of a prior search for flights from NY to London, so it's literally unuseable? Everytime I try to go to menu it just closes the app. It's quite maddening actually."
2016,1,Its a great app. But I dont like the new changes. Not as good as before. It doesn't let you choose the cheapest flights to determine where you want to go. Bring back the older version..I have un installed the new app.
2014,3,"I often fly at last minute and this app really helps find good and some times amazing prices by filling in both dep/des as United States I always click to see the real time prices as the graphs aren't as rapid as real time prices even go to the booking site can show a lower price! Keep in mind many sites are now leaving out taxes/fees etc to make it appear as its the lowest price, which happens even w/Kayak and such! Cleaning your cache is a must to ensure the best pricing as well!"
2014,2,"This app is very slow and when you do get a result is only "" indicative"" of the price.  You still have to use a regular computer to get accurate prices.  It needs improvement.  And a filter to remove Ryanair from all results, you get false low prices because of their Bulls**t."
2014,5,"This is the only app i use for booking flights. I've tried several apps, but none of them are as good as this one! I love the option of having two or more flight searches at the same time so I could compair them. Good job!"
2014,2,"Booking international one-way for business. Found great fare on BA world traveller class (Premium Economy). When directed to TravelPapa to book, fare and class not available. Disappointing."
2014,5,Best app ever booking flights couldn't be easier. Pick your airports select your dates and search.. cheapest flights with the option of alerts for even cheaper flights then click the book flight option.. I use it all the time
2014,3,"Week starts from Sunday, no way of changing it in settings. Week starts from Monday in Europe! In answer on a suggestion/complaint received a generic pre-written reply by customer service to reinstall app."
2014,5,"My fab app in finding the best deal. I just feel the need to add the Arabic language option, would be happy to help in translate menus and commands if needed, just drop me an email :-)"
2014,2,"The UI+UX is great, but the search is slow and stupid (why search airlines that don't fly the given way?) and the cached prices are way off."
2014,4,"Fantastic app, fast, clean and easy to use. Only thing I would suggest as an improvement would be multi centre flight search facilities. Most my trips are like this forcing me elsewhere"
2014,3,The app is good. But you should include an option not only week and month but weekend as well so you can search  for future weekends. It as a week point of the application
2014,5,"Works well. Contrary to other comments, final price for all passengers can be seen by selecting the relevant flight, and unwanted airlines (as well as a host of other variables) can be adjusted via the filters on the search results screen."
2014,3,"Times are wrong for flight duration, prices vary from what's shown on the initial search to when you click through as if you were going to purchase.  This app used to work great but now doesn't."
2014,4,Its an excellent app.. And pretty good to give you the best of options. I liked it. Keep up the good work guys.
2014,5,Exactly what i needed.. i travel by train at no cost.. finding the least expensive flight along the east coast saves $$$$. I take AMTRAK TO THAT CITY.. perfect tool for me.
2014,1,Total failure. Serch showed price of ¬£133 and when tried to book came to ¬£210 wtf? Tried few times ansd same result . joke app
2014,5,"Virtually the same as the websiye service, except the interface is clear and straightforward. This app makes searching for flights an easy process, and best of all Skyscanner doesn't charge you anything!"
2014,4,This app is so easy to use. I love that you can leave the dates open and search for the days that are cheapest. The one negative I have is that when you click on a day the price isn't always what is diplayed.
2014,4,"very useful tool for travellers. Sometimes the prices don't match up, but it's still a great guide and very functional"
2014,5,"The updates really changed this application.  Love how you can put in ""anywhere"" as a destination and it will bring up the lowest prices out of your airport to anywhere around the world."
2014,2,"Not accurate at all. Pretty often the best offer implies 2 different companies, which means different airports. May help, but it's unlikely to..."
2014,1,Fare quotes are no longer accurate. End up going in circles on numerous unreliable travel sites. This app has lost my vote of confidence.
2014,5,"from far the best one. speed and ergonomik. But once you find your flight I usually book via de company , its cheaper :) sorry for that"
2014,5,Maganda sya kasi makikita mo kung saang website yung mura ang mga tickets. Pero sana theyll show payment options like cash or cc
2014,5,I use Skyscanner for all my flights as it gives the best comparisons. This app is just as good as their site very easy to use. I especially like the ability to check the cost of flights between a a week or month etc.
2014,5,"I travel a lot and find this app great! Whilst I do still compare with other providers, Skyscanner is almost always the best deal."
2014,4,Perfect app but I wish the share button would allow user to import the flight to your own calendar with details...
2014,4,Useful to find cheap flight. But the price sometimes could be lower if manually go thru all the date for any. Could be improve further
2014,2,The in-app result shows RM848 for 2 but when I proceed to book it shows $848. That's a lot of difference. Don't trust this app
2014,1,I booked my air ticket through sky scanner and due to unavoidable circumstances I had to cancel that but till the date(After almost a year)I didn't get any of the refund even after so many complaints.Very poor management
2014,4,Great app except for when you are directed to a website and prices are suddenly not available anymore or tax is being added. The final price should always be displayed right from the onset.
2014,5,This is one of the best apps in the market . I stopped to use any other browser websites and similar stuff . thank you!
2014,5,Is the only app I use to look for flight s and to start a book. Since when it has its own widget It had everything this app should have
2014,1,"I searched bombay to Singapore and return. Lowest fare shown was 24597,  for booking it directed me to makemytrip and fare shiwn was 33798. Waste of time"
2014,5,Great app I have had no problems with app or booking. Great for last minute flights too. Booked airfare to Nairobi from USA and had no problems and was cheaper than other sites.
2014,4,"I love this website have been using it for all my trips for the last couple of years, however the app freezes and does not allow me to set alarms evey time only some times, but is good for sharing your findings"
2014,4,Still need some fix...like the price displayed is not always the real one...but right now it's one of the best apps available to browse flights!!
2014,5,I seriously never take time to rate apps but this one deserves it. I never find flights as cheap as i do here. Great job app developers.
2014,5,"Fab! Does give you the cheapest prices, believe me, I've tried to find cheaper but can't! No problem to me to use two airlines if the price is good."
2014,3,"Good app , very useful but please fix some problem...sometimes the price not same with the original page..confusing"
2014,2,"I just want one way fares.  Can't do that!?!?? This site is like a maze, cannot figure the dates out.."
2014,2,Most of flights shown don't include taxes  sure thought I found deals but  once I added taxes  it was double  or the prices were wrong    seems like a few glitches
2014,2,"Where are the prices dude? It does not show anything except dates, and works slow"
2014,5,Best fight app. So easy to use and finds the best deals really quick!
2014,5,Worth it. Widget updates every 24hrs. I Recommend this mothertrucker!
2014,5,Prices sometimes don't match and on mobile sometimes just redirects to the airlines page instead of the concrete flight. Very useful. Good stuff.
2014,5,"I book all my flights through this app, it's so easy to use and you can even set up email alerts for price drops on flights u want. Managed to book return flight to San Francisco last year for less than ¬£500"
2014,5,"Love this app. Intuitive, fast and always there to help me book my flights. Good job developers!!"
2014,5,It makes searches so simple and gives you the options at a glance.  Well developed app.
2014,2,Almost always the prices are not right. Also some of the agencies promoted are really using questionable payment systems. Not good.
2014,5,"I like the fact that you can search without saying exact airport or date, so you can find the cheapest tickets, if you don't know yet where you want to go."
2014,5,"I love this app! I've used it countless times, even to fly internationally! Last year I found a ticket to Korea for only 400!"
2014,5,I hav had this app on every fone ive owned i even told my friends about it its a must hav if u travel alot or just once a year ..GREAT !!!!
2014,5,My wife and I were able to find a flight $600 cheaper per person via this app! Must have if wanting to travel and find cheap flights!
2014,1,More expensive then the air line call center ...from Singapore to Medan one way trip on the 6 sept 14 cost more then the air line web site
2014,2,"The old version worked better, the new one keeps showing "" No Result"" every time I wanna choose the flights."
2014,5,Tried several apps/online portals n finally gotta say Skyscanner is way better than anything out there for domestic flights in India ..
2014,5,This free app saved me A$600 in the first 5min & another A$250 a few days later. Couldn't be happier with it. Cheers
2014,1,I searched for Sing-Han and return on 2 different devices and it showed 2 different results. One never showed cheap ticket and never tigerair (???)
2014,1,It is not workinv. It will not accept any airport info. I used to love it.
2014,5,This app is very gud for fkight booking u got a whole year chart . And obviously find very low fare tickets which others app shows avery big amount m happy and request all of u to use it blind foldly.

2014,1,"Today's upgrade is a catastrophe:  1. For about 2/3 of dates tested, Skycanner returned NO FLIGHTS even for major market city-pairs; 2. System takes 3 TIMES (!) as long to research and return results as previously, even when ""NO FLIGHTS"" is returned; 3. You return flights on only ONE of FIVE carriers providing nonstops in the DEN-CHI market, and only ONE of SIX carriers operating nonstop betwwen DEN and NYC, as examples.  Something went BADLY WRONG with rev.  Suggest you immediately revert to prior rev."
2014,1,"First of all: I opened Skyscanner for the first time, specified destination (LAX) but left 'from' field default (all uk) hit search and what.... from all London airports it only showed Luton! It also showed airports from all over UK but most of them do not have connection with US (Bournemouth was one of them and when you click it, it tells you no result). So what is the point? The other thing is - if you are looking for real (by real I mean price competitive) deals you will not find them here."
2014,2,"When I first installed this app it was great! Sometimes I would find better deals elsewhere but it was good at ballpark estimates. Now? It won't even find me ANY flights! I'm not searching years or even months in advance. I'm looking for October flights, but nothing is coming up. Changed dates. Changed settings. There are ""NO RESULTS"" for me. What happened?? I'm considering deleting this app."
2014,3,"The price search results are dramatically different from the results shown in chart and widget. I love this app and using it for years and I was always satisfied but this annoying issue happened recently which stopping me to find the right flights for me. Please repair it and I will rate you 5 star again, thanks !"
2014,1,Tried to book 6 tickets. Total price came back $1000 more than the individual price quoted times 6. Selected the next higher priced  individual ticket and the total came back LESS than the first total. Selected an even higher priced ticket and the total was even lower. I am deleting this app. Do not give them your credit card number!
2014,4,I would like to see some logic built in that allows some other intelligence to account for transit times between close airports. For example if my closest airport is 30 minutes but there is an alternative 90 minutes away I'd like an advance search option which would show alternatives on the same search but from different departure airports. If a flight from my nearest airport has a connection which would result in total travel time being longer I would prefer an alternative from the next nearest airport.
2014,3,The main problem is the pricing. It tells you that this is the cheapest price and the final figure is more than first quoted. I had to go through all the prices just to find the lowest. The airline which appears to have the lowest fair might be more expensive than the ones that appear to have higher fairs. So be prepared to to go through the results one by one and get the final price and you might get a surprise.
2014,5,"The app is amazing and has helped me book tons of flights at good prices, however it would be very helpful if the team could add a feature for state and continent searching as opposed to just countries. It would be amazing to be able to say I want to fly out of all of Europe instead of comparing each country when my itinerary is very flexible. Similarly, it is missing states/provinces in some countries that would be really useful to have. The best thing about this app is how flexible it is, but that could s"
2014,2,"I've been trying to book my flights for two hours but thanks to this application I haven't succeeded yet and I don't know how much more hassle I can take. Whenever I try to access the agency site, the website gives an error message reading due to web construction your application cannot be submitted which I strongly believe that its all about bloody marketing! Let me get my bloody tickets will you!"
2014,5,"Really couldn't ask for more. Literally. It gives you hundreds of flight options for standard routes. I haven't tried obscure routes yet, but even the shortest route I looked into had dozens of options. I would absolutely recommend this app."
2014,5,"Hi skyscanner team, I love this apps and I have noticed now you added premium economy, business and first class option. However, could you work on putting the option for multicity trip search also? That would help a lot!!!"
2014,5,Quickly checks multiple sites for flights and finds the best deals. Custom filters makes choosing the best route for you easy. We use all the time. Occasionally flight prices can vary dramatically over a couple of days but i assume this is the airlines changing prices.
2014,4,"The app works quite well although some functions can be improved. Its different to web version and lacks the daily pricing and multiple destinations.all in all , a good app to get your initial prices in place"
2014,3,I was unable to find good pricing. A simple Google search gave me cheaper options. I do like the bar chart but without real information always it is not that useful for me.
2014,2,"Cannot login or create account. Will give more stars once I can login. Feedback sent to SkyScanner, awaiting their response (25/06/2014). (17/07/2014) - Still no response from company regarding this bug after contacting them on the website they posted."
2014,1,"I tried to re-install the aplication, but it was still same. When i click ""search"", ""No Results"" always shown up. Please fix. Thank you"
2014,1,Can't book a one way flight.  None of the prices that first appear come through in the total price.    In answer to your question my main gripe with your app is I cannot book a one way flight or even get a quote for one.  I only travel on one way flights
2014,3,"The idea of this app is absolutely brillient. How ever, I think the a flight that would take less than hour listed as 12hr flight time or more is taking the mickey. Unless the app pulls its socks up I will be deleting soon."
2014,4,"It finds so many flight agencies . Few low cost proposals. To much adds that distract from searching. Find only high costly flights. However, it is advisable apps to have for travel booking."
2014,5,Easy to navigate and search between dates. I love the chart you can view price fluctuations across the week all on one screen. I think would be great to have the ability to view multi stop flights though...that gets me a little!
2014,3,"This is a good app. Although,  I've found cheaper fares elsewhere. It easy to use and the filter system works a charm."
2014,5,"Only thing that could be improved upon is if you add hotel search to app. Thank you for decreasing size of app, more people need to do this!"
2014,5,Better than any other search engine. More airlines searched than all the major players. Valuable to our tour company and its clients.
2014,1,How do you change your flight destination? Definately not user friendly. Gave up and uninstalled.
2014,3,"Don't use if you're going to a smaller regional airport. What little number of direct flights they do have will be very lengthy flights, to the tune of 16 hours one way from Phoenix to Bellingham, WA"
2014,4,"I used to plan my holiday with friends during our gathering. With this app, I can check and get the price immediately. Even book the tix. Love it."
2014,5,Overall good UI. Comparison of flight prices & other options presented well. Must-have for frequent flyers.
2014,5,This searches all airlines and shows it without pop ups.  You can scroll to see what dates have lowest fares instead of trying date after date.  Love it.
2014,5,"This gives you every combination of flights you can think of,  all in one place.  Easy to compare pricing with different flight times. Love it!"
2014,5,A friend of mine shared this app with me. I absolutely love it! Now I don't have to use the other websites that take for ever to load. This one is quick.
2014,3,It's used to work well then after one particular search it wouldn't let me go back. The app would exit every time I tried.
2014,1,The pricing layout chart is stupid.  I dont understand a chart that shows a number to the left of the chart and another number down the line and nothing day by day.....
2014,4,I like it it allow you to have an idea of what are the cost will be in specific period of the year. Some times the price are not accurate after you pick your  traveling dates.
2014,5,I constantly tell people about this app! Its saved me money out the wahzoo! I moved far away from my home state and have been able to fly because of this app! Please never go away sky scanner!!
2014,2,"As long as i love this app and use it a lot, but Why is not accurate? ?? Why u put a price while it is not??? After I bought my ticket by 260 $ I find that it charged me 404 $ , unbelievable !!!!"
2014,5,It would be great if the widget had an option of how many days I want my trip to be. This word filter the results better.
2014,2,"Selecting ‚Ç¨71 flight there and ‚Ç¨71 return makes it ‚Ç¨141, but clicking next shows me cheapest ticket for ‚Ç¨266. This is really bad UX."
2014,5,"Great app. You can search any combination, change dates and airports easily and all very quickly and intuitively. Nice!"
2014,1,Tried flight from Seattle to San Francisco. It said it doesn't serve one of the airports.  Tried Seattle to an international city with same results.  HTC One M8
2014,5,I love how skyscanner is constantly updated with the latest flight deals. Recommended! üëçüëçüëçüëç
2014,5,Features that no one else has: keep open more search at the same time; receive daily updates about prices
2014,5,"I've tried all the others.  This one finds the best flights, with the most useful parameters (especially departure and arrival-time filtering!)...  The website is slightly better than the app, but... It's a keeper for me, planning trips while in bed! LOL!"
2014,4,This is one of the best flight pricing apps and services but I'm disappointed the app won't move to external SD card memory making it a very resource hungry app.
2014,5,This app easy to use and has language and currency option for most of country including Indonesia... great
2014,5,I like this app. It's very easy to use and give me the best economical results on my flight search. Good job.
2014,2,"Unable to login with my E mail ID, try to log in, it gives message ""no data connection please check internet connection"" even though data connection or WiFi  is working."
2014,5,Very useful app. I have been buying tickets of this since a year and it has never let me down. Cheers to the developers.
2014,5,Its a great product. Also Craig one of their new test analysts is a great guy as well. He gets 5 stars too
2014,1,International agencies hard to get a hold of. Flight price doubled after being charged twice. Stay away
2014,5,Nice simple aap to search for flights also you can save your preferences ie dates n destinations. Good app must download
2014,3,This app is good I use it all the time however needs to. Be loom at. Prices.more
2014,5,Best widget ever. You can see everyday if any flight is getting cheaper.
2014,5,"Great app. Got me the best priced flights from Aus to U.K., really can't fault it. Easy to use."
2014,5,"The best app i have came across, options around the world, perfect app i was lookin for, smooth UI"
2014,5,The app works perfectly on my Galaxy note. No special permissions
2014,5,"Works very well, beautiful app, excellent work."
2014,5,Excellent app. Has saved me a  bundle.  All in all a  very happy bunny. Year after the same thing
2014,4,Excellent easy to use app. I also use the full version on my pc.
2014,4,"Very ggood App,use a few times and would recomend but..you still hav to compare some flights manually.."
2014,1,London to Vienna offers only 3 low-costs airlines... Waste of time to install this app
2014,5,Very useful. Might have to hit refresh per destination but it really works
2014,2,Why does it quote me a good price when I'm looking at the chart but when I click the total price at the bottom it takes me the next page where the price is twice as much?!
2014,1,"App quoted MYR 4551, went to airline website and the actual price is MYR 14440. Can provide screenshots if required"
2014,5,Awesome app. Best deals and i really like the bar stats with prices.
2014,4,"It's lovely, cheap price guaranteed, but +/- 3 days optional search would be a better idea."
2014,5,I love this app. Especially the widget that shows the top 3 flights!
2014,5,I check it whenever i plan to travel anywhere. It helps me plan ahead. A great Aid to save money.
2014,5,"I use the website to search and am impressed, this app is on another level though! Sooo easy to search and find what your looking for :) well done!"
2014,3,"It's simple and easy. I enjoy the fact , that you can see multiple prices,and dates at the same time."
2014,5,"Thanks 4 this app. Good work, best price."
2014,3,"Useful app, but without letting you do flexible dates it falls a little short of its potential."
2014,5,Well I hv just started to use Skyscanner ... but will tell u guyz n gals tooo ... you wil not find a better site/app ... simply the best
2014,5,The only apps that provides price comparison within months. That way we were able to arrange when would we fly with the best flight ticket's price.
2014,5,I have finally found an app to help me find cheap flights.  I was surprised on how it found other airlines that would not be listed on the travel search engines
2017,5,I Always use it for searching reference for my next trip. Helps a lot!
2014,5,This app is awesome! It finds some seriously low prices! I'm thrilled with it!
2014,5,Excellent app! Most useful to get great deals!
2014,5,A must have if you travel a lot.....gives you ultimate control on your flights......just type in your dates and then use the calendar to check the flights either side of these dates to make some real savings on your flight......essential

2014,5,All other bugs fixed. Works for me on KitKat and JellyBean.
2014,3,This is a wonderful app to search all airline operators for ur air travel requirements. Must also include domestic air connections.
2014,3,It's recently force closing every time i try to open it. Can't open the app any more
2014,4,Doesn't include all low cost carriers but in general a great app to save money on flight costs
2014,5,"Nothing to say. It works, it helps.."
2014,3,It launches a service that keeps running long after you quit the app - makes you wonder *why*!
2014,5,"I don't know how they do it, but they consistently find the best rates and there is no finders fee.  Great app!"
2014,5,80% flights are shown  here ... i have all flight apps in ma mobile but i use only this due to reliability ..
2014,4,Gives me a broad sense of what I might pay. So easy to use and convenient!
2014,4,Very nice app to plan your trip and check prices across all airlines. Filters are useful
2014,4,It is a handy app and easy to use. Helps me find cheaper flights and covers most airlines...
2014,2,"Just get the previous theme back, nobody can understand this pipe chart!"
2014,5,Very helpful with accurate flight information and ticket prices. It proved to me my best companion during my trip to South East Asia.
2014,4,It would have been better if like the actual website the app can select multi-cities.
2014,5,Is flipping awesome! Best deal I got wow!
2014,2,"Prices in date selection are low, but then cannot find them in purchase"
2014,5,"Helps a lot! Less hustle, highly recommended! üòç"
2014,5,Easier to find any flight... Thank you...
2014,4,"Very easy to use, though some flights seen to go up in price when you follow the links"
2014,4,I would only like to see prices on days either side of the selected dates. Otherwise great
2014,5,"Its great, I fly a bit and its always good whenever I organise my own flight or check up on the travel agents choice."
2014,4,Save my time for finding flights. Love that I can sort based on time or fare.
2014,2,"Slow, sometimes I can't do a one way trip search"
2014,4,I have used this app to research favourite travel routes and have found the lowest direct and indirect flights.
2014,3,"Improved performance from 18 months ago but not a great app,for a great flight finder"
2014,5,"Useful and handy. Might not be 100% accurate, but is good enough as an indication!"
2014,3,"But I ll not give it the 5 stars, I cant buy some flights"
2014,5,Totally cool app. I use regularly to call the bluff of cheeky travel agents who are then forced to match the lower price!
2014,4,Just wondering if this app has an option of choosing flexible dates to find cheapest available tickets
2014,4,But need to be better in getting the right flight for the number of passengers in general it is so good and reliable ‚úå
2014,3,Would give it more stars if there were more available flights from airlines such as silkair
2014,1,"The price you show on search, is always different then what you give after processing."
2014,5,"It's so easy, and so far flawless, I actually think the ""any time"" graph system works better in the app than on the website"
2014,2,Doesn't show me the correct flight time and day I am looking for
2014,5,The title says it all... i use it all the time and have the ap price watching my next trip so always get best price
2014,5,This app finds great flights and is extremely easy to use! 5 stars definitely!
2014,5,One of the best app I have used so far. UX is really good!
2014,4,Good app...no need to go to airlines website. All in 1 app.
2014,5,Sky scanner app is very easy to use and is quick. Would definitely recommend it.
2014,5,Would be good in future searches to be able to constrain it with a few preferred airlines. But fantastic app!
2014,5,Very easy to use with helpful filters to narrow your search. Would recommend.
2014,5,Fantastic app! Loving the capability of looking for cheap rates through different days/months

2014,4,I liked using this app as you can easily find what you need.

2014,5,Search prices for almost all planes around you. Price is competitive üëç
2014,4,Some of the vendors that are used don't take the DISCOVER card.  What's up with that.
2014,5,"It is everything it needs to be, shows all the avaliable flights and price. It is easy and simple to use!"
2014,5,"The app is good, but their site on internet is excellent, it helps me a lot on my trip planning."

2014,5,Xtara mind
2014,5,Always updated
2014,4,
2014,4,"App works really well, just had to reinstall one time because it wasnt responding. Overall a great app, lots of search options and good prices. Can't exclude certain airlines but that's not a problem since you can just scroll through and choose what airline you want to take. Use this app if you want to get away to the bahamas for only $250!!"
2014,4,"Having a single place with a nice mobile interface to check a wide range of flight prices is very convenient. Any time I'm bored in a line or am waiting on somebody, I can just flick out the phone and see the best weekend getaway prices. I only wish you could get prices for First Class Seats when you have your destination/dates set to anywhere/any-time.  Plus, awesome customer support! Very responsive, knowledgeable and nice."
2014,4,Skyscanner is pretty and good enough to give 5 stars but today I faced a problem.  For 16:35 go air flight from bom to cok on 20/5/2014 it is showing less price in clear trips mobile page (note: it is higher than Skyscanner in their desktop version) please try to include the lowest price.  I think you have to include more sites including mobile sites and application too. 700rs difference is showing.  Please include wherever we get cheaper dont ever believe only desktop site.  Search with mobile version too.
2014,4,Nice app light n fast.good stats of price to compare.  But i wuld give 5 star if there are arrival n depature timing  additional options. It wuld b gr8 app if we can sort list of arrivals n depatures timing of next 24 hrs of any airport in d world. Its not a big deal for dev to include this option to make it complete app.
2014,4,"I think the ultimate mobile UI for flight booking hasn't yet been found. This is pretty good, but needs multi leg trips. Also wondering if there's a better comparison page possibility for an ""at a glance"" . Best one on Android though so many thanks!"
2014,4,"Only thing that really should be in the app that isn't is the ability for Multi-City bookings. e.g Toronto to Ottawa to Montreal. At present the app only supports one way or return to the originating airport , annoying if you want to book flights to a few places. Air Canada has a good Multi-City booking option, something like that in Skyscanner would make it very awesome indeed :)"
2014,4,"Update 1 May: I'm happy to improve my rating from one to four stars now that the developers have corrected a catastrophic flaw. I'm also  impressed with their tech support (Hi, Niel!) once I got their attention. I might even go to five stars once I've had time to explore the app more thoroughly."
2014,5,"App updated and works fine! Thanks for the work and the feedback Devs.  >>> Hi, as requested I went to your contact form but it only had basic fields so I thought I might aswell provide the details of how the app is not working here.  I have a Google Nexus 5, fully updated.  When I open the app, I get the dialogue box:  Not enough space  Insufficient External and Internal memory. Please free at least 30MB and reinstall the app.  Internal memory free: 18,424MB External memory free: 18,424MB  Needless to say, I have sufficient memory. Surprisingly, uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem.  Hope you fix it soon.  Thanks"
2014,5,"Awesome! I have found some terrific deals. My daughter, son-in-love, two awesome grandchildren as well as my youngest son live in Kansas and I in Colorado. I try to visit as often as possible and this app has been a great help. I just wish I could find a reasonably priced way to bring my dog along as she is a great help with some of my disabilities. Thanks again!"
2016,2,"I use to absolutely love this app, only one I used to book flights. However, recent update has made it nearly impossible to use because it won't allow me to select exact dates I need flights. Disappointed"
2014,3,There is no app icon showing up after download. Program is unintuitive - what is the order of operations? Where can I find my searches. Perhaps some kind of training video would help. Still would rather launch from an icon rather than widget.
2014,1,Can't find the flights at the right price. Wth  Update- having the same issue agai. Shows theres a $98 flight I click it and shows me $195
2014,2,Doesn't always reflect +days correctly.   Example: IAD-PEK on emirates airline indicates +2 but it is actually only +1.   Couldn't find option for multiple destinations.
2014,4,In general the app works very well with all the same filter features as the website. The only problem is when there is a new version the app says I need to get the update but then it won't download and upgrade to the new version
2014,1,"Days 8mb but true bulky size is over 14mb. Doesn't help that it's slow and pretends it's ""scanning"", quit the silly fake animation and do it properly. Clumsy design is disappointing from a large profitable company."
2014,1,Prices totally wrong... just checked a flight one way from dublin to Birmingham only ‚Ç¨9 does not exist. Yesterday showing one way flight to barcelona from dublin for ‚Ç¨2... surprise surprise non existant
2014,4,"I enjoy using this application for finding flights I just wish it were a little more user friendly. If there were some way to save flight information as you continue looking for other flights to compare, that would be great."
2014,5,"Update: Finally ART support so bumped back to 5 stars.  Great app when it used to work but it's been 5 months since Kit Kat was released and still no ART support, every single other app I've tried has worked flawlessly with ART so not sure what the problem is here"
2014,5,"ART support! Thanks so much devs, you guys are legends. There is no true replacement for your brilliant and beautiful app. Perfect. Thank you."
2014,5,"Thanks to the developer for fixing the issue! Was able to use the app, although couldn't find good prices right now... Sucks traveling nowadays haha! But overall is a very simple to use app. :)"
2014,1,"All quotes appear to be without, fees, charges and taxes. In reality the flights are much, much more expensive. In Australia it is illegal to advertise without these fees included in the price. Not sure how these guys are avoiding that law."
2014,5,Easy to use. I like the map and month features when searching for flights and prices. It also saves your searches. Has a lot of airlines to choose from not often seen in other websites.
2014,4,"Great for booking or even just checking flight prices... Usually pretty speedy, even with poor internet connection. Saved me a lot of cash a few times!"
2014,1,Cheap prices are fake. Especially for direct flights. Once you tap to the cheapest price and redirected to one of the cites - the message is 'sorry this price is not available anymore'
2014,2,"There's no app icon, only a widget, which takes lots of screen space. So the only way to start it is to go to Settings- Apps. Odd. Makes you wonder what else is missing."
2014,1,Tried to book flights to Greece and none of the prices provided actually worked out.  7 attempts and all failed quoting price changes.  Other than finding out flight times this app is useless!
2014,5,I know this app from my last bb device. Now on Android is much more better. Very useful for those who travel often. My advice is to take it.
2014,5,Is the best ap...I'm always putting in dates to destinations. .very addictive ..Off we go on yet ANOTHER holiday.. Thanks Sky scanner
2014,4,"I love this app, but now that I upgraded from the GS3 to GS5, I have no widget for this app. No bueno! I love the widget. Please, fix this?! You will then have my 5 stars."
2014,5,"Sometimes, you have a few days free and don't have a destination in mind. This is the first flight search I have found that caters for impulsive souls like mine! To do even better, I have 4 airports within fairly easy reach, so searching on flights within a radius of my home would make random getaway searches even easier."
2014,5,Best app for seeing best days to fly when dates are flexible.  I fly monthly so this is a necessity to me.  Thank you to those who developed this!
2014,4,The app is usefull but have a lack of features. This app should add a alarm to advise customers when their flight becomes cheaper or expensive...
2017,1,"Used to be a great app but now just a massive let down. They don't display cheapest fares, too many inaccuracies and I will no longer use."
2014,5,"Love this app. I get a fair bit of time off. When I do I just select the date and location of departure it gives your every daparture coming up  and connecting flights, and travel time. Good for random cheap spur off the moment trip's."
2014,5,"Ive been usuing sky scanner for a few years now. Its the only place i get my tickets from, and im a regular flyer. Awesome website and even better app :)"
2014,5,"Excellent app. Sometimes you have to go to the individual webpages to check it hasn't missed a hidden deal, but it gives you an excellent idea"
2014,3,Needs to have Canadian pricing and do a better job of validation.  Some of the ticketing agencies are fraudulent or very untrustworthy or both. Otherwise a wonderful app.
2014,5,Nothing compares to this app. And the best part? It is absolutely free. Thank you very much!
2014,5,"Great deals on flights,very good.One very important missing item is that,it wasn't programed for muti-city travels. That sucks."
2014,4,"I find this app really useful, I have now booked a flight 3 times through it. Because I fly to Africa it's handy to use for all the various airlines and it keeps your searches."
2014,5,Issue addressed and works like a charm on the nexus 5!  Thanks to the developers! Good job!
2014,5,"It's working again.  Phew!   I got lost in Newark looking for Omaha in New York.  So it is in Nebraska,  thanks to this App. Jets are back in flight!"
2014,4,"Some joker/¬øcoder? has renamed this app as Flights thus making it more difficult to find (when installed). So, minus a *!"
2014,4,Very useful... Great detailing... Cheapest way to book tickets.. n lot many options to choose from...
2014,5,"Definitely a must for any travel planning, great features and practicality, saves you time in finding the best deals on airlines."
2014,4,"Only used it to check out flight prices, times etc which is quite straightforward, haven't booked anything through it yet, that's why I only gave it 4 stars."
2014,4,It has this unique feature of saving previously searched results in form of tabs. And prices are quite similar to other apps.
2014,5,I live thebapp. I'm just confused as to why it will quote one price for airfare by when u search or select that price u don't get it ! Still more helpful than other apps.
2014,5,"Simply the best, though I have to say I mainly use Skyscanner to get a broad overview over connections, prices, and times, rather than as a booking portal. Fantastic app!"
2014,4,Hope that next update will feature or give notification for discounted/promo fares.:)
2014,5,"Fantastic app, real time saver! The best way to search for flights. Would give 6 stars if possible."
2014,5,"Very user friendly. Doesn't leave you guessing, it really is a useful app to have."
2014,5,"On both my Nexus 5 and Nexu 7. When I open the app it's says, ""insufficient external memory"", and when I tell it to use internal memory the app doesn't find any airports. Edit: It may be because I'm on ART(?)"
2014,4,But missing application based price alerting. With email notifications it's just not as handy
2014,5,Very user friendly..efficient too. Very happy with it..Best assistant for flight search and bookings.
2014,5,"I just think it's one of the best application, designed simple. I didn't buy any tickets yet but the idea of presentation is great."
2014,5,Best flight search experience I've ever had... most often cheaper than all other travel websites... you will be pleased...
2014,1,I looked up a flight found the cheapest one and went to book it just to find out that it wasn't even available at that price. No where near it.
2014,2,"Why am I seeing ‚ÄúNew York Newark‚Äù as my departure?  Double check your search people, you don't want to end up in Afghanistan instead of Florida."
2014,5,"Great overview of flights even to ""everywhere"" as destination. And very user-friendly."
2014,5,I've been looking all over for an app that would search my local airport and tell me all the options of the places I could fly. this is it
2014,4,Great for major routes and big carriers. Unfortunately doesn't work well for smaller routes. Still awesome though...
2014,5,"Finally, support for ART! Now it works flawlessly on my nexus 5."
2014,2,Redirected to another site but you have to enter your information and search for the flight all over again. Prices don't match the site it redirects you to.
2014,4,U gonna need this app. Install it asap On ur mobile. Very helpful.
2014,5,This app is terrific and relied on. I've traveled overseas and purchased tickets via this apps couple of time. This app is really helpful and useful.
2014,5,The most straight forward format. Works fast & accurate...
2014,5,Tried em all. Always end up using Skyscanner. Gets me best process. Allows me to find shortest itineraries.
2014,4,"It's at least a place to checj on flight costs. You save , more when you buy air tickets during the week, and 1 to 3 eeeks before you leave."
2014,5,Have grabbed some great bargains with this app so far. No issues. Love it.
2014,5,"Booked my flight from USA to Chile for almost a thousand dollars less than I found anywhere else, on a very comfortable and accommodating airline, too!"
2014,5,I found great airfare to go to Paris in Summer 2013 And now to Disney 2014. Great app. Highly reccommended!!
2014,5,It is the best in the play store. Loved it!! Booked my first air ticket for the cheapest price.
2014,1,"App doesn't open, it keeps saying unfortunately flights has stopped and goes out of it.  Please fix as I like this app"
2014,5,Love the app. Even has jet blue and southwest now. I buy tickets for all my flights here.
2014,5,Fixed for Nexus 5 and works great now. Good work!
2014,5,I use this app all the time. Accurate and helpful. I fly every 6 weeks and one of the most important apps I have
2014,1,"Yay, scam. Also, the prices end up being higher or there are no available tickets."
2014,4,"Can't share search results. Also price was only for one way.  (not the overall departure and return,  which doubled the final price)."
2014,5,Great app. Easy to use. Quickest way to find tickets!
2014,5,Good app!!! Found many a cheap flight for me and the family. Would highly recommend this app.
2014,5,"A few blips from time to time, but I love this app.  I don't know how I looked for flights before! *****"

2014,5,I downloaded the so and found very useful deals. Very impressed by the app.
2014,2,It doesn't show the lowest fares. It's better to go to sites like Expedia or airline companies.
2014,5,"After the last update the app finally works great on art, awesome!"
2014,2,"I see you now use Air fast tickets, I did a Google search and they had poor reviews from many people"

2014,5,"Awwww yiss! This is the best app ever. Much saving, many flights."

2014,3,I filtered out Spirit Airlines but it still allowed them for one leg of the trip with no option to extend it to both.
2014,4,"Skyscanner is really helpfull and useful. Good app, never presented any trouble while using it."
2014,5,"Works fast, multiple airlines, excellent filtering options!"
2014,4,Prices reflect exactly what the airline website shows!! . Love it always on point

2014,5,Love this app. It's super flexible and let's you compare not just abroad airlines but airports and times of travel as well.
2014,4,"Havent used it yet, have checked for flights and prices. Very easy to use app"
2014,3,Better if you also refer not only biggest airline but also small airlines
2014,5,Not likely to find a better price comparison website or app for flights. Also this app is the best way to figure out what airlines operate what routes and for the best price.
2014,4,Nice app. So helpful to find the best and cheap airline
2014,3,Southwest airlines isn't pulling any more.  It was working a last week.
2014,4,Very good app. Could allow the choice of multiple departure points to get to one city though.
2014,3,Nice interface but KAYAK found cheaper flights from BDL to Dallas TX.
2014,5,"This is really a great apps! However, It'd be better if other services like trains and hotels are included in this apps as well ."
2014,5,Extremely fast & accurate! It's like having your own travel Agent.
2014,4,Will be perfect if there is a Multiple destinations option instead of Single and Return flights only.
2014,4,Often got a very good deal on sky scanner and it's soo easy to use.
2014,5,Works just like the site. Informative and quick.
2014,5,Good work guys. Just wish the airlines could stop overcharging us.

2014,5,"The information is accurate, the search mode is fast, it gives you options of cheaper flights and the option book you flight right away!"
2014,5,Excellent helps to find the cheapest flight in a range of day's great for someone that doesn't has to fly on a set date
2014,1,Loading for search results takes forever even with strong wifi
2014,5,Work well for me. Thanks! !
2014,5,Useful and accurate although the exchange rate used is higher than buying through travel agent or even money changer.
2014,5,"I love it, fast & reliable!! Keep it up and looking foward to more trips using this app:-)"
2014,5,Easy enuf to use. Better than ringing the airline....
2014,4,If the runtime speeds up it'll be 5 stars!!

2014,5,Total awesomness
2014,1,"Completely false, i wasted 20 minutes finding a flight only to be directed to 3rd party website that didn't match anything in price or times listed. First of all, if I wanted to deal with web browsing on the phone ill just go to other sites in the first place - who needs an app to do that? 2nd of all, your app is responsible for the prices you show reguardless of who's error (or baited intention) that was."
2014,1,"Getting error of not enough space in my Nexus 4. Also when trying to enter destination and departure airports, nothing shows up. Basically useless. Was using the older version. Thought updating will correct the problem but that didn't happen. Uninstall is just a click away if I do not see an update soon."
2014,1,"After last update whenever I go into the app, it states I must change where data is stored to my external memory, I only have internal memory (nexus 5) so once I click OK app crashes sometimes, or when it does not crash, it won't allow me to select any outgoing airports (nothing shows in list). Told by support this is due to new runtime available on android 4.4 - told its not released as standard so not supported. So 1 star because app no longer works, but when it does work, its great, pity..."
2014,4,"Its a really good app and makes searching for flights so much easier. I would have given 5 stars but for the fact that the search does not tell you if the flight has checked in luggage included or not so you don't have to spend time going into a site and then coming back out because the price doesnt include hold luggage. So developers take note. Maybe a little suitcase logo with weight allowance in brackets saying 0kg, 20kg, 23kg, etc would help. Otherwise a very good app"
2017,1,"The old car hire app was 100x better. The filters don't work as well on this one, and I really don't need to define my car hire start time to the nearest 5 minutes. Really disappointed that the old app's been taken away and won't be using this one in it's place - the Expedia app is far better and usually gets close to the cheapest price."
2014,5,"As a digital nomad, I'm obsessed with this app! It seems to be the best flight search tool out there. It's simple to search flights to ""any"" destination (whoa) and easy to chart alternate dates to get a better price -- great for those of us who are flexible and searching for the best deal. Love using the tabs to perform multiple searches, too! Solid app with a clean interface. Thank you, Skyscanner!"
2014,3,"What i don't like abt this app is it doesn't have an easy payment settle function. I tried a few times to pay on phone and it always led to different websites and ended up errors or requiring more apps before payment. If it had an easier way to check out like amazon, i would use it a lot more often than i do now."
2016,1,This app used to be the standard 'go to' app for me and my friends when searching for good flights and narrowing down the search to get the best deals for you. Now the app has been updated and made redundant! The app has sacrificed aesthetic merit over practicality. Such a shame!
2014,3,"In general Sky scanner is a very useful and easy to use tool. However, lately I've not been getting any Ryanair results on the app (website is fine). Thing is, my route home is only serviced by Ryanair. This makes things quite awkward!"
2014,4,"used it to gauge dates and prices for a large asia holiday. could do with more airlines included. also a good feature would be "" cheapest flight from here"" for spontaneous travellers. as of april 2014 the app has been broken and not working at all."
2014,4,"P: Thoroughly enjoy this app. Can count on it to provide the cheapest flight options.  C: You can get caught paying extra to secure seats after payment. ""Pls pay x amount to forward your flight request to the airline. Otherwise you will remain on the 'waiting list'"""
2014,1,"I downloaded the App and tried to check prices for two different flights as follows:  Jakarta - Melbourne return (depart 9 March return 7 September) and Melbourne - Singapore return (depart 9 March return 31 March)  On both searches it returned 0 flights. Whole that's a joke in it's own right, to add insult to injuries it displayed an add of another travel website which was boasting $290 flights to Singapore not mentiong any specific dates....   So I shall do this App the favour it deserves UNINSTALL :-|"
2014,3,"I love this app! It really gives me the cheapest flight. However, it was working fine until right now, i cant open the app, when i do, they said i have insufficient memory and i have to free at least 30mb to use the app. My storage space has got 29gb, how can i not have extra space? Please fix this issue, i cant use the app anymorr. Even after reinstalling it."
2014,1,Running a nexus 4 on android 4.4. When launching the app it gives an insufficient memory error and won't allow you to search for airports. What a shame. I used to exclusively use skyscanner but have switched to Kayak... Which works.
2014,5,"Great engine for flight search, easy to use. The search using calendar should be improved and consider filter options. Additional option for best price in range of +/- 3 days would be also great (giving only flights which match the filter options)"
2014,1,"I'd give 0 stars if possible.  Sky scanner offered a great price on a flight, then dumped me on one travel where the price mysteriously went up. Repeated to verify. The final price was no worse than other apps, but the feeling of being conned certainly was."
2014,1,"Don't bother.  What's the point of a price finding ticket app if it doesn't even give you an accurate price on your search? I'm not talking about a couple dollars either.  I was quoted $144 roundtrip on the departure and return screen, then went to the pick your flight screen and it's now $249!! Giant waste of time."
2014,1,"There is no indication of what the price will be until I select my dates, making the app relatively pointless. If I wanted to put in 50 different start and return dates to see which was cheaper, I would do so elsewhere. The app acts like it's going to load the preview, but never does, instead only showing dates on an otherwise blank screen."
2014,1,"Can't access my favorite app without downloading this and I don't even want this on my phone. Same goes for all my friends who can't get into the same app that I can't get into and we get taken straight to this page. Fix this please, because we aren't downloading this."
2014,1,"Very poor! Missing airlines, websites,  doesn't search all the connection and economy one. Only expensive options. I really liked it more before. Right now, very dissapointed."
2014,5,"Better than any other app or site I've used.  As far as it not running on ART - that is a DEVELOPER mode, they're not obligated to be compatible at the moment and you shouldn't give a low rating because you're using a beta feature in Android. That being said it will be a bonus when they implement that. :)"
2014,5,"Great app! Its search trickles through the popular to the smallest travel websites finding THE BEST deals on tickets, that are not only cheap, but also convenient arrangements. Super useful when planning out your next trip."
2014,1,"Absolute horrible experience, prices are fake, 3 different websites were giving a price and then when you were about to pay they would increase it. We ended up going directly to the Finnish airlines website, cheaper and no headache...  Be very careful!"
2014,1,"I search for flights and get no  results (only 2 stops & very expensive). When I search through the chart I can see cheaper options, but once selected it won't progress, goes back to weird results list."
2014,1,"Consistently says ""we are experiencing a temporary problem. Please try again.""   Shame - there are only so many times I'll try again before I go looking for an alternative that works..."
2014,4,"After upgrade to Android 4.4 the app stop working I keep getting error Insufficient External and Internal memory Nexus 4 doesn't have external memory, and I have over 6G of free space in internal memory, but program keep ask me to free another 30MB.  Someone need to fix it"
2014,2,"Application itself is really nice. Has lots of useful features, nice widgets and looks good as well. But... it shows wrong prices which makes it useless."
2014,2,"Does not hold filter settings for same journey.  Journey detail does not include aircraft type. Calendar chart date header fonts far too small for 7"" tablet. Kayak better."
2014,4,"I use it all the time for work travel and for picking last minute destinations. Occasionally when you click the link to book, the price jumps up a bit. But, considering how many search engines it's scanning at once..... Its my most used app, I love it!"
2014,3,"This app itself is great, but do check the prices against the itself! Saved $300 that way one the ""fees and taxes"" we're factored in to the 3rd party lowest quoted price thru app. Otherwise functions well and does what it's supposed to do."
2014,1,Comes up with memory warning saying that I've not got sufficient external memory to run the app (15GB! free). Then when in the app the screen flickers on every key press! Uninstalled immediately.
2014,1,Complains not enough free space despite over 20GB free. No option but to quit. I am NOT using ART as some previous developer responses have indicated.
2014,5,"Works well and fast, easy to use, all the info you need! Perfect to find the cheapest flights! Only downside: does not allow for multiple destinations, only round trips"
2014,5,An excellent way to get good flights for most times the best prices.. I've booked countless flights from Skyscanner and I'm always satisfied. Thanks for a GREAT app
2014,1,I keep receiving a message that I have not got an internet connection and can't receive flight info. How come that I am able to contact you and use other apps.  No problems before upgrade. Please fix and I will review.
2014,4,"This app would have deserved a five-star rating if only prices weren't so inaccurate. You are attracted by low, eye-catching prices which hold very little truth in many cases. Apart from this, the app is useful."
2014,2,Where have all the Ryanair flights gone? For many people this airline is the only option for traveling.  Please add. On the website everything is showing normally.
2014,3,"The price was the same price that I found on kayak, which is the lowest. But the calendar graph didn't work so I can't tell if other dates would be cheaper."
2014,4,Great to look for cheap airfare.  Do look into airline on details some prices do not include bags or carry ons.  Would rate 5 but haven't booked a flight yet.
2014,5,"Gives you a wide array of flight options and airlines to choose from and your search options are easily customizable. Clean, sleak, and organizable. A definite shortcut on your front page."
2014,5,I love the fact that I get the option to see rates available in more than just 3 days of travel date and it also shows the cheapest amount for the entire month or two...This is what separates this app from others. This what awesome is.
2014,4,Works great!  Very helpful have not had problems with it so far :-) Can't wait to see if everything goes well after purchase of a ticket...
2014,3,"Seems like a cool app, but search options are very limited. Most importantly, in my opinion, multi-city and one wat flights aren't included."
2014,5,"This app is awesome, I use it all the time, but right now, running KitKat on my Nexus 4 using the new ART runtime it won't work.   It worked fine with the old Dalvik runtime.   It keeps complaining about insufficient memory, with well over 1gb free, I'm not sure why.   Hopefully this will be a relatively quick fix for you guys, and I can go back to using this awesome app."
2014,1,"Doesn't work on my Nexus 4, it says there is insufficient internal and external memory available, and that I should free 30Mb, and then goes on to tell me I have  1470Mb free on both (there is no external memory on the Nexus 4). The only time it opened, I couldn't search for any departure city."
2014,5,This is a great app. I love to use this app. I think it would be greater if you can add a remunder menu. Which can tell at us if the price has drope or rise. Thanks
2014,5,I use this all the time and have never encountered a problem.  The flights I have found on Skyscanner have been cheaper than quotes out there on other sites/apps.  Thanks
2014,1,Deals not as it seems. You click to buy tickets and you transferred to different websites where the prices are much higher. Useless & waist of time and space.
2014,4,"Love the interface and ability to check flexible dates, where it shows you the lowest price possible. Just wish there was a way to do a multi city trip!"
2014,1,Prices aren't consistent fron the initial prices shown to the next screen.  Useless. Manipulative system draws you in with unavailable cheap prices.   Then tries to get you to call a premium number from your mobile.  Fail
2014,5,"Recently used this app to compare flight tickets. Love the flexibility of being able to filter based on dates, destinations, number of stopovers, time of the flight, etc, which makes this app a fabulous travel planning tool!"
2014,5,"I downloaded this skyscanner app about 2 weeks ago, and love it. I all ready reservations for my liitle sister ,that I have not seen in 15 yrs, to fly up from california to Alaska. I also using this app, I made reservations to fly down to california for our first ever family vacation this summer of 2014."
2014,5,Easy to use. Bold. No lag. Hardly complicated. Find flights cheaper than own airline site. Easy for any android user
2014,1,"I will never use this app again! Charged more then was stated. Customer Service is awful and not helpful, cannot understand English."
2014,3,But the dates you can return are different depending on the days you fly out. Also some routes have no flights for weeks.. Strange
2014,2,"To be PERFECT could be included more Airlines. But the biggest problem is the bug when you find a flight that cost ""X"" and when you click on it, the price that shows is different."
2014,3,"When you select a date based on price and proceed to the next page to select the flight, often there are no flights of that price, which renders the previous stage pointless. In my most recent search, the cheapest flight was 33% more expensive than what it said was the ""indicative"" cheapest price for that day."
2014,1,"From Atlanta to Iraq I found it for 850$ on CheapOair. However, at this app I found the same flight for 1,300$!  It just doesn't make sense.  P. S, I double checked on the web."
2014,1,App won't even open even after a factory reset of phone with no running apps.   Also tried on a Note 3 and same thing.
2014,5,"It works, the layout is simple, and the chart feature is great for someone without fixed dates. I never write reviews, but felt compelled this time."
2014,3,"Doesn't work on vanilla android on HTC one with ART enabled, although if going back to dalvik it works well."
2014,1,I have galaxy S4. After installation of this app it tells me I don't have enough memory space. But I do have 6G available.....
2014,1,"It says i dont have enough internal memory, but in fact i have more than enough. My phone is n4 and running ART mode."
2014,5,Very good user interface. Provide every possible filter option. Able to screen only required information.
2014,3,Good app but its not working anymore after the update :( i tap to open it a blank black page opens then i receive an error saying the app stopped working but even the error message crashes and closes by itself in a second - so i cant even report it -.- please fix!!
2014,3,"Pernah check harga, tapi.. tidak sesuai dengan / pada waktu pembelian ticket.. Mohon untuk disempurnakan update harganya.."
2014,3,Havent used it yet but I typed in a location from Manchester to Rome for just 2 days and it came to alittle over 800 pound for 2 people that doesn't seem cheap to me thats expensive!! :/
2014,5,"Thanks for fixing the APP for kitkat. Skyscanner now works perfect, to find the cheapest ticket for my travel !  I have reset the stars to 5 ! Deserve it."
2014,4,App is so far so good.. User friendly :) if it's showing extremely cheaper rates ll be more happy..lol
2014,5,If your a global lover this app will give you the flexibility and info that you need from any point on the globe. No fuss & delivers the deals!!
2014,5,I especially like the Everywhere feature. Long weekend? Why not see where the cheapest flight will take you!
2014,4,It's good but t   here is some of the country currency not showing like Bahrain (United Kingdom of bahrain). I think you can fix the problem.
2014,5,My best airline selector. Almost perfect. There are some issues that your shown prices and internal prices vary but with  minor variations. Keep up your good spirits.
2014,5,"This application can direct us to almost all airlines at our destination. Hence we can sort based on whichever flight we want! Based on price, etd, eta, airlines.. Especially it can direct to the best multiple flight choices! R Really recommended!"
2014,5,This is so far best search engine I ever used before. It always gives you the best airfare options.   Martin
2014,2,I use this app all the time but   just recently it keeps closing itself every time I open it. Says they are working on the problem but nothing has been fixed.
2014,5,Un app incredibilmente buona e utile. Perfetta nella ricerca di voli e il top √® che il prezzo mostrato √® quello effettivo. Nessuna sovrapprezzo
2014,4,I wish to have next day option on one way only flight not only when I select return date. Otherwise 5 stars.
2014,5,"Just an all round informative,  easy to use app, completely takes the work out of flight shopping! Thanks"
2014,1,"Country screen says '82$ tickets are available for Norway', but when you enter to the country to find that deal the prices shown start from 200$. Uninstalled immediately"
2014,5,"compared with other web sites. Love it! Thank you guys, great job! :-)"
2014,1,"I would rate this a 5 but as of right now, app does not run on Android 4.4.2 Nexus 5 running ART. It complains that there is  insufficient internal and external memory when there is plentiful available memory and the Nexus 5 doesn't have external memory."
2014,2,"Specific flight searches are ok, but the search by month tracker and the widget are way off the actual prices. It's a standard flight search engine."
2014,1,App doesn't work. How do I give no stars! Update has things the app
2014,1,Keeps not showing full listing of airports I can fly to plus the price this update is not cool old version a 5 star this version 1 star
2014,1,App works fine but the prices are random and never in your favour e.g skyscanner price ¬£440 but when you book it's ¬£700 bit of a waste of time
2014,5,You can open multiple windows and save searches. There are numerous ways to sort and filter. I sometimes prefer this app to the computer since this is so customizable.
2014,5,"Getting uptodate alerts are easy, I will certainly recom     mend the site to friends and family.    Thanks skyscanner."
2014,4,This is by far the most convenient app to keep track of air fare. Use it very often. Save money as well Good design
2014,5,I've used it to book my last two vacations - it's easy to use and quick to scan for airfare costs. I've compared prices with other apps and Skyscanner is always up to date and accurate. This app does what it's supposed to do~‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ!!
2014,3,"have an ability to choose combinated flights with different locations as To and From. I mean we are planning a trip from Paris to Amsterdam on bikes, and so we need different places as Depart and Return..."
2014,5,Excellent tool and even better than the Skyscanner website. I always use skyscanner which consistently gets me the best deals.
2014,1,Prices quoted on this app are really expensive compared to doing a normal web search and going to a travel agent. Try $1000 more expensive :/
2014,5,"After an exhausting search online, this VERY easy app was not only a piece of cake to figure it out, but I saved over $200 dollars on airfare. Great job gang!"
2014,1,Won't load. Some bullshit about internal memory. Worked fine a few months ago. Now its hot garbage.
2014,5,It is a very good app to book a flight with cheaper prices.  I booked my flight ticket. Thanks
2014,1,This is the error message I get whenever I try to run a search. I'm running android on a Samsung galaxy player.
2014,5,I can't think of planning my schedule without it. Love it. Thanks.
2014,5,"The best, by far... Listen to the 75,000+ other people who rated it 5 stars...The rest probably has crappy phones"
2014,1,"Keeps telling me there's not enough space on my nexus 4  even though there is, given months to fix but not fixed, uninstalled"
2017,1,Terrible new settings. Old version was much better. Uninstalled now
2014,1,60% of cheap flights advertised by travel agencies on this site ar not available when you get directed to travel agency site to complete booking instead you ar given an option of  expensive flights!
2014,5,Keep up the good work will always support good intentions apps. Thank you very much.
2014,4,the price is not 100% accurate. always check with official website and local travel agency or u will end up paying more.
2014,4,"Pretty good, I like the way that it searches from base city. But I wonder if it could after searches will it let one sort?"
2014,3,"Im searching for some flights and choosing but after that, in the next screen, the price is totally different, i.e, higher than the one in choosing selection, I think 25 million users have the same issue"
2014,5,"This is a great app for getting a quick read on flight fares. You can quickly guage what days have the best rates, and it remembers what cities you recently searched."
2014,1,The app says I only have 7 gb of internal memory and I need at least 30 mb for it to work. Makes no sense.
2014,5,Great application to compare ticket prices via two important variables: Airlines and different days. Whish only if purchasing the tickets made easer.
2014,5,"Gostei muito do aplicativo, realmente se consegue passagens mais baratas,  sem contar que podemos visualizar os pre√ßos n√£o apenas de um dia, mas para o m√™s inteiro,  o que nos poupa tempo para planejar o dia de partida e retorno. Recomendo ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ"
2014,1,It stops while launching. Can't get it to open on Galaxy note 2...
2014,3,So far seems to give all good deals. Need to check it more.
2014,5,one of the best and most handy app i ever used ..... It helps me alot as m in airline (passengers handling ) it saves lot of time
2014,5,For me this app is working Even though it does not give all airlines. Love the interface
2014,5,Dh eggs the by an I will be in the way to do not y for your time to be y for your time to be a new York city of this message and I I will be in the way your email is not be a great day to the time to the best to be able to get to do it u by a r by reply with you have a few days and I in this is your email address is a few days to the first one of y for the last night y for the first thing I am going out with this is the best to the use the first I will be in the way to do you know what r you if Ruth I out of y used to be able t in gcd cut city y in a ry y I will have uui Thank you
2014,4,Excellent app except I can't get past the security checks online. Honestly don't know why it needs my passport no.
2014,3,Thought this app had flexible day flights that can get me the cheapest flight for a range of specific days. Decent app otherwise.
2014,5,Really quite a good app. Works well and finds great deals
2014,5,Imagine all that time saved booked before your eyes at the best price  the flight you want the rout you want cheaper than travel agencies I couldn't be happier for booking a flight
2014,5,"I use for quick check of flight prices.  And I winning allot money like that. Good price,  straight ordering and sorted.  Good app."
2014,1,Does not give the same  estimates in the app as on the home page. Thought more of as. :/
2014,1,"Shuts down after around 30secs  of having it open. I am as yet, still unable to select a flight!"
2014,5,A good apps to search for the best deal. It is as good as going to the respective airline's website.
2014,4,So far I've been able to find much better prices through this app than any other flight search service.
2014,5,This is a life saver when it comes to finding the best price on flights. Easy to use...everything about it is great. Good work
2014,4,"This app has been brilliant but now for some reason everytime I open it it says ""unfortunatly skyscanner has stopped working"" not cool."
2014,5,"I downloaded another app for cheap flights, My Round trip on that app was 512.99 but when I downloaded this app, I put in my round trip same days and all I only pay 426.84...Its a big difference to me and im Happy with this..This App is Awesome..."

2014,5,Easy to use app. Comparison made from various tour agent. 5 star app.
2014,5,"This app makes my life so much easier. Fast and reliable results. Talk about efficiency,  this is the perfect definition of it."
2014,3,"I use and recommend this app all the time, however it does not support the ART runtime, so I've been unable to use it recently"
2014,1,"Prompted to use external memory on opening the app,  nothing populated in search box.  Nexus 5"
2014,1,Massive area for improvement. Time after time stale prices are shown which leads to disappointment when clicking through to booking website.
2014,5,This app saved me hundreds on tickets to Europe.  Very convenient and user friendly.
2014,1,Can't even start the application because it says I don't have enough free space... On a Nexus 4 with 5gb free
2014,5,Great app and great deals. Best price out there!
2014,4,Use it every time I need a flight. Never realized how cheap traveling could be until I started using sky scanner.
2014,5,Love this app!  Very helpful when I'm trying to decide when to take my vacation time off so I can match my time off to the cheapest flights.
2014,2,The app no longer let's me change the currency to AUS Australian. Seems to be stuck on GBP.
2014,5,Easy to book a flight thru. Great app. Gets u the lowest prices!!
2014,3,"I like sky scanner but it blatantly lies, telling me there are direct flights, then proceeds to give me only non direct."
2014,4,I love not having to input the info for the flights I need just a tap away to find great prices with out charges.
2014,5,There is no such app somewhere else. Quit looking. Rest assured you've found the best one.
2014,5,"Amazing app, amazing service!!! Really love it! And not mention they are in Edinburgh which is a beautiful city!!!"
2014,1,Great app hope art will be supported soon. Keep saying I have insufficient memory.
2014,5,A Friend recommended me this app. Very happy with it. Very easy to use
2014,3,But Quantas airlines timing and pricing were not included.... Include Quantas I will give 5 stars ..
2014,1,Once I book ticket simply deducted ¬£ 2 and showing booking ticket not available.I didn't get any details by mail
2014,2,"Great selection of flights, really  useful visual planners and calendars .... it just ""stops working"" and closes every 5mins"
2014,2,No exit button? Why? So cannot exit from the spp till you press on home key.  Pls. Fix it.
2014,4,ART is killing the app when used instead of on Dalvik on Nexus 5. Please fix this essential app for us asap.
2014,1,You can find out more chip rate from individual website.  Just give some time.
2014,4,"Pretty nice app for comparing flight times, airlines and airports.  Used it a few times for last minute flights."
2014,4,"It's more than 2 weeks that the app is not working, please fix it.  Before was a very good app"
2014,1,Doesn't find airports. Tried six different airport codes and multiple cities and got no results
2014,1,Insufficient external and internal storage.  And it says I have 19.100Mb. Using nexus 5
2014,4,"As far as I can tell, it is pretty accurate. Some times would state prices that can't be found, at least by me."
2014,3,"It seems to miss out budjet airlines like Malindo, which has flights everyday from Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur."
2014,3,"Try STN - HEL, fastest would be STN - DUS - HEL with AirBerlin + FinnAir! And not via Copenhagen!"
2014,3,"Using ART, the app fails miserably. Please fix!"
2014,4,I use this app for all my holidays. Whether its a beach holiday or a city break.
2014,5,"Best travel app period, well actually its the best flight search service in general. Always the cheapest and very easy to use."
2014,3,Would be better if you could mix up the different flights to get better times of day easy.
2014,5,I did my own follow up research and this app came within a few dollars when I went to the individual airline website.  I trust this app completely.
2014,5,Good app. Very useful for me. Plz try it
2014,3,It is a gud app but Im having  difficulties in downloading it stops every moment pls fix dat
2014,3,"As stated by others, won't work on 4.4 with ART. A shame, as it's the only app not working."
2014,1,Pls fix the app...as I'm using galaxy note 8.0 and I can't even install it...pls fix it
2014,4,"One of my best,  I wish they have option of flexible date to compare prices on different dates"
2014,4,"Sangat membantu untuk cari tiket pesawat, tetapi pesawat domestik harus di tambah terutama buat antar pulau dan kota2 di indonesia"
2014,4,This app comes handy when  i need to look for cheap flight but there were some errors that is quite disappointing
2014,4,Though some budget airlines are missing. Still great app
2014,1,"This app is shire doesn't work at all, don't waste your time!!"
2014,4,It's good but doesn't include an option to apply for the Balearic Islands discount.
2014,4,I will give ot a 5 stars if they have notification for discount on specific flights
2014,4,I like it......they should readjust it so that you can change your destination easier
2014,5,Useful in finding the best prices and which sites have them. So far has provided me the lowest rates around
2014,3,It's annoying that you don't have the One way option
2014,5,"5 star, no doubt. Finds flights you wouldn't know to search for and alternatives at amazing princes :-)"
2014,5,A monkey could use this.  Great ui.
2014,5,Great value  Dont think so dohhh.... Rip off
2014,5,"Gyoued I'm not speaking any other language, I know English! I ain't weird"
2014,4,Good Service but I prefer companies that have all inclusive in the price and I hate the add on's system
2014,1,The search option doesn't show the cities which you are searching.
2014,4,Could do with some of the features the website has but overall a great app.
2014,5,"Very helpful app, but currently does not work with ART on my Nexus 4. Pls fix it!"
2014,5,Great way to check out flight costs.  Keep up the good work.
2014,4,It gives a reasonable live costing of different airlines saving heaps of my time
2014,3,It's great but choosing dates after giving departure and return dates is a bit tiring
2014,5,Had no problems using this app.  Sadly as more use it access to the bargains will diminish.
2014,4,"Good app, can browse all the flights under one roof."
2016,1,not a single person like the new updated version please get back the old version
2014,4,"Even if I still have to fly, this is the best way to find cheap flights"
2014,1,App doesn't work because it doesn't detect available internal memory.
2014,4,"But the only defect is the multiple distinction trip planning which is missing here,  I hope to see it soon"
2014,4,Its nice...but it will nicer if amount r in country currency
2014,5,Love not having to search a zillion different sites!! Have not had any problems so still happy!
2014,2,Great on my PC only - wish it would work on my phone as well.
2014,4,This aps is good but they have to maintain to up date about their prices
2014,4,Would like to suggest to have option of multi city search for towards and return flights.

So far it sounds like it is a KitKat incompatibility and nothing to do with my specific phone.    I have submitted a bug report.  Please fix this, thanks."
2013,2,"I had voted 5 stars for this app (loved the 'anywhere' option the calendar view), but after the latest updates I have to change my mind. search results are not as accurate anymore, Ryanair and other low cost options are often missing and the prices in the calendar view often do not correspond to the prices found with a regular search for the same day. Please fix these issues, this was one of my absolute favorite apps!!"
2014,2,The app works great. But it has a hard time with dollar conversion. We bought our tickets and sky scanner said it was one price in U.S. dollars and then it turns out it was really in euros so we got socked an extra $200. So pay close attention to your bill.
2014,2,"I have just used the app to buy 4 return tickets from London to Geneva. No indication on the app that the tickets offered are not allowed hold luggage. ¬£500 for the tickets through Skyscanner, ¬£250 charge from the airline to allow hold luggage. Devious stuff!   Skyscanner can you set up a means to allow users to compare fares with standard terms, not just price. Can you do this early in the booking life cycle so we don't waste time looking at fares that are useless for our needs.  I am sure I am not the only user you have to be duped by assuming that luggage is normal for travelling."
2013,1,Been using for a year until last update. Doesn't work now. Please fix this using on Android jellybean. Cant select dates or destination city. Keeps changing them once selected.  Filled out feedback form and sent screen shots. No update yet.
2014,1,"This review is more of Skyscanner as service than the app. It used to be good. It would search globally on all the airlines and get you the cheapest price. Not anymore. At least in Asia, you are way better off without this page/app. It charges very often 50 or 100‚Ç¨ more than the price offered in main airline websites (not third party agencies, but the official airline website). In short: Their prices suck."
2014,5,"With a tight budget and a whole family needing to fly back and for a lot, this app makes it so easy to find the cheapest flights all the time. I set up two searchs, for different airports or with different dates and i save it to my home screen on my phone. So with just a tap of my finger i can get the best flight deal possible and even buy tickets right then and there if the deal is good enough. This app is great!"
2014,2,"I used to like to use the ""Any day"" searches to find cheap flights home within in the next couple months, but barely anything shows up anymore. There's flights for the ""empty"" days when I click on them, I just wish the app grabbed all of the flights. Wouldn't even mind if it took a while with a progress bar. Also needs a refresh results button."
2014,1,"I know for sure there are plenty of dirdct flights from Manchester to Fuerteventura. This app couldn't source  any direct flights at all and only came up with two airlines flying to the resort! UNINSTALLED! Although it was easy to use,  but pretty pointless if you don't get any results......"
2014,4,"Great app, love the idea.  Not sure why it doesn't show prices for all of the dates I've looked up in the graph.  Also only works on Kit Kat if you use Dalvik"
2014,2,"Not only I found cheaper flights myself, but the cheapest flights sky scanner found me, all were double the price, with more than 2 stops, plus over 13 hrs. I found flights half the price, 1 stop and 4 hours utmost. Add Norwegian air + accomodation in your list and I may consider re-downloading and updating  my rate."
2014,1,"Just downloaded this app, when trying to search for flights I just get no results. Really? There is not a single flight from Pheonix to New York memorial day weekend? Did not make a good first impression so I'm just uninstalling.  Been on my tablet less than 10 minutes. Developers, you might wanna fix this."
2013,5,"This app actually is easier to use than the website, and it blows kayak out of the water. My only complaint would be that the airlines will have unexpected fees (like Norwegian Airline's fee to check a bag and have a meal on an international flight, wth?), but that's not sky scanner's fault. Very happy with this app. BTW, I'm using a Nexus 5."
2014,4,I just installed this on a Samsung Note 10.1 2014 running Jellybean 4.3 and it won't allow me to change the currency to US dollars. Its stuck on GBP despite changing the currency in the settings. Note that I have it installed on my iPad and works fine.
2013,5,Great little app. Easy to setup and it just saved my group $1000 on our holiday. I wouldn't have seen the deal I got without this app.
2013,2,Keeps removing inputted data as you input dates for outward and return flights. Momo20 android 4.1.2. Must be bug cos it worked fine 2 months ago.
2014,2,"Prices between screens don't add up. The correct price in Polish Zlotys is shown, only later to be replaced with the price in GBP, but with the ""z≈Ç"" currency specifier.   Also not all currencies have the specifier in front of the number."
2014,1,On my old samsung there were no problems and I used it a lot. But now it is not working for the huawei device at all. If you could update it that would be perfect! I miss this application.
2014,5,This is the best app or website I've used for booking flights. It shows you the different dates and prices for flights on a graph which makes it really easy to plan the trip at the right time and cost. Thanks SkyScanner!
2014,1,"I would love to give a good rating to this app, but you can't possibly rate an app that won't even install. I've tried it multiple times and each time it downloads to 100% and then freezes. It will not install"
2014,5,This app is the best by far for cheap flights. The best thing is its user friendly and  easy to use. Another great thing is you dont need the latest phone or be a genius.  I recommend this app for all You flight seekers. AAAA+++
2013,5,"I love skyscanner. It is one of the few engines that let's you search from a destination to ""everywhere,"" and it has great calendar feature, that let's you see when it would be cheapest to fly. In a word, amazing."
2014,2,The description of the app offers way more features than the actual app has. The Anytime option didn't work for me. It didn't show anything in the graphs.
2014,3,"Still waiting on KitKat compatibility with libart. ""Do not keep activities"" is not selected. Great app and service before os update."
2014,4,Glad to have found this app! Great way to check cheap flights. One peeve though is that it doesnt seem all airlines are available. :(
2013,5,Easily the best flight comparison out there. Needs the iOs versions 'explore' feature though. Many excellent holidays had so far.
2014,2,Hi! I'm using the new runtime environment of android called ART instead of Dalvik. I'd love you could add compatibility for it! Great app
2014,2,Terrible app. Didnt remember anything and every time i change one setting (ie return day) it forgot all other settings.  Uninstall.
2013,5,"Brilliant Accurate Very Usefull app. If your a frequent traveller, this could save you quite a bit of cash. Many thanks from me to the developers."
2013,2,Was great until last update the dates default to nothing selected and I cant search flights. I travel lots and used this app all the time. Ill have to use expedia from now on.
2014,1,"Tried multiple searches for a simple direct flight and no results every time. Changed dates, departure a return, still no worky. Waste of time, use the internet instead."
2014,5,"App is a life saver but no longer works with update need fix ASAP. Nexus 4 with 4.4.2 update nothing in search box. App always gets the cheapest flights, clean interface easy to navigate"
2014,2,"Come on guys. I have 230 apps. Only 2 don't work with ART this one and a well known supermarket.   Enough excuses, can't be that hard to fix."
2016,5,I am a traveller i used the website a lot and this app is just as easy to use. I have just booked flights to lapland and everything has gone through with no dramas. I love it.
2013,5,"Being able to search one-ways, open ended country to country helped me hack a great itinerary of single leg flights on budget airlines. Saved me $800 vs standard round trip fare."
2013,3,"Does not support multi-city flights (e.g. if you want to arrive at a different city than you depart). The user interface is really smooth and easy to use, however."
2014,1,"Won't find any airports or cities so is pointless.  Tried to use the temporary fix posted, but now it says I don't have enough room on my device (despite there being nearly 1 gb free)"
2014,4,Great but can't figure out how to search one way. Could be option to edit search rather than start a new one.	Great but can't figure out how to search one way. Could be option to edit search rather than start a new one.
2013,5,App is very efficient and nice looking compared to other apps I tried. Easy to use too. Found very cheap plane tickets. Thanks!
2014,3,"when I enter departure, arrival, number of people, ....  Update: The workaround works so far. But I am back from vacation now.."
2014,3,It worked great when I first got it but now I can't use it. It force closes on me all the time.  Can't check any other flights
2014,1,"Maybe it's because I am using ART, but the app keeps telling me that needs 30MB, while I have 7GB free. I can't evaluate the functionalities"
2014,5,Love this app!‚ô• I have it for a long time... easy to use and you can directly book. Also I love the layout.
2014,1,If i wanted to go ANYWHERE... This would be the perfect app. But I don't. I have to be in one place and it says there is NO flights headed there. hmmmm.
2014,5,"I'm impressed with this app and would actually pay money for it... Works fast,  saves searches."
2013,2,"I like this app, but please update for Airport : KualaNamu Medan, Indonesia. I cant find it... :("
2014,5,Very well done.. Only problem when u want to buy tickets it is forwarding you to third party web sites. Try to improve and we will buy tickets direct from this app.
2013,5,"This app has made me want to travel again. Eliminating the stress of manually searching every airline site, and comparing prices. This does it all in one go! Warmly recomended."
2014,5,"Never have I found an app so on target for what I was looking for. I won a vacation but it does not include airfare so it was up to me to find the cheapest time of year to go. This app is simple, efficient, and useful. Perfectly executed."
2014,5,Very easy to use and gives a wide range of products. Even if you are an infrequent traveller this app could save you loads of money. Gives a better range of products than last minute and Expedia put together.
2013,5,"Amazing app... Saved me loads of money till date, at ease while from home as well as incredible when I am on the road...	Once saved 200 pounds plus when Ryan air spoiled my holiday by an incredibly delayed flight..."
2014,5,One of my favourite apps. So powerful. Plus fast and easy to use. Extremely useful when trying to find flights from different UK airports that will at a similar time.
2013,1,All search results coming up empty with possible destinations just listed in alphabetical order. Needs fixing quick or I'll have to uninstall and use other apps
2013,5,I use the widget all the time to keep an eye on best prices available whenever I am considering traveling.  It does a terrific job.
2014,2,Won't show any airports on Nexus 5. Was awesome till update! Get it sorted!
2014,3,"Love everything about this site online but having a frustrating issue with the app. I have set my search in euro, prices come up in euro but when I go to the connecting site the price is in pounds."
2014,5,Great to have on the phone. Very handy and convenient. Works really well.
2013,4,"Ease of use, good deals, just right. One suggestion is make more compatible with 3g"
2013,5,"So easy to use. Remembers your requirements so you don't have to start from scratch every time, also easy to swap dates and prefernces quickly. The best I have tried.	.Brilliant, so easy."
2013,5,"Skyscanner is quick, easy, clear, concise and the best way to find what generally are, the cheapest flights you'll find on line. I wouldn't be without it."
2014,5,"I always use the app for all my flight checks, and it brings the best options. Very simple user interface and results display"
2013,4,Thanks
2013,5,I found no flaws the searching or purchasing when i recently used it to buy my son's airline ticket to come home for Christmas! Lots of airlines and flights to choose from:)
2014,4,"This minght  be most useful app to search flights. One comment, if we can filter by inter-change stop, that would be great."
2013,5,Very good app. Easy to use & saved me money on fares. I cannot undestand why pea-brained people whinge about free apps. ...they really should get out more....
2014,5,"Easy to handle, great view on flight schedule, great filter option.  Just great!"
2014,5,Very functional and delivers the best prices. Multi-stop flight feature would be an excellent extra!

2014,4,Not all 100% available options are displayed but most are there.

2014,5,"One of my favorite apps, love it. Works perfectly on all of my phones."
2013,5,"Saved me from wasting alot time browsing the net, shoping for the best deals Thank you"
2014,1,"Looks like a great app, but when you actually go to book a flight, the price is never the same as shown in the original search. Uninstalling."
2013,1,Impossible to book at low advertise price. Cost hundred's of dollars more when you try to book. Garbage and a waste of time.

2014,5,"Great app!  I'm now using the Nexus 5.  The app doesn't work  when using Art,  but it continues to work perfectly using Dalvik."

2013,4,"I like the one-stop list of flight options across multiple airlines. I like the filter options. Everything seems to work as designed.  Here's a short list of wishes that would make this even better:  - Include a filter option to select arrival times (currently, it only allows selection on departure times.) - Include an ""email results"" option to share results with potential travel companions.  For the most part, I use this to see my options and then call our company's travel agent to book my flight. Once, I made a choice to fly into an airport that wasn't ideal because the best airport only had very expensive options. When I called my travel agent, she found a great price at the good airport that wasn't shown in this app. It was a flight between UT and CA and was a difference of about $350. It made me a bit cautious about relying wholely on this app for ""best prices""."
2013,2,"First off app is really good, love it. Easy to use. There is a alternative way of viewing the results which I found works best on finding cheapest day to fly.    Second make sure your solid on your dates. I picked the wrong return date with their insurance. Called to get it changed. Their rep. Said it would cost a minimum of 250 to change it, mind you my ticket was only 120 round trip. He said I would either pay that and get reimbursed by insurance or buy a 1 way on the correct day."
2013,1,"This app only finds prices but you can't just trust the sites that post them!  The first few times I used this I was perfectly happy with the results. flight picked, reserved, paid on the airlines site and ticket in about 5 to 10 minutes.  The last reservation which was a repeat of the same one last month turned into a nightmare.  took 4 days to get ticket! This app sent me over to another flight network which took my information and credit card. did not transfer me to the airline to finish the transaction then sent an email that it would take up to 2 days to get my ticket, no mention of seat assignment. 24 hrs later i get an E-ticket which the airline said was no good. the booking site was unreachable by email or phone and they claim 24/7 service which is a lie. 2hrs on hold, never picked up.  got an automated email later that they got my email but would take up to 3 business days to respond. still  no idea where my ticket or money went.  had to call the airlines customer service and after 15 minutes of searching they found my reservation unfinished, issued a correct confirmation number and  a real ticket and set my seat number.  Will never use that flight network again!"
2013,1,Your app appears to scan latest deals... But it's nonsense. I tried booking a flight several times now... And it say those flights are not available when it takes me to the website in order to buy. Yet the same flight remains on app search results as an option.
2013,1,"the concept of the app itself is good,but this app is completely useless and is only a waste of time...why do I say so? I wonder if any of those5star reviewers ever tried to proceed all the way to booking...especially using""date bars""to select desired flight dates based on the prices it shows...-that's a complete crap: once u do all the searching&sellecting,the actual prices that will pop-up are completely different(read: a lot higher) than those given to u by the app... Try momondo - simply works better..."
2013,4,"A great app, nothing beats Skyscanner when it comes to cheap airfare. The website is more comprehensive, would be good to see additional features in the app in the future but very useable as it is. Personally, I find it annoying that the app is titled 'flights' in the menu, I have it set alphabetically and I'm looking for Skyscanner. Minor minor thing though."
2013,1,"Wow, this app is rubbish. So far I've had to scroll through every combination of outward and return rather than picking each individually. And after all that, the price on the list is not the actual price. Everything it can do wrong, it does wrong. Did the work experience kid design this? Even the comment section doesn't work. Jesus Christ."
2013,4,It is a useful app and reliable and shows you all available air ways even domestic flight but you can't proceed the booking from the apps (I can't open the web). I think it need integration between the apps and the airways website so you can finish off your booking easily.    I am using Samsung galaxy note 2
2013,4,"One point a lot of non connecting tickets, which require a risky change between two bookings, come up e.g changing planes at Ryanair hubs. This is great and can save some money, but obviously isn't for everybody and it would be great if there was an option to filtering out these results if desired.  Great app tho, and opens up new flying options"
2013,2,I used this app previously and it was excellent not until today. When I ran my saved searches it always prompted me that I am not connected to the internet. I am certain im connected coz I can browse websites and access google store. Please advise or check. Thanks.
2013,2,"The widget had been working fine for me, but now it just shows no results for two cities where I know there are direct flights between them.    The skyscanner site works fine.   The widget seems broke."
2013,1,BEware. Used application to find cheapest flight. Skyscanner sends you to faregeek. You book through fare geek and you put in cc# you try and select seats and yiu cant but worse than that there was nothing said about baggage fees. We print ticket and get frontiers tickets (you don't know until now who your flying with). Now we show up and we ended up paying $50 eavh for carryon each way. I could have booked through airline cheaper
2013,1,I have purshased tickets using this app and the agent company faregeek charged me extra amount on my credit card almost $230 when I called them they said it was a glitch in the system and will refund me that amount but they never did it. Also I saw fees of $52 on each ticket on my statement for skylink which I don't know what is that for? The credit card company doesn't know why they charged me this fees? Sounds like phishy or scam. The credit card company have opened dispute case file for investigation.
2013,3,"The airport in Medan has been moved to Kualanamu International Airport (KNO). And most of the airlines have changed the airport code in their databases to KNO. it'll be a big help for us in Medan if you guys update the app. Other than that, it's a great app. Thanks in advance."
2013,5,"As one who travel often, I am always looking for ways to make my task of finding cheap and great flights. I have experimented with other apps, but now that I found Skyscanner I am very happy.   It has a huge variety of flights all over the world; it is fast, it is accurate, and it finds the greatest price for you. You can trust Skyscanner; it will make you happy because it is effective, reliable, and fast."
2016,2,"The new fancy looking update of the app unfortunately forgets the basics, meaning it takes a series of random taps before you get to the simple flight search option. It's a bit of a mess unfortunately and is no use to me now so I've had to delete it."
2013,4,"The best part about this app?  you don't need to have a destination or date.  if the result could be viewed in calendar form & the bar graph results worked better, 5 Stars."
2013,4,"You have to play a lil bit with it to get the best prices, like filtering options.  I think its great if you have flexible travel dates.  Also it includes nearby airports which gives you more options. Very satisfied!"
2014,1,"App just doesn't work, updated with KitKat.  Not happy there is no external sd card I think.  Used developer option but searches didn't work after that, although app opened."
2017,1,"Terrible app. Can't set range of travel dates, filter options minimal, can only sort in one direction, didn't find several flights that Kayak did. Went back to browser search."
2013,5,"Avg anti virus flags this as malware so uninstalled it.  In response to the reply received from my rateing, I csn confirm that I have reinstalled this app and completed a full AVG anti virus scan with no alerts on completion.  Great app and thanks to creators for contacting Grisoft with regards false positive detection."
2013,1,"Sure, this app looks nice and it's easy to use, but the prices are a scam. Don't believe me?  Try this...MSP to MCO, round trip. It comes back with 366. But there are NO tickets for that price.  You select it and first you find out its 665 to get to MCO, and another 895 to get home. Actual price 1560 PER PERSON. this is a waste of your time...don't bother."
2013,4,This app is so easy to use and brilliant for finding cheap flights! My only problem is that the prices displayed are only representative so actual prices are often slightly more but not by much. Still so much easier to use and find good deals than other sites etc!
2013,2,Was excited when I saw prices and the way u can see prices on all callendar dates. I went to book a flight to Thailand from Auckland nz at $897 and i realized it was in AUSD NOT NZD. So when i was abou to check out the tottal was up to $1149.  There is also no way to change currency.
2013,4,"Smart app. Good widget that monitors the flights your looking for, so you can see when their at their cheapest.   Bad point is you can only search for single destination flights. No multiple destination flight searches."
2013,1,"The prices are good and there its a great deal of flexibility in terms of travel dates but when its time to book the flight, it can never be found. Also there its no one at the other end of the customer service line. Its good on paper! Disappointed."
2014,4,I love the ease of searching and being able to modify criteria. I would love it more if I could set up an alert with my time frame (given flexibility of +/- specified days) and be notified when prices drop. That would make this app 5 stars.
2013,4,Convenient to search cheap flights. But maybe can include a table where u can see which days have the cheapest rates. And also not complete list of airlines....some airlines which are not included in this app are cheaper
2013,5,"The app is easy to navigate. It's not the most advanced UI, but certainly does the trick. Finding good fares on here saves plenty of time."
2013,1,I had the itinerary on the screen and when clicking individually to each site to book the flights the prices and the time did not match at all! I have wasted money in the bookings and now I have to stay overnught waiting for a connection flight. DONT USE THE APP UNLESS YOU CHECK IT SEPARATELY FROM THE COMPANIES FIRST.... SO TOTAL WASTE OF TIME
2013,4,"An appreciative, user-friendly app that makes your flight search easy n fast. Reliability yet to decide.  So above average.	An appreciative, user-friendly app that makes your flight search easy n fast. Reliability yet to decide.  So above average."
2013,5,So many flexible options. Many connections and countries to choose from. Flexible calender. Try it.  I'm sure you will like it like I did. No complaints.
2013,3,It's good to know where your local airport flies to and where you can get to your destination from but it's not always precise in its information. For instance you request direct flights only and it seems to give you them till you delve deeper to find there are stopovers thus wasting your time. Still it had its uses.
2013,1,"Worked yesterday, now search doesn't work. The app says that internet connection is required, even though I am connected. Please fix asap!"
2013,4,"Very good, especially since it's free. Might be my phone, but crashes a lot; gets right back up, though. Add ""tickets left"" feat and it'll be perfect."
2013,2,When  you select the flight you want to book it then takes you to a third party website where invariably the flight you chose isn't available. Then there is an option to phone where you can spend 20 mins before they try to sell you a more expensive flight
2013,4,"I love this app and use it all the time to get an idea of flight costs. Works well, but website better because it is able to give you suggestions for cheaper flights from other airports and destinations."
2013,1,The new update is totally pathetic... whenever i search ne thing it always shows no connection... I  was loving it before but now m very dissapointed
2013,4,Really nice app. Especially like the functionality that allows you to search for the cheapest flight over time. Would get 5 stars but often the price increases dramatically when you click through to your chosen flight which obviously is no good!
2013,2,"This app has some basic drawbacks. No multi-destination ability! It also seems expensive, so they do not have the resources that other site must have."
2013,5,"The cheapest flights! Quick & easy! The bar graph is perfect for viewing the cheapest days to fly, without having to search each date! Thank you for this app- it has saved me so much time and money!"
2013,3,"Why is it called ""flights"" on the app drawer instead of skyscanner? Makes it hard to find alphabetically when you have a lot of apps in your phone"
2013,5,This app works within seconds as opposed to going ro carious web sites.  It finds deals and no need to keep re-keying location as it remembers. Im smiling
2013,2,"Search for flights, get the price, then once you press book all it does is take you to the airline's website where you have to enter the flight details all over again. Why not transfer the details automatically? Waste of time. Uninstalling."
2013,5,I'm very impressed with this app and the charts for cost per date is extremely usefull to find the cheapest flights. Wish there was currency choice and phone numbers specific to current country.
2013,2,"It wont list ANY flights to Cuba from Canada, but many flights available on other sites. For a sso called 'comprehensive' flight app it fails if it censors search results. Canada is NOT the Usa."
2013,3,"hi there, could you please fix airport medan, Indonesia. since it move, from Polonia (MES) to Kuala Namu (KNO). we cannot get any ticket information because skyscanner only identify medan as MES. thx. I'll rate 5 stars after u fix it :)"
2013,5,Easy-to-use. Searches multiple airlines.  I really like the widget that allows you to search daily for the best flight and price.
2013,4,Works well on android tablet and phone. Interface could do with being a bit more user friendly re: display of availability.
2013,5,"Nice work, i am really grateful to the programmers and God for giving an opportunity to be a partaker in the utilizing this great tech work. Thank you... God bless and more wisdom."
2013,3,Doesn't automatically update prices after search finds more expensive price.. A little disingenuous as a route to drive traffic
2013,1,"Doesn't give options for flights from Cebu Pacific and Tigerair. Only offered flights from Philippine Airlines, PAL Express, Zestair."
2013,4,"Especially useful for single flights, easy to use. Prices are not always accurate though so need to double check. Overall really good app."
2014,4,"Out of the price-checker apps I've encountered, Skyscanner is by far the easiest to use. Runs seamlessly on my One"
2013,5,Very easy to use. Love that you can overview options per days together. As a person who travels often it's a perfect app.
2013,5,"Saves so much time , especially looking for Ryanair flights, don't have to use their ridiculous web site until I need to book. Thank you so much."
2013,2,It would not show me flights that were available at airline site that were half the price of ones I found at US Airways that were even nonstop.  Removing   this now.
2013,5,"This, iMO has to be the most easiest and most accurate app for flights I've used so far. I've also used it to book flights, and have to say that the price on screen was the price I paid apart from a small fee to pay by credit card rather than debit card,( but that was the airline charging for using c/card which a lot of companies do now, not s/scanner charging).so, have to say, so far so good."
2013,4,"Sometimes when we are put thru to the booking of chosen flights, the actual flighttimes offered are different - usually less convenient! I guess it is not Skyscanner responsability but it is disappointing! Anyway a superb app!"
2013,5,Best app. Better than all others.  Pls add option. For setting own route Airports to connect via. And additional destinations.
2013,5,"Most amazing, and fantastic and fun way to find the cheapest AND most convenient flights for you!! Must be a top 10 android app!! Thank you Devs Dream Team!! ;)"
2013,4,"Handy for quick checking but full site gives more ""flexibility"" options to find right deals,would be nice to see here."
2013,4,I think if multy city option is also added than this app worth 5 stars all the way.       .
2013,4,"Works very well, except it doesn't reflect prices real-time. So when u see the details, u will then see the latest prices"
2013,5,Very helpful. It makes me much easier to get the info I want. User friendly features are one of other things that I like. Great!
2013,4,One of the most useful tool/apps used to plan my travels.... Thanks for this great apps & ensure to upkeep it always....
2013,4,"Very helpful and clear application. Misses one feature: flexibility suggestions which the website has, but the app hasn't."
2013,4,The app is average ... but the sheer effectiveness of the basic site allows for 4 stars. Work on the app is required to allow for more adaptable and navigatable settings and options.
2013,5,"For years, I have complained to my husband when planning trips. I would be searching countless airlines on different windows, while attempting to coordinate lodging. With Sky scanner, I can search literally every airline. I can even search for everywhere to see where the cheapest location for the dates I have to travel are going to be. Makes planning so much easier! Never again will I waste days out of my life planning!"
2013,5,"There are many apps that perform the same function as this one, but this one is sooo much more intuitive! Thank you, Developers!"
2013,4,"When searching around for cheapest flights, prices go a bit up when going back to old destinations. Clear cookies on phone to get lower fair.."
2013,5,"So much utility, very simple and clean interface, wish they would update with hotel+car booking options but SO GOOD!!"
2013,4,"In this AAP Major advantage is, you can get best air fair in one site itself.    thank you."
2014,4,This app is very convenient and you can check flights faster with only a few clicks. It lets you compare fares easier too. Great app!
2013,5,"Very easy to use app, search es for cheapest flight and sends you to website to book it. A handy option is that it tells you which sites are optimized for mobile which is nice!"
2013,4,Great app that alerts you of great deals straight to your home page or shortcut. Will be even better if prices can be stored offline for later review.
2013,5,Makes booking flights a lot easier and avoids over paying.  Handy for routing via places although could do with more options when flying budget airlines with no guarantee transfers.
2013,5,I can't wait to see the next deals. This site is great for planning getaways..I'm telling all my family and friends about this...
2013,5,"I've been using skyscanner for the past couple of years and have booked all of my flights with them.  I recommend it to anyone looking for the best airfare.  I also love that I can look for flights in different countries, ie, Paris to Marseille."
2013,5,I love this app. I've got many great deals using this. Thank you for making very simple and easy to use.
2013,5,Gives me a good lot of options to choose from and everything at one place. UI is also very user friendly and good. One of the perfect mobile apps for scouting for flights
2013,5,"Very user friendly, fast n important in today's life for people who fly regularly."
2013,5,"great app .. thank you  I miss + - 3 days option, this way it would be more easy to find better prices.."
2013,5,Excellent application.  Very user friendly.  Thanks for making flight search so easy!
2013,5,Apps works pretty well. Supports all countries. Flexible and provides easy way to choose cheaper air tickets
2013,5,Love the user experience. Just wish it would allow me to do multi hop bookings and additional currency support.
2013,5,I have a lucky case where all 3 airlines which fly to my favourite destination are signed up to skyscanner. All the possible flight combinations for the best deal are at my fingertips thanks to them.
2013,5,The best app to get the best deal for your flight. No partiality towards airlines....  genuine to customers
2013,5,The greatest simple as. Thank you for playing a part in my dreams coming true with your amazing prices.
2013,4,"Sometimes it fails to find any results even though I am sure i it found them previously. Wish there was integration with rail, bus, coach and ferry services as I the airport I may be able to get a service to may not actually be in the right town or city."
2013,5,it is good.  if you like to save money and do it your self. I like it.
2013,5,Thanks for providing such a great app. Travelling is so much easier. Waiting for the multiple destination option.
2013,5,Give 5 star but it deserves 100 I try to buy cheap flights. Found on this app fares or more expensive than company website like if I buy tickets from Emirates will  cost 823‚Ç¨and this app offer 1185‚Ç¨ Sorry this app deserve 400+
2013,5,"We used this app extensively on Samsung tablet & I Samsung note I while travelling for 6 months in north, central & south America. Great app works perfectly."
2013,5,"I like this application, it works fast and has many great deals. Dear SkyScanner, please add Spring Airlines to airlines list!^-^"
2013,5,"I work with airlines ecommerce and UX, and I'd like to day this is one of the best apps I've seen for flight search. Really well executed. Kudos to the team."
2013,1,Just downloaded for the first time from the play store and every time I search flights it tells me I have an old app and to update it. But no update is available...pls fix I use the website every time I travel.
2013,5,This app exceeded my expectations.  It's even better than most websites.  Huge thanks to the developers and  designers
2013,2,Not possible to change valuta.. thats enough to vote this app down!.. it works fast and are stable.
2013,2,Was working just fine for  a few  weeks now when I search for fights between dfw and fll which I was able to do before now it gives me an error saying cannot search between the airports I chose...
2013,2,Can't enlarge screen to enter personal details/payment info when booking. No good if using phone!!
2013,4,In all a good app to compare fights and prices. Sometimes it doesn't show the latest price. I usually use it to see if fares change and if flights are still available.
2013,1,"App doesn't work, says no internet connection. Even when I am connected to the Internet. Please fix this issue ASAP."
2013,4,Don't update as this usually has the tendency to sooil great working apps.
2013,4,"Great app, well made and designed. Only fault is the incorrect prices from time to time (or completely unavailable flights still being advertised) but this I assume to be the nature of the system."
2013,4,I'm using it quite extensively and I have to say it's easy and intuitive to use. Thanks people :-)
2013,2,"When you click on the cheap days, it almost always say the prices have been adjusted.... And it's way higher then the prices shown."
2013,5,Love this app! Able to check all flights and prices. Tells me if theres a cheap flight coming up so im able to book right away.
2013,3,"Some great deals come up in the search, very simple to use. Use as guide then search through suggested airlines individu"
2013,4,Super app  Can u add any deals also!!!
2013,5,More filters than most apps. Simple presentation.  Easy to use.  Lots of options and airlines.
2013,2,The layout isn't user friendly nor can you see the total price for return ticket fees.
2013,5,I like that the app remembers my recent searches. Haven't seen a similar feature on the desktop...
2013,5,This really is good and opens  up options I would never have considered or had the time 2 research. Recommended.
2013,5,So amazing that someone finally thought of a really intuitive way to look at tons of flights in a totally customizable and flexible manner. Sometimes I just play with it because it's fun!
2013,5,"Absolutely brilliant app,  the refine search options are amazing so you can find the exact flight that suits!  Cannot recommend this app more."
2013,5,I love this app. Its my first and last check beford i book any flights.  It always saves you money.
2013,5,Great for finding flights. The only thing I use now. Works perfectly on my N7 and GNex.
2013,5,Love that I can search without a set begin or end date. Other apps only give you a small variance around your set dates. With skyscanner I can search and combine different flights/dates to get the cheapest.
2013,4,I am connected to wifi and it says unable to search because no connection. It was okay yesterday. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still not working. :(
2013,4,"Cleanly and quickly finds and presents flight information over all competing major airlines, virtually eliminating the need for multiple searches. Also love the feature to search for entire months at a time!"
2013,5,The best apps...help me to get cheapest flight!   From my galaxy s4
2013,5,"Nice widget, great tool for frequent traveler. Keep up good job."
2013,5,First time I bothered to rate an app... This is class. No messing around 5 or 6 different websites and screens. Just use it to save u time and hasstle
2013,5,This is just an awesome app. This has now become my goto app if I want to look for flights! It supports all the airlines in the Middle East so that's good!
2013,5,Thanks
2013,4,Fantastic it searches a very good deal! Very impressed! Thank you Skyscanner.
2013,1,"Disappointed with this app, every time I find a cheap fare and click on it. ..it disappears and takes me to a more expensive fare!"
2013,4,Helps u to scan d cheapest flights including budget airlines with no additional cost. Hassle-free to book a gateway :-)
2013,5,Typically they produce the best deals. Check different times on different days of the week because airline prices drop certain times / days.
2013,5,this is so good because of how simple and intuitive it is to use compared with anything else ive seen. aswell as the great results.  personally I f *-*-*-g love it.
2013,3,"Hi, pls include Cebu Pacific in airfare scanning for international and local flights coming from the Philippines. Thanks so much."
2013,5,Love skyscanner - it's easy to use and shows exactlt what I'm looking for. Thanks!
2013,4,Super useful app but there's no option for multiple destination booking
2013,3,"This app is a really good starting point to find flights, however it does not show the cheapest price. I have always been able to find cheaper flights on different sites."
2013,4,Would also like to see if other nearby airports would cost less instead of having to enter each one everytime
2013,5,The best app to find a flight around the world and the easiest way to find out the cheapest flight in different airlines or agencies. I love it and I highly recommend this app to be used by all travelers.
2013,5,Very handy tool when looking for bargains and don't have the time to shop one airline at a time.
2013,4,Hi! Guys this is nice and very much useful application so guys go ahead and download it now what are you waiting for l don't think anything else is  better than this.
2013,5,Always gives pretty estimates and wide possibility. A very good help. Thanks
2013,1,It always prompt no enough memory where my phone has lots of space.
2013,4,Great tool to search for the best rates to the desired destinations. Good job!
2013,5,Very accurate and realtime results were fast. Thanks .made life easier	Found nothing wrong on Motorola Photon Q
2013,4,One app I couldn't live without.. User friendly and straight forward.
2013,5,I've been looking for a site - app to do this forever.  I'm a flexible flyer so looking for the best days and cheapest is perfect for me!
2013,5,"Reliable, easy to set and doesn't kill the battery life. Best one I have tried."
2013,4,does not give multi stops option.unless i dont know how to do it. cheers
2013,4,Great app. I only hope that someday the widget could scan more than one departure to destination.
2013,1,Crashes on startup without populating initial screen after last update
2013,5,Easy to use. Great gui.  Always able to find great deals here.
2013,3,Gives a rough idea of the prices. If you can offer links to the websites for booking and accurate prices you will become a must have app
2013,5,Actually works.  Really surprised.  I assumed it would be rubbish like most of these apps.
2013,5,I really love using this app! It works smoothly and never runs slow!
2013,5,Very useful wee app.  It is easy to use and has a good user interface.  Nice to use.
2013,5,"Very usefull, it really works and give you good deals for plane tickets, lots of options."
2013,5,Love how it finds the right flights for me. Real value for money. Thanks developers!!!
2013,5,Perfect for me but would like to support a ad free version for not to much. :-)
2013,3,"Doesn't recognize any city names, so i can't search - no functionality.	As above - 3 stars cause it was great when it worked."
2013,5,This is a very useful app and it has almost everything that is needed. One thing to improve is to provide option to filter to a specific airline.
2013,2,Why when l checked your site for flights air asia did not appear? Air asia fly there daily so when l checked air asia site flights were available at cheaper than your site provided!
2013,5,"I have been using this app for nearly a year and found easy to use, quick, clear and informative. Don't look anywhere else. This is the one."
2013,5,Always gets me the cheapest deals!  Thanks Sky Scanner!   :)
2013,1,I found this app not to be very useful in my initial trial. The app is not very intuitive and doesn't allow you to book directly. It's easier to use Travelocity
2013,4,So easy to use and gives you all the option for flights.. very helpful!!! I love it
2013,2,Fail. The app says all airlines yet Southwest Airlines does not show up. Maybe scared because Southwest fares will always be cheapest. I will stick with Southwest.
2013,5,This is the real deal!! Helped me find the cheapest deals! Got around $1800 savings because of this!
2013,5,I use it daily at work. I work in the airline industry and I constantly check flights to different destinations. So far it has not faul me. Easy to use and interact.
2013,3,"Searched for flight from Cebu to Manila - was amazed didn't show all airlines travelling the route - especially Cebu Pacific, possibly the busiest carrier."
2013,5,Really useful. Comprehensive airline options. Can save time and money with this app.
2013,5,I have downloaded tons of apps for airfare but this is the Greatest app to know worlds' airfare. Thanks to skyscanner
2013,4,App facile e comoda da usare. Purtroppo non troppo affidabile sui prezzi. Spesso i voli alla prima ricerca appaiono pi√π economici di quanto lo siano davvero
2013,5,So easy so accurate so fast. Nothing can beat this app. Thanks to dev.
2013,4,"App is easy to use, but some of the prices are not updated. I still find this app helpful when it comes to finding the cheaper fights."
2013,4,Please clarify why the AVG antivirus classifies it as a malware. Otherwise an excellent app for travel booking.
2013,5,Used this app several times while travelling around Europe.  9 times out of 10 you'll get the best price and it's super easy to use.
2013,5,"It's a flexible program by which you can see at once what dates are cheaper to fly on at a glance. Once I know the best dates, I usually go on a computer to book, simply because its easier to type on a full scale keyboard for me."
2013,2,Why there is no calendar view as you got in your web page.  If you got then it's not working in my Note2.
2013,1,"At the moment,  it doesn't work on Nexus devices as it claims there isn't enough external memory and then complains there isn't enough internal memory when there is.  Cannot search for flights as airports aren't listed"
2013,1,Latest update  gives no results.  On ics.  Shame was my favourite flight search
2013,4,Simple & easy to use. Some better filtering and sorting features would complete it.
2013,5,I use this app almost weekly to dream. But every time I genuinly need to book a flight I use it too. Never had a problem.
2013,3,It is a user friendly app very easy to use but when I click on a flight to book the site it takes me to has a major price difference than what the app shows me.
2013,5,The best flight search engine as it gives you the option to change your flight day much easier than other search engines.
2013,5,Super app . Very usefull. Excellent speed..very user friendly.
2013,5,It looks like the app is doing everything and doing it fine! Thanks for this!
2013,4,Very affective search brings up lots of alternatives. Good user interface.
2013,4,Like dis app alot. Skyscanner rocks.been using them 4 years.
2013,2,app gives one price on bar chart screen the when it searches it increases by about 60%...false information to start off with too get your hopes high.
2013,1,The menu looks easy to use but after when i hit search it keeps saying it require internet connection  yes I am online and still keeps on giving me the same message
2013,1,Where is Southwest? I've done several searches and they never show up. SW is the best airline company.
2013,5,"Great app, simple to use & get destinstion ideas from if you don't know where you want to go. By typing everywhere in the destination space you can search anywhere."
2013,3,"The app is quit good but only one thing,the app should have its own paying system rather than divert me to the flight comp and then start from begining by searching again"
2013,4,"Good app, easy to use. Not too big. Love it to prepare breaks out while at work"
2013,5,"Excellent guys .thanks for creating this app,reliable and user friendly."
2013,5,This app allows you to see pricing and available flights around a chosen date very easy. Making it very easy to save $100's.
2013,3,I like how you can see all the different airlines. But the prices are not so accurate some of the flights you need to be a member to get those prices.
2013,4,"Good app. Does what it says it will, with an easy to use user interface."
2013,1,Shows tickets which not available or transfers with different connection.  I spend hours to find my ticket but bought NON!
2013,1,Shows all the flights on the first page but then won't let me go any further.
2013,5,ive used it for over 3 months. skyscanner is now one click away. great!
2013,5,"Really a good app even gives you cheaper rates than other sites, you can compare the day by day up and down of rates of particular destination, a must have app for frequent traveller."
2013,4,Results well presented. Allows easy sorting n filtering by any field.
2013,4,Always works. The only problem is the app sends you to a new website to pay for tickets
2013,5,"Iv used this loads of times noe, even if some searches are just wishes... Lol"
2013,5,",.a veRy nice app that keep us ontRack on the different pRizes of tickets on eveRy airLine companies, but what i wonder is you onLy have two airLine comp. how about the other companies?"
2013,5,"Fast, simple and accurate deals across the globe. Five stars app."
2013,4,App works good. It gives u best available options on price/airlines.
2013,4,Great that it shows budget airlines although not all. Need to include more budgets.
2013,5,It help me a lot... thanks for this aps. Two thumbs up
2013,5,The app works just as well as the site only easier. Glad to have it!
2013,4,Much faster than the website but gets FOREX wrong. Flights for ¬£44 were only ¬£27 when I paid for them
2013,1,After installing receiving threat aleart of Malware found in this app. Get this removed immediately so we can install this app.
2013,5,Fast and easy to use. Has become my go to place for searching air fares.
2013,5,Good tool to keep track of fluctuating European flights. Fast and easy to use.
2013,5,Used this site while traveling around Europe on the cheap. Love the app! Super easy and intuitive.
2013,5,I use this app to help my boss book her business travel. It is quick and better than expedia.
2013,4,"It shows a warning to check my Internet settings but my connection is ok, working good without any proxy."
2013,5,very good app to buy air ticket. just a few easy steps and ready to go. i love it so much.
2013,3,Now many changes in flights and timing so need updates will usefull to users
2013,5,Never spoil this excellent application with any unnecessary updates...
2013,1,All Ways Showing Wrong information!  is only Showing on Spanish Language!! How we change language to English!?
2013,5,"After finding Skyscanner I always wonder why do the other apps exist, when they have nothing more to offer!"
2013,4,Best app in market. Only improvement it need is to add multi destination in flight search. Otherwise it's unbeatable.
2013,4,Excellent app. Comprehensive overview of every flight in the world. Use it all the time.
2013,5,Great app! Thanks

2013,5,Extremely easy. Compares all the airlines at one touch of my screen. Love it! Saved me 200 dollars

2013,5,Easy to use. All around a great program for the task.
2013,5,Really simple to use but has saved me loads of money. Consistently found cheaper flights than my travel agent.

2014,5,Many options. Savings. And easy to book. Perfect !!!

2013,5,Works as I would like. I haven't had any issues.

2013,5,Can't find a better way to find cheaper flights... is the default text in this field but entirely true.

2013,5,"Love how simple this is, and clean the price tracker widget is. Awesome."
2013,5,Its great app. But doesn't give the option to search for the multiple flights

2013,2,"Nothing out there compares Southwest~ which kicks the competition most always-to other airlines. Annoying. Why would I use  this app when I can pull it up quicker on my laptop? NOW, if this compared rates against SW airlines, and I could one stop shop, it would be a unique, AWESOMEEEEE  app!  I will pass til more airlines are added, thanks!"
2013,1,"This app is supposed to allow users the ability to compare flights in order to book cheap, convenient travel, but a quick visit to the websites of the suggested airlines showed many flights not provided by this app that are most often available for a fraction of the suggested price. Furthermore, I searched a flight that had departure and return flights advertised at $98 each, when clicked on I was forwarded to info for a flight costing $1,400 - this happened consistently. Pretty close I guess..."
2013,1,"In comparison to the original releases, I've rated 5 stars, then 3, and now 1 in a years time. The prices are NEVER accurate anymore and only gets your hopes up, and on top of that, I have found that this app sometimes uses third parties, and prices are $10 higher than buying the ticket directly. SHAME!"
2013,5,I like that you can search flight prices for the whole month and not just certain dates making each search far more flexible. I've downloaded many apps like this to try and find better but I can't find better. It would be even better if there was more flexibility with destinations when using connection flights like flying to a different airport on the way home from a destination from the connection airport used going to your final destination. Also there should be an option to mix airlines for journey's.
2013,3,"being able to search for flexible dates and nearby airports is essential to finding the lowest price. this app doesn't give me that option. I do like being able to find the lowest price to ""anywhere""! I will keep it just for that feature."
2013,4,"I'm a frequent traveler and waste many hours combing all the websites for cheapest rate. I was  amazed that this app actually includes all my favorites, includes special deals only listed on airline websites, etc. Saves me the hassle of doing 50 million searches."
2013,3,"Used to love this app, but since the last update the time of day filter doesn't register, even after accepting changes and pressing done. On my device anyway. It's not very efficient."
2013,5,"This app is perfect. I love that I can search for a range of dates from a specific departure city to ""anywhere"" (or vice versa) if I'm not sure where I want to go for vacation. So far, the cheapest prices are here..not on one of the billions of travel sites (which also don't have the open ended search feature). A must have app for travelers!!"
2016,1,Used to be the best app for finding the cheapest deals to everywhere. Is really hard to navigate and can't do what you want any more after update. Gutted.
2013,1,One way option? Multi city option? Adding children?  Where are these basic functions?? There are real alternatives (e.g. Kayak) which this app is just not up to.
2013,1,All flights that u look fir has already been taken. The most annoying app ever. Dont waste your time downloading it. Had to go to flightcentre direct to book my flights..
2013,5,"Plenty of nice and easy-accessible features. App is fast and intuitive. However flight prices differ slightly, data seems to be delayed, not real time."
2013,4,"No comments.  The app is good. It gives the ability to search for flights without determining the exact date of departure and arrival.  Also, it provides an option to check other bookings on different website."
2013,2,"Started out as 2 x $330 fares, with extra charges and bank conversion fees ended up costing $790. Didn't realise I was booking with overseas co until it was completed.  I won't be using again."
2013,4,"Great app, but does not show all options. Sometimes it misses some airlines. I say that because I check myself the missed ones."
2013,4,I really like this app. Its easy to use and has the best deals. Would be great if you had a multidestination option too:)
2013,4,Shows the best n cheapest connectivity using multiple airlines' scheduler.
2013,5,"Great fir finding the best deals. In constant use on my phone, only waiting for the airline ti release schedules."
2013,2,"If you want to book in 10 months forward. There is no ""air asia"". Everybody in asia knows that air asia is the cheapest. I compare it from air asia website there's a flight that is cheaper.."
2013,4,"Good UI, and quick booking site, needing a quick prompt to get to the airports and Android phones, being too sensitive to the touch needs a prompt to not exit the page, or maybe a slight delay."
2013,5,"The UI, functions, triggers, exceptions in the app are far away from being lame. Very nice app from a very very nice developer. It helps many people though, would kindly recommend this to others."
2013,4,Works well and shows general prices quickly. Then you can narrow the  search and flight. Worked well so far
2013,4,Great way to check your flight prices just wish they had a graph of your prices so you can see if it went up/down
2013,5,Identify your local airport and find out where you can get to from it. Then check out the deals. Fantastic tool.
2013,4,"The app is beautifully designed, works fine and fast. Unfortunately, I've got better prices going directly to the agency, so I only use it as a reference."
2013,4,"I could see that in the app there is only air india flight from trivandrum to male but in real there is another flight ""maldivian"" also. hope you would work on it"
2013,5,Nice app dude... Really can scan and provide u the best fare... Very much user friendly....
2013,4,"Great comparison tool. All you need to now about existing airlines and routes, all in one place. This app is fab."
2013,5,I appreciate the app. it is absolutely perfect. now I am able to search a fligh in a sec.it gives all info. covers all the airlines in the world. thank you
2013,1,"I have an HTC one S, and when i search for a flight it says that i must have an internet connection to perform the search. And I have internet connection... Something's wrong with the app"
2013,5,Don't even bother trying anything else. This app will give you all the options available.
2013,1,Has ad banners.  There are better ones that don't.  Also the Iphone version is far superior to this one.
2013,5,One of the best app for online ticket booking (only) via mobile. What I liked the most is the capability to mark favorite the itineraries and view the recent searches.   Would be far better if we could select multiple cities during search.
2013,5,"this is so helpful, being a traveller and a frequent flyer. they find the best deals!! so worth it i love this app"
2013,5,"Interesting feature is that you dont even need to give specific destination, can search everywhere in any country and choose the place based on price"
2013,5,"I've been using this app to find the cheapest, and greatest flights ever. I just love it, it makes my life easier within my budget. I don't usually rate apps, unless they are pretty good or awful, and Skyscanner is just great!"
2013,5,"I have been using this app for at least 2 years since HTC one x, very good app..well done."
2014,1,"Used to love Skyscanner bc it was so quick, convenient, user friendly etc, but since the recent update it is literally the opposite. SUCK SUCK major SUCK"
2013,5,Works great on my Galaxy Note 2. Very quick and thorough in finding available flights. Highly recommended!
2013,5,I used this app to book flights within Europe. I found some great deals but the best thing is it is easy to use.
2013,5,This is how all Android apps should work. Better than many Airlines desktop sites. Well done!
2013,3,Works fine until you try and pay. It opens the browser but doesn't load a page.
2013,1,"This prices this app gives you are lower than the actual cost, it quotes you a a really good price then when comes to actually booking the flight the price goes up. I ended up finding cheaper flights myself without the help of skyscanner."
2013,5,"Really easy to use.  sometimes.I don't know where I want to go, I just know I want to go somewhere.  I select anywhere and anytime and the app lists all the best places to go at the best prices.  Perfect for me"
2013,4,"I used it to find and book a return flight to Paris. Process was easy, flight was cheap and everything went smoothly. Can't ask for more."
2013,5,"The only one of its kind. Easy and cheap! Thank you for the many times I have used you.

   Pppaulp"
2013,5,"Full marks for being intuitive, and bonus marks for the money it saves. This app is a must have for the frequent traveler who funds his own trips."
2013,5,Connects to ALL ticket vendors databases. Start with country to country with anytime travel to get the best price possible.
2013,5,You *need* this app if you are planning on flying anywhere. You can specify dates or you can easy compare prices over a whole month if you are flexible. Definitely a prerequisite for anyone looking for a flight.
2013,1,BS...! You see one price.. after this you being redirected.. and prices goes UP! Same like in website.
2013,4,"Very convenient to use! As for improvement, the price should also state if it's included tax and surcharge"
2013,5,Skyscanner has saved me thousands in the ten years I've used the site. Now I can take it everywhere I go with this great app. To infinity and beyond...!
2013,5,Never seen before deals available with excellent economic price. This app suits the best for me!
2013,5,Really good for booking flights and planning holidays. I wish there were a similar app for hotels and car hire too. Excellent overall and very easy to use!
2013,4,Very simple to use. Currently try to track pricing for two trips and it allows me to bounce back and forth without having to reset it every time.
2013,4,"if the widget search could have filters applied to, it would be perfect. (i need max 1stop filter)"
2013,3,"Its great app,, unless it can give a right price. It often say a low price when i try too book it the price much more higher than the estimation it give"
2013,5,So easy to get results! Is very flexible when entering your own  requirements for searches. I like it and recommend it as probably the only app you'll ever need for it's purpose.
2013,4,But its not direct booking therefore still route to main airline for booking.. u have to key multiple times if u doing many cities
2013,5,"Applikasi yg cocok banget buat yg hobi traveling.. banyak pilihan, cuma tinggal update beberapa penerbangan aja.. Mantap!!"
2013,5,Accurate. Purchased ticket in an emergency with the help of this app. Thank you and keep it up :)
2013,5,Great App I Like It Works Well With My Galaxy S 2 Thank You For The Uppdate Can Not Give You More Than Five Stars Hi
2013,5,"Its a awesome airfare app, comparing many airfare websites to find the cheapest prices around. It never seizes toa amaze me I saved alot of loot using this monster app. Kutosssss. Love It!!!!! :-)"
2013,5,"The greatest service ever, you will save hundreds on flight costs! This app is also very similar to the desktop version!"
2013,4,It doesn't inform you that it could be cheaper to pay in a different currency/with a different billing country. eg I found a flight from Vancouver to London for $600 cheaper when I searched in CAD instead of GBP
2013,5,This app is brilliant and simple I was able to find what I was looking for in seconds and booking it was made even easier thanks Skyscanner!
2013,5,"Great app, really fast  and convenient"
2013,1,For fun I've had it running for over a month on a particular flight:  Hasn't changed at all.  Not one penny.  Bogus app.
2013,5,Just booked my flights to South Africa. So easy to search and find the best deals.
2013,4,Can't find this necessary function.  Loads fast. Seamless.  Joy to use
2013,5,"It always good to know the you move around the places cause you learn, in other words this section is important for me plus friends & family in general, we can check see each other or even make a better planning depending the cash at hand and this applies to which flight fits best this idea is impressing idea."
2013,5,I'm speechless. Everything you want is right here. You should try this. Thanks to the developer an co.
2013,5,Just what I've been looking for. Love it! Works flawlessly
2013,5,"I love this. . I can plan to visit my girl anytime I feel like... really  convenient, no help required. . So cool."
2013,5,I travel a lot and love this app to find the best dates to travel. Easy to use and a must on every phone!
2013,3,Good application to download. I am just not sure where to book..hope it cud offer bigger discounts.
2013,5,"That exelent application!!! Use it more then 2 month. Very good""! Thank a lot"
2013,4,"Works quickly & intuitively. Additional costs, such as tax, are the only missing element."
2013,5,"I love this app. I have purchased tickets using this app only twice, but it is so easy to use that I even use it to check prices when I am curious."
2013,4,The app is great for seeing price trends.  This is very useful for holiday planning.  The only drawback I have found is sometimes there are gaps in the prices.
2013,5,"Great App saves time over using individual web sites and finds you the cheapest rate. Really good if your flexible, love the extended view."
2013,4,It's fast and easy to use. But some rates show cheaper can be more expensive when it move to other parties website.
2013,5,Nice interface. Easy to navigate. Great app!
2013,5,Comes up with all the best options.... Very easy to use and UI
2013,4,It will be the best if this programme can compare multi destination journey. Anyway its already been helpfull to me for getting the idea which airlines I need to compare
2013,5,This app is a money saver. It quickly scans the world for the cheapest prices available. The advice is start your search early to get the best price for your travel.
2013,3,"Not always accurate.   Some time have some weird price such as $20, But when trying to book, No $20 flights, of course."
2013,5,"This app is quick ,easy to use, and is saving me hundreds of dollars!! Haven't found the website equal anywhere. Move over Orbitz !"
2013,5,Amazing application..very very helpful.a must have on ever android and apple devices!
2013,5,"After checking many travel sites for flight information, I have found this one to be one of the easiest to use. I have found the cheapest fare possible, and will use again in the future."
2013,1,It only checks airports nearby me. I want to check MANY in the states. Let down.....
2013,3,This app was great. Now it shows a low fair on search and shows a diff fair in the final booking page. Fix it
2013,5,"Very easy to use, couldn't ask for anything better. Love it and recommend it BIG TIME!!  Enjoy :-)"
2013,5,I can find the cheapest flights quickly and confidently. Have tried to find cheaper flights searching other sites but 90% of the time scanner beats everything.
2013,5,"If you're spitballin vacay travel ideas and haven't figured out when and where yet, this app let's you search broadly across months showing airfare result from everywhere to everywhere."
2013,5,Easy to use.. with good filter options.. highly recommended..
2013,4,Very nice. One of very few i consider to be almost as good on tablet. Some points even better
2013,5,This app is a great tool to watch flights. I am planning for December. Love it!!!
2013,4,Love this app useful for booking tickets world wide..
2013,3,Could not book a ticket. App  just opened a browser and that was the end of it.
2013,4,Only one problem I find it shows u cheapest flights HAVE been not the prices they are so is annoying knowing someone else had same flight through same people at half price
2013,4,Ive noticed you can get cheaper from local travel centers not all the time but just a heads up  either way its very good
2013,5,Works great and is quick. Don't use the computer to find fares anymore.
2013,5,I've been searching for a few different flights and scanner became a must have app as it gives precise price guidelines to decide when its best to flight.
2013,5,Very handy app for travellers... Have tried many of the other travel apps but this seems to be the easiest and best for finding the cheapest flights....
2013,1,App worked great until recently.  Now every time I try to search flights it says there is no internet connection when there actually is.
2013,5,Truly functional. Perfect work. Thanks
2013,5,I can't believe someone finally came up with this app! It is extremely useful and amazing.
2013,5,"App works well, gives many options quickly, good prices, booking is easy"

2013,5,Everything is great about this. I hope they add fare alert option too.
2013,5,Absolutely love this app use it at least once a month! Quick and easy exactly what you want when booking flights.
2013,4,"Prices seem to change when you select flights, I suspect it's not whole of market too but app is generally good"
2013,5,I used to use ixigo before sky scanner and I found this app to be better on design and its quick. Recommended for everyone who are looking for a good comparison for flights.
2013,5,Love this app. Gets me a good selection of available flights and helps me find the cheapest flight.
2013,5,Gets reults.its vety practical. Has variety of options
2013,5,I hv searched for an airfare and found many results.. A great app

2013,5,Awesome app. I do all my trip planning through this app.
2013,5,"By finding the cheapest flights through this app, I was able to convince a travel agent to lower their price for me as they were more expensive than the one showed on the app...kudos!"

2013,5,"Intuitive interface, quick response, smooth user experience."

2013,1,"I'm attempting to book a flight from the app (doesn't work, no page reference) the app states the cost is $109 and the site says $164.   MISLEADING AND INACCURATE PRICING  UPDATE:  I used Orbitz and it was WAY simple and $12 less expensive. no redirecting, the price is right there with tax and you buy within the app. I'm no longer recommending Skyscanner until it improves the experience. #Uninstall"
2013,4,"This is by far my favourite app. It has given me the abbility to visit my dad overseas for the 1st time in 4 years. Flights that even the consultants don't know about!! I took my phone into the travel agency and spent ages finding a cheap flight... Take out my phone, smash on the app 30secs find a cheaper flight. Already enjoyed 1 holiday this year looking forward to the UK in July!!"
2013,2,"Downloaded the app to double check n see if I got a good deal on airfare to Scottsdale Municipal Airport in Arizona and it doesn't even list that as a valid destination... Kind of hard for me to give a good review when the app boasts ""every flight everywhere""... I was really hoping to use this app. Guess I will have to follow up after an update.."
2013,4,"I use this app pretty often. Love the ""Travel To: Everywhere"" feature and convenient rate calendar/ filtering format. My only complaint is that Skyscanner doesn't offer a multi-city option for flight searches! Other than that, I highly recommend it."
2013,3,"Overall, works well to book flights.  However, they did a poor job with time options on the return flights.  Example- Your departure flight is 5pm and return departure time on option is 8am.  You rather return on a LATER flight. There isn't a way to choose RETURN depature times, Expedia's and CheapOair app does a better job on that point."
2013,5,"Often smartphone apps are crowded and confusing. This however is simple, fast, intuitive, and works brilliantly. The developers clearly understand that software is only as good as the weakest point, but this wins on all counts. PLEASE don't go the way of so many developers and destabilise it with unnecessary updates and features that few want - it's great already! Kudos !!!"
2013,5,"For two weeks i would dread looking for flights on my phone because it was so time consuming! But... saw an add on facebook for this app. I knew it was an awsome website, because i previously booked my husbands ticket with the help of skyscanner when all other airlines and travel agents were telling me there were no flights for the nxt day under $900! I found such a cheap flight on skyscanner straight after I downloaded it on my phone, better than Webjet for sure!! I found it Faster too. Thanks skyscanner."
2013,1,"It worked when I first loaded it, in a cumbersome way, and then after a week it just stopped with an error message: ""Unfortunately Skyscanner has stoped."" you are then given two options: Report - which does not work; or OK ...mind you there is a third one called ""uninstall""."
2013,4,"I like that this app allows you to search not only specific airport but once close to the airport, this comes in handy when you live near several airports as I do, find the cheapest flight these days is key! Since the latest update I'm not overly thrilled with the search engine but otherwise this is a pretty good app I would definitely recommend it."
2013,3,"Works fine and the platform is lovely, however the only problem is that the actual links to book the flights simply don't work! This means it's only good for comparing flights, but certainly not for booking them."
2013,5,"My husband is from the UK and I am from the US so our families do a lot of international travel to visit our loved ones.  This app is a great way to track prices and find the best time to travel.    It's easy to use for and level of computer literacy.  This app has an interface so user friendly and intuitive that even if you have never traveled by plane in your life, buying an international plane ticket is no harder than ordering a pizza online!"
2013,5,"Don't waste time on advertised flights you can't actually book. Searches easyjet ryanair etc as well. Sometimes even cheaper than booking direct. Fly twice a week and skyscanner saves me a lot of time money and frustration. Skyscanner, thank you!"
2013,5,"I booked my trip from the UK, around Canada, USA and Cuba using this app and it was fantastic! Now I'm using it to book my next holiday to Vienna. Can't go wrong with this app. Very easy to use and organise anything with. Thanks Skyscanner!"
2013,1,"United has direct flights between BTV and CLE. When I filter for airline and nonstop, I get 25 results, none of which are the nonstops. App also crashes when I try to share results. Uninstalled and reinstalled it, but no improvement. Wrote to them over 2 weeks ago about these problems and got an automatic response but never a useful or helpful response."
2013,4,"Works good, but am not sure if it's showing all flights. Found a cheaper flight on here, and was going to book, but after reading reviews regarding that aspect, got a little skeptical. Otherwise, I love it"
2013,5,Very good app. Very useful fast and you can get all the infos you need at one place! The only thing is weird sometime it doesnt say the price so you need to chose the dates and go to next page to see how much will the flight cost you. But its just a small thing;)
2012,1,"This app does not seem to know that 1 of the largest airports in the area exist! It also requires you to search each airport individually, unless you want to search the US as a whole. Useful if it happens to have your airport, and you don't mind searching eat 1 individually to find the best price. They're really much better alternatives and I would rather find a computer than use this app."
2013,4,It's very user friendly and reliable. Have never seen anything better than this. But each time I have to filter by changing the destination have to go all the way back to first page and can't just change it on the page I am on. Rest all good.
2013,1,Easy to use but gave me prices for flights that could not be booked. These prices didn't even show up on the skyscanner website when I searched in my browser. Very disappointed at the false advertising.
2013,1,"App has made up of excellent idea but nly isuue m having is ""inaccurate flight rates"" there is huge difference between shown price an actual price. Sometimes 10x. With this bug there is no use of this. Pease fix it and I will give 5"
2013,5,Got to be one of the best flight search app out there . I used to have to go and look in all airlines websites and look under ten‚Äôs of category but now its different story. Looking for flight became something that take 5 to 15 min. All thanks to Skyscanner.  I only wish that it has  multi-city option.
2013,4,"One search on this app equates to many on individual airline websites. Easy way to find your ideal flights. First price tag is not the final deal, do not give your hopes up on ultra cheap flights."
2013,2,I don't really think those 5 star reviews are real. This app sucks. Not one mention of it taking you to the browser to complete the purchase. No point in having an app if it just takes you to their website.
2013,4,"love this app, so useful and easy to use. Can book flights right from my phone. Only complaint is it sometimes shows trips and prices that are no longer available, takes a bit to refresh I guess."
2013,4,Great way to check airfare and is also very quick and easy to use. I like to use this initially for flights then go to hotwire or priceline to book. Would be 5 stars easily if it had a function where it could alert you to cheap fares like watchdog.
2013,5,If you fly at least a couple times a year and especially if its a repeated trip.. its amazing. Just constantly monitor the same flights for the best deal possible.
2013,5,This is an awesome application. Very handy and useful. Should add option to search destinations carry out by particular airlines. Looking forward more features from the developers.. Keep going.. Best wishes..
2013,4,"That's all that needs to be said... Doesn't freeze or any sorta complications.. only use it to find flights though, never actually bought tickets from it"
2013,4,Very easy to use and pretty straight forward.   Perhaps the system could implement and state clearly which are the code sharing flight. At the moment I didn't see any.   It would be best if there we can see what equipment will be used for particular flight in search mode.   Cheers.
2013,5,"This is the best I have ever used, I like the way I can book my flight from anywhere in the world from any place. Don't try and tweak or upgrade, if something works leave it alone. Thanks"
2013,4,Very user friendly and generally finds very good prices.  Would be even better if there was an option to do multi-city searches.
2013,4,"The price was not very accurate, but skyscanner helped me plan my holiday with the ""to everywhere"" option.  It lists all flights from your local airport by price."
2013,1,"You pick your departure then suddenly the return prices jump up a ton! I don't think a last minute flight to Vegas would cost 500 per person. And let me guess, tax on top of that right? Can stay at New York New York for 4 nights plus nonstop flight $1500 Incl tax on any popular travel site. So why is this a savings?"
2013,3,"Works well if I put in departure dates. Almost never returns a result if I leave departure date as ""any"", which is why I'd choose this app over, say, Kayak."
2013,5,"I can't believe I didn't know about this before! It is fast, gives an excellent variety of flights to choose from and easy to operate. I recommend it to anyone looking for a deal and frequent travelers."
2013,5,I love skyscanner. The app is very easy to use and I found the best flight (money wise and time wise) to Italy for way less than I expected to spend on a flight ticket. Thanks for saving me a bundle!
2013,5,I am always looking up flights im so glad i found this app!! It has saved me so much time. I use to look up all different sites but Skyscanner puts them all in the one app. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a simple user face but maximum real time results
2013,5,Could do with the car hire search like the website. Still best I've found for cheap flights though. Guess some people would like the hotel option too
2013,4,Very good app. I have used it for apple and android its very fast and gets the bedt prices.  The interface with the airlines could be sharper but then that could as much to do with their website.
2013,5,"Brilliant! Was having a challenging time matching holidays with flights; this fits the bill. Prices not perfect, maybe due to baggage and taxes etc."
2013,5,I used to use all the separate airline websites to hunt down the best fares. This saves me the hour it would take! 30 seconds or so and you have all the options you could ever need. A must download!
2013,4,Very easy and fast. Just what you need to check many flights fast. Give 4 as I havent pay for any flights after finding here and Im not sure all right prices. For browsing  for me brilliant!
2013,5,...and has improved over time. Great for scanning a period of time to find the cheapest flights to somewhere. Much better correlation between headline  and actual prices.
2013,5,"Nice UI, easy to navigate. Wide variety of flights, I was pessimistic that it will have any flights on Indonesia but they have it all. Definitely a must have for air traveler."
2013,3,Good app so far but if you can only choose the date and time for flight out but return no choice. Pls provide this option. Thank you
2013,5,It's the easiest flight booking application out there and has the very cheapest prices.  No complex forms to fill in at the start.  Really excellent.  Galaxy Note 2.
2013,5,Skyscanner is great! I recently booked a flight saving 400/ person. I love the calendar feature on their website unfortunately the app only has the chart that I scroll through to get prices. Sometime the website and the app has different prices as well.
2013,5,"Skyscanner is simple, fast and provides the cheapest prices. It has awesome search options like looking for flights from country to country, not just airport to airport. I recommend heartily!"
2013,5,"I travel quite a lot and this app has helped so much making it easier to find cheap flights. It searches lots of different airlines, works surprisingly fast and I love the ability to share flights or book them straight from the app."
2013,4,Great for quick comparisons.  May hang once in a while but a solid app for the most part. Highly recommended but not perfect. Well worth the price of free...
2013,5,The love of my life is a Marine currently in Southern California. This app allows me to check prices fast and monitor fluctuations to find the very best deals :)
2013,5,I traveled thru Europe to 8 different countries last year and the cheapest deals I founded thru this website! And this app makes it much more accessible... great site and app!
2013,2,"The app displays the lowest fare for destinations, but when I try to find that fare it's nowhere to be seen. I have looked and not once found the cheapest advertised fare. Also, many of the fares are hidden below with a ^ symbol. There's no explanation as to what that symbol means or why fares are hidden."
2013,5,"Being on the run, it was  impossible to make sure I'm getting the best travel deal. However Sky scanner makes is adequately convenient... Love it"
2013,5,"Simply the best airfare comparison app on Google Play Store bar none. Excellent interface, good filters and able to scroll along a dateline to see fares on adjoining days. Brilliant."
2013,1,I don't know how good is inside the us but international prices sucks! Cheapest one charges double what I usually pay!! My advice do ur own womework
2013,4,quick results and easy to use! please add the only airport i use outside my home state (Orange County- John Wayne airport) and i'd rate 6 stars if i could!
2012,1,I don't blame the App' but the information that is fed to liescanner is nothing short of fabrication by the travel agencies... I have not found 1 flight for the cheapest price advertised. These are always independents and not the actual airlines themselves.
2013,4,Usability Is near perfect. Love the interface. Ensure harmony by pairing with Kayak doe cross checking flight prices.  Check it out !
2013,2,"Even when not in use for days it's always taking 9~20MB and CPU time, ence draining the battery.  If a user closes an app, he wants it close, not running on the background taking memory and draining the battery."
2013,5,This app is pretty good and easy to use. It would be awesome if future updates could add the hotel search feature as the website does now. Highly recommend this app!
2013,5,"Easy to find cheapest flights for a planned trip or random adventure! love that you can leave the destination field blank, and just find somewhere cheap and go, great interface too, and very accurate pricing."
2013,4,"Seems very complete, I haven't really used it much in real life, but I certainly will next time I travel, well done, thanks."
2013,4,It's a very helpfull web which can significantly save your time to browse all available airways one by one. The android-version is even much more time-efficient and easier to use.
2013,5,"I have used many engines to search flights but there is nothing compared to this. Its simple, easy, and fast to list lots of flights to your destination. Also switching destinations and take off locations is quick. Amazingly, this app keeps track of your search record so that any time you can see what and where you have desired  go. If yoi are new to this app, relax its the best one out there. Google rocks!"
2013,5,"I can honestly say I LOVE this app! I have a number of apps and this is my favorite by far. I love to fly when I travel, however as we all know it can be expensive, this app makes it easy to fly because it finds the best flight for you. Very easy to use and navigate. My friends are shocked whenI can find a better price than anyone else. You will have the ability to do the same with Skyscanner!"
2013,5,"I love the website, the app is as good. Simple to use and accurate its difficult to see what extra features you need. Thoroughly recommend this to any traveller."
2013,2,Doesnt give me more than one flight per day and its usually not the cheapest . Nice app but doesnt work properly in canada. Nice interface tho .
2013,3,Were always looking for a promo fare here in the phillippines! But the promos doesnt shown here in this app! Stil im signing in at google search
2013,5,I found it very helpful while I was planning to take my family on holiday. I was waiting for the best deal to buy and this app check the flight deals on the go. Thanks
2013,4,Excellent app. Just need to be careful to check the single trip button when doing a quick search for who flies where and when. Also you can easily end up looking at flights 2 months ahead of when you want to fly.
2013,5,I like this app. It's simple and thanks for the last update regarding the Omani rial. But I hope to see the multi-destination booking option.
2013,5,It is really quick and easy to use.  I have been planning my trip around Europe and it is by far the best tool on the market!
2013,5,Its a fast and easy to use app. Works very well on my S3 and does not take up space. Will definitely recommend downloading it.
2013,4,Just used this app to book my next flight.....works like a dream and beat all the competition on price........only thing it needs is a 'flexible dates' option.....with this it'd be 5 Stars
2013,5,Really beats going from one site to another any comparing. Some airlines which i don't normall check out are also included and sometimes comes out as the better option..tnx!
2012,5,"I love the layout of this app. Very easy to use - not tried to book anything through it yet, but am impressed so far."
2013,2,"Tried to book a flight with RyanAir, not only did it take very long for everything to load (waiting 3+ seconds after pressing any button), but when I pressed the button ""Book"", it redirected me just to the homepage of RyanAir, not the page with my travel information..."
2013,1,THIS APP IS A FRAUD. It shows you low price and takes you to faregeek's website WHICH IS A FRAUD. IT TAKES YOUR MONEY AWAY AND CANCELS YOUR TICKET WHICH YOU HAVE TO PAY AGAIN FOR THE CANCELLATION. DONOT USE IT..
2013,1,Needs a refresh feature after adjusting filter and it doesn't remember filter settings. Uninstalling till it gets finished.
2013,1,Checked 4 flights   one to guangzhou from Alaska.   had to go to dubai first. Took two days for flight.   1660 cost.   Found two flights on Expedia and vayama That were 80 to 100 cheaper and only took 16 hrs.  Flights went to Beijing then to guangzhou versus dubai!!!
2013,5,"Excellent app, cheap flights and great flexibility like whole month, go anywhere, all major currencies. Helped me get to NZ to UK very cheaply, thanks :-)"
2013,4,Love the app but I wish you could filter out certain airlines that you don't want to use. It can be a hassle sorting through prices when trying to avoid certain carriers.
2013,5,Very user friendly. Returns searches quickly and gives just the right amount of information. Best flight search tool around. Highly recommended.
2013,4,Great application although it doesn't feature all flights from Bulgaria so yiu still need to search more. But it is very  useful in offering flight combinations
2013,5,"Actually got a very good price not picked up elsewhere.  Which given prices lately, definitely appreciated. Thanks"
2013,3,"Only shows cebu pacific only. Please update to invlude philippine airlines, air phil express, tiger airways, zest air, seair and air asia."
2013,1,"Interesting concept, but confusing ui.  The prices it returns are way too high. Uninstalling"
2013,4,Easy to use with good layout. Only minor bug that sometimes the Share button doesn't work.
2013,5,Works well and fast. Filters and timeline price view are really useful. Great ui. Highly recommended.
2013,5,"I book travel as part of my job, I couldn't manage without it. I love nothing more than check prices to far off exotic places. One day I will visit these places booked thru this app. Excellent!"
2013,5,Really helps me finding lowest cost airline. Interface very simple and user friendly. Thanks!
2013,5,"Very easy to use, clear ..just the right app for mobile phones. Its eaven clearer than Travelocity in a big computer screen."
2013,5,"Just bought a ticket to Amsterdam, really cheap it has a perfect way of looking for cheap flights, for example, from berl√≠n to anywhere any day, you'll find the cheapest ticket for a date that Skyscanner choose. Pretty useful.  Totally recommended"
2013,5,"Great service, and very easy layout. Skyscanner search will spoil you with a very comprehensive range of choice. I love it."
2013,5,Very easy to use with a great layout of the best prices for a certain month. I find this app better to use than my p.c!
2013,5,Quick access to the latest prices and a great layout. The widget is a nice touch for when I want to keep an eye on a certain destination.
2013,3,Here in the Philippines Airlines are frequently offering promo fare. I suggest that it should also be shown. Like now from June 15 to 18 they are offering up to P18.00 for domestic flights travel period from June onwards
2013,1,I refused to believe the cheapest flight to my destination was over a thousand dollars got on internet and first link found the same flight for 631. This was a waste of time
2013,5,Easy to use and finds amazingly cheap tickets. I've only had it on my phone for about 20 minutes & I've already recommended it to others!
2013,5,I use this app everytime I plan a trip. Consistently provides the best prices along with a number of tools for customizing your travels.
2013,5,Wonderfull app and great site in general!! It is so easy to have a good overview of ALL options available on the market!! If you don't have it installed this is a sure MUST!!
2013,5,Amazingly fast. I don't know how they do it but it works. Well worth 5 stars
2013,4,Can get 5 star if open-jaw search option is included.
2012,4,Could use an updated UI and a more accurate fare predictor (calendar view) to spot deals.
2013,5,I like it much better than other travel sites they do t do mobile well. Picked it up I Norway from my best friend best.
2013,2,Good app but I cannot find any.of the cheapest priced flights when going into the detail. Frustrating.
2013,5,"Helpful but you won't really see all budgeted promos from all airlines. Nonetheless, I get most of my cheap flights from skyscanner."
2013,5,"Fantastic app. Straight forward, very userfriendly and gives you best avail. Deal"
2013,5,Excellent app with well designed features for regular Travellers. Adding more customizable options would definitely help.  Cheers
2013,5,Seriously finds you the best price for anywhere around the world! Thank you soo much!
2013,5,No bugs. Quick and easy to use. Great for last minute weekend get aways. Booked a flight from las vegas to Honolulu for $300 roundtrip. I'm in love!
2013,5,Easy to use. You can see the cheapest flight in an instant. Nice sorting and filter options too.
2013,5,Really useful... though I havent booked any flights yet using the app... the interface is really nice.
2013,5,"Pretty easy allows you to see and choose the cheapest date, and has different formats for easy viewing. Cheapest flight? I guess... I mean its easier than doing good research on the web."
2013,5,"I love this app. I'd previously used the website on the pc, but the app is even quicker to use. Just remember the price quoted by Ryanair doesnt include their extortionate baggage charge, crazy!!!!"
2013,5,I never thought that this app is a real deal!.. 5 star isnt enough.. I wil give dis app 10 stars..great job!
2013,4,Only so that allows unspecified dates and will return prices over a timeline. This allows you to plan trips around prices much easier.
2013,4,I like my last minute deals and like most am too lazy to seach it myself so this is great app and quite even when working on mobile network i give it handy 4 out of 5
2013,1,"Kept telling me no results. I tried a few different dates and airports, but no go. The site looks great, though!"
2013,5,I really adore this app! It provides me with all the possible flights for any destination with no-fuss booking. This will definitely come in handy for a long time!
2013,4,Fares shown in d preview are usually incorrect.maybe they could sync it more often. It's very disheartening to see the fares jump when u reach d final screen.
2013,5,Awesome app. Easy to use. Finds the best deals. Used it many times to find great deals on flights.
2013,4,Nice. ..except for Branson (BKG) that's in Missouri. My parents live there. Skyscanner has it listed as Hollister California...but really that airport is in Hollister Missouri!
2013,4,"Great and fast app, love to use it. Five stars if multi-stop searches will be included."
2013,1,"Time and time again when using the any day search where it shows the bar pricing for multiple days, the price is never really what shows up in that list.. Instead its always higher!!"
2013,5,I used this App for my last trip. Works great . Even travel agent couldn't find same prices on their system
2013,5,"just surprise this app can accommodate all, i mean truly all flight schedules and can manages them just using this app and yes it can show your local currency. Grab it and u wont regret it. Perfect"
2013,4,This App gives great prices and gelps you search for the cheapest flights at your convinience... I totally recommend this app without a doubt
2013,4,Found this app simple to use and have booked return flights to Florence. Only issue is that the final cost when booked was more than the indicated cost by about ¬£50 per person.
2013,5,Perfect for getting the best deal... Even if u dont have specific dates it tells you the cheapest time to fly...
2013,4,I've been able to monitor the prices of a trip I want to make and it's the best feature of this app. I love it!
2013,1,"sends me twice around the world even for simple, straightforward hub-to-hub searches. can't imagine what`s gonna pop up for a flight from chile to crimea, for instance."
2012,5,Used it to book last minute to Puerto Rico and got us the Cheapest fair..better deal than Priceline.
2013,3,"Well,, its a good app, however sometimes the price shown in the search result may difference when you go to detail itinerary. It would be 5 stars when it show accurate result."
2013,5,As I said it is very accurate and fast. It can help you find a flight over any airlines. I tested it in domestic flights in Saudi Arabia and it worked like a charm. The app offers you different ways to book your flight.
2013,4,great so far.not disappointed!thank you sky scannet-now back to my holiday flight search..!
2013,5,Easy to use and navigate. Fuss-free and very informative. One of the best travel/ booking apps I've used.

2013,5,Haven't flown any yet but looks to be great deals! Booking our holiday through it.

2013,5,"Missing one thing, though, multiple cities flights. But works really great, I loved it!"
2013,4,"Just started to use this app, but I gave it 4 stars already.  It told me where I could go within what I want to pay immediately as I opened up the app for the first time."
2013,4,Keep the good work going and pleaaw see if u can incorporate the feedback/suggestions given.
2013,4,This app is great. It search straight away for the cheapest flights but whats best is that ur search details stay. So u can keep checking

2013,5,Found amazing deals and saves time going on all the usual travel sites. So easy to use.
2013,4,I think it is good if it can show the breakdown of the total cost. So far this app is best for the people who look for cheap flights everyday.
2013,3,"Prices seam fair but lately once you click on the flight, it jumps up in price. Sometimes when u try to book you end up starting from scratch at the websights booking prosses"
2013,5,Best flights searching and comparison app about! Found a great deal there!   keep up the good work!!

2012,5,"Great ap , one of my favourite on my phone . Works really well even in places with bad connection"
2013,5,"I found only one disadvantage - you can't keep more than 3 searches in history. It would be great to have more if you choosing berween 4 directions, for example, and need to check all of them for some time."
2013,4,"I just wish they showed all the prices at those bars, so I can choose the best date, but I guess it's not the app's fault. Very nice!"
2013,3,Nice looking app however I tried this app and compared it to jetstar website and the prices were cheaper for same flight online and also the app didn't show all the flights available on the day I searched.
2013,5,"Fast, simple and intuitive interface. Very handy widget to track prices of your favourite destinations."
2013,4,First experience with such kind of software... It is not necessary u booked ur tickets via this but u can review all necessary information..

2013,5,What if you could slip away for a couple days? This app helps make your dreams a reality.

2013,5,The app works very smoothly.  No problems to report.

2013,5,The best app.. So easy and fast.. The best.way to find great deals..
2013,2,I wanted to find a cheap flight so I downloaded this app and found that it didn't have the cheapest...Expedia had much cheaper flights.

2013,5,It's been good so far. Works as i need it to worlk
2013,4,"very good app for comparing flights although the 'price from' is never the actual cheapest price. it is always higher, but does show indications which is good"

2013,3,there are only 2 airlines for Philippines. please add airphilexpress because they also of cheap fares.
2013,5,Great apps... Keep up the good work!
2013,4,Very good service for finding out about flight times but the booking system isn't great and it did miss out several airlines when I was searching but overall it is a great little app

2012,5,Works very quick and have yet to find a program to beat it. Very happy with results

2013,4,Love the widget! It checks prices daily for my dates!
2013,1,This app used to be amazing but now it just doesn't seem to reliably find fares even from major airline websites.
2013,5,Wish I'd downloaded this prior to booking flights to Amsterdam could have saved about 50 quid although own flights have more favourable departure times.

2012,4,"Great app to find really great deals.  I could help my mom meet my wife's family for the first time because of this app.  It's not perfect, but I have very minor reasons.  Overall, worth downloading if you need affordable plane tickets."
2012,5,Awesome app! Really efficient for finding good and cheap flights! Loving it!
2013,5,This app really gr8 app. Thanks to developers
2012,5,good to check and compare prices of flights.
2012,5,Good apps.
2012,5,Fantastic app !
2012,5,Excellent!
2012,5,Superb..
2013,5,Great
2012,4,Works great but would be nice if billing country changes automatically to current location. Now it's on US until changed manually and I had to find this out by accident. Also make the setting more prominent instead of hiding it so deep in the settings as it can have a huge effect on search results. Almost 5 stars.
2012,5,"I owe this app big time. Had to schedule a flight to STL within a month, and this app got me the best price overall. By over a hundred dollars. Even after I researched all of the bargain sites and this was still the best deal. Extra points for the UI. I am so grateful for this app. It was a Godsend. Thanks guys!"
2012,4,"The app is really outstanding. It does what is supposed to do easily and fast. However, I give it only 4 stars since it doesn't have the option to save your search in order to be advised for different fares. Then it would be 5 stars..."
2012,1,"Why do you need to read my phone log ? I dont understand how app to compare flight needs access to some of the areas you ask. I think you best remain with having internet access and GPS location, rest is none of your business.  Uninstalled."
2013,5,"Best app to search for your flight ever. Just type in the airport from which you wish to depart from and land, the options are many and you can select a specific day, week or just look through the whole month or year. U can also select only the country and it will tell u the best farr and what city according to the price and so on. Amazing!"
2012,5,"Excellent work. Your android dev team is worth its weight in gold. I woul like to suggest the following - loose the iPhone style rollers in the date picker. There are loads of android themed widgets. I know your designers are apple geeks, dont listen to them :)   Keep up the excellent work"
2013,4,Excellent app! Saves your searches so you can come back & check frequently for price changes. I found cheap tickets to Hawaii bc of this app. Only reason I give it 4 stars is bc my AVG alerted me this app has malware embedded in it.
2012,2,Beware when the app gives you a different airline for your return journey. Especially for Barclelona return flights. It gave me Ryanair only to find out that Ryanair don t use Barcelona International but an airpirt 100 miles away. This meant booking my return flight elsewhere and i had to cut short my break.
2012,5,"Only booked one flight through this app so far but will use again frequently! after much comparison and searching elsewhere, a friend told me about this app. It came up with the same flight that i had pinned down as the best deal, except instead of taking hours it took seconds! Came on to look up another flight and decided to rate it so others can share in my joy"
2012,2,"Very complete with one problem. They have to be charging a fee on the back end because the fares they find are ALL more expensive than ALL of the other popular travel apps ie: Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity, etc. Very good app otherwise. Just don't know why I would pay over $50 more for same flights."
2012,3,Nice idea but the prices are always higher than showing when I try to book. When I tried to book the airfare Almost never had the same fare as it scaned. Price jumps about 20%. Can't search one way fare either.
2012,3,The app doesn't offer the same flight search enzgine capacity as the online one. As well as the special deals and offers are missing from the app.  It is only useful for preliminary search if flights for users.
2012,4,"Excellent comparison tool, it's fast and easy to analyze the information returned. However, you should not book through the app, the lowest priced results may be even lower through the actual airline's webpage."
2012,4,"Good app, there could be some more improvements for updates. If the developers ever read these comments, add the option for a multi-stop flight. Also, it'd be great if the selection of airlines could be improved."
2012,2,My first try at finding a flight and it's saying no results and that it could be a number of reasons (how vague). I know it's not connectivity since I have mobile and wifi signal. The flight is fine as I checked on Ryanair's website. Hmmm
2012,4,"This really is one of the best applications I have even used for travel purposes. Interface is great, it's very convenient and lightweight. Room for improvement exist but good as is."
2012,4,"Very good app., would give five stars if fares become more current  and up to date. Compared to other web based options could use some tweaking in getting fare information."
2012,3,It is quite easy to use. Good for a fast ref. Then I start to realise not all airlines are in there. I am talking abt full fledged big airlines missing in the selections. If can improve it will be an even better app!!
2012,5,"Top app. So much better than having to search website. Can just click an option to change flights, tines, dates, destinations whatever. Very helpful, especially when your dates are flexible."
2012,3,Following points if incorporated will be good. 1. Saved results deletion option which updates the widget 2. Notification if there is a change in price on the saved query 3. Refresh the results with latest price if clicked on the refresh button on the widget
2012,5,"Seriously impressive travel app, does exactly what you want and appears to find the best prices saving loads to time and frustration. Love the explore feature which us esp useful if you thinking of where to go."
2012,5,"Haven't booked with it yet, though just from searches...it is quick, easy to use, I've already saved some favorite trips, it finds the best deals, better than my search engine on the computer! What more can I say....thanks for a great app."
2012,5,Successfully found flights on indirect routes that were suitable for both time and price. Has made life so much easier at avoiding the likes of Byanair & Lazyjet. Thank you.
2012,5,"This apps is prefect. in fact, very awesome. lot easier than going through each flight website to have a look. congrat to dev team. but i got one MINOR prob. the banner ads sometimes blocking the top buttons whenever im in landscape mode (nexus 7).how do you remove the ads? im willingly to pay for a pro versiom just to get rid of the ads banner. or dev team could just fix it. any way,, awesomee apps!"
2012,3,Well I noticed right away that's not all airlines are included in this app. even though in the title it says all flights. I would say this is misleading. so I gave it a 3 star
2012,5,"I love this app! It just works so smoothly, finding the best price seamlessly. Easier than using the website I find. Kudos dev team"
2012,4,"There isn't much wrong with this app - the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because as yet I've not figured out how to search for date ranges. For specific dates and by month: yes, but for a shorter range like a week: no."
2012,5,Exactly what i was looking for and i love the option of adding searches to favourites. Its smooth fast and shows me what i want. Im happy :)
2012,5,"I am travelling very much and absolutely prefer this App! Easy handling and best deals, since I still did cross-checks, but now I just rely on it."
2012,5,The best app I have ever used! Thanks for allowing me to make my dreams come true in such an easy fashion! Fours years on the road (or should I say in the air?) and counting!
2012,5,"Convenient, easy to use, attractive and helpful. This app is absolutely great. My husband and I do a lot of international travel and I am able to check on this app on a daily basis. A few times it hasn't had the lowest prices available but they always eventually show them. I Recommend this app to anyone who frequently flies."
2012,5,Perfect. I have used sky scanner for years now and this mobile app is just as good as the desktop. Thanks guys! Keep up the great work.
2012,5,Love the widget so much :-)  The new calendar works better too. Ty4 such a great update.
2012,5,I have been able to use  the calendar function to get the best prices for China.  Can't do this with the PC version.  This application gave the best price and was easy to use.
2012,5,Works well. The widget is fun too...would actually be useful if u could filter out results from Ryan Air!
2012,4,"There are so many apps, when you get one that works first up, it is refreshing. Any time saver is a money maker..."
2012,4,prices seem to be a few dollars more than the average Orbitz or whatever... but comparable and not bad. I definitely like the app.
2012,4,Good app! Best if you can include SGD currency too. Look forward to an update! Thanks
2012,5,this is an amazing app. I tried a number of apps before it including Kayak and Expedia and none of them found flights for the low cost airline closest to me. this app found me so much more flights...cheaper flights...than those other apps. not to mention its just beautiful and simple to use. 5 stars without hesitation.
2012,5,"ABSOLUTELY the VERY BEST application for finding flights with quick sorts for price, direct or one stop flights, duration of flight, take off times & return times. Start off with setting ideal dates. Then, with a simple click, one can switch scenes to a visual colorful bar chart to easily see cheapest available price as well as day to day price differences if you want to consider available savings on alternate dates. Only negative change is that app used to also show discounted airlines, but not recently."
2012,1,"Used to work pretty good before, but now it does not find anywhere close to all available flights. The web version is way superior."
2012,5,Fast n EZ to find good prices... Please don't add anything else to slow it down. Thank you.
2012,3,"Good but prices for certain dates are not displayed so that is a bit annoying. If that is fixed, then can easily get 5 stars. Good app otherwise."
2012,5,One of the greatest apps around. Used it on a three month vacation in Europe traveling to 8 countries and 13 cities. Saved me hundreds of Dollars. Hint: changing the billing country in settings may actually search certain web sites in that country and give you better or worse prices. Worth trying.
2012,5,"Find it very useful as a hint to expected flight cost, but still would use airline's official site on pc for booking. Thanks for a handy tool!"
2012,4,"Certainly the features were satisfying. However, there are flights that can be filter in the website is not shown in the app. Improvement can be made."
2012,4,thanks for adding scoot airlines in ur search! helps a lot more in price comparison across all cheaper airlines! appreciate that!!
2012,5,The service and the accuracy in fares is excellent..i travel a lot so I have to keep checking the flight details regularly and this app made it very easy & comfortable for me..moreover its UI is also simple yet attractive n very user friendly.
2012,5,"I don't usually review apps, life's too short, but this app is simply astounding. It gets prices for flights from all airlines and is especially useful for finding the hidden bargains on Ryanair and Easy jet. It will also give you prices for the whole year. I can't find any faults with it and I would even pay for this app and I never pay for apps."
2012,5,"Great app... It works, 1st time I used it, saved more than double the cost of my usual tickets.  Good job!!!"
2012,4,"Clean UI, nice widget and seems quick, all in all very good app, would be 5 but as yet not sure if the widget is updating automatically before I click it"
2012,5,superb. I like the way this app works. makes searching lot more easier.  5stars for me.  worth downloading..
2012,5,"Instalei o app e em menos de 5min eu ja tinha comprado minha passagem internacional por 50% a menos do preco que eu vinha acompanhando ha semanas. Um achado! Got an international flight ticket  for literally half of the normal price using this app, in less than 5min after the download. Simply awesome!!!"
2012,5,"I mean it just does what you'd expect it to do... which is unusual in an app, so hats off to them. Makes choosing flights a doddle. Shame you have to then use the ailine websites which are confused to say the least."
2012,1,I book the tickets on this program and had problem with dates just cas its keep jumping between oct 2012 to dec 2012. Then the travel agent i book with is Chinese agent cant speak english . My suggestion is check the price and date and call the agent before you pay
2012,4,"In my girlfriend's Android 2.2 there is an amazing widget, but in my android 4.1.2 it doesn't exist! Where is the widget for Jelly Beans OS? If you fix it I would give u 5 stars!"
2012,5,Very good app. Saves time and hassle of browsing the web. Good way to quickly compare options.
2012,3,It doesn't give one the option of departing from one airport and returning to another(multi-airport). Please fix!
2012,4,It's good but then checked for more than 01 pax the price shown and later when you confirm it says not available I think this should have shown on first page only. Overall excellent app
2013,4,Four stars for its usefulness. There are some airlines that are not included in the search. Ill give five stars if the software updated to include them.
2012,5,I'm not one for doing business on a smart phone but I must say this is probably the best app amongst others and so easy to negotiate!  THANK YOU!
2012,5,I didnt uninstall it with the others one because this is the best application about aviation. I would like this application on my next gadget too. I thank the team members who have designed this.
2012,5,"This app is so easy to use, all the necessary options are in there. Thanks for making my life so much easier."
2012,3,"Good but why are prices shown different on the charts and they appear increased by alot after u click on one of the days on the chart?.. and when u click book, there is a further increase of around 20-25 pounds on every flight."
2012,5,so easy to find/compare prices for flights! recommend anyone check this app out before booking flights.. may be suprised.
2012,5,"Im looking at travelling next year and this app is quick, efficient and easy to use, which has helped me no end. Superb."
2012,5,Excellent application. It covers all the web site features! It could be added a feature with easy click buy!
2012,5,This is an excellent application to use especially when you travel a lot. I usually check this app first before I book my tickets on the airline's website. Definitely a good app to have.
2012,5,This App is one of the most efficient and reliable on my device. Brilliant for finding flights & monitoring prices. Ive been able to plan even complex trips with ease.
2012,3,Pretty good app which loads quickly and remembers your last search so you don't have to enter again if you are keeping an eye on prices. The prices quoted are cheap but not the cheapest when looking at another site.
2012,4,"Great application works well, and good to see you listen to your customers and removed the need for accessing phone identity."
2012,5,"I've looking for an app that gives me the option of searching for a wide range of airlines, thanks to this one I can do that with ease ."
2012,5,Must have app. Searches no-frills airlines also. Works everywhere as local site.
2012,5,I have been using Skyscanner for a long time. Now it is even easier having it on mobile. I can check the cheapest fair. So this way I can simply challenge those who promotes price guarantee
2012,5,"It is rare that I give anything  full marks, but this wad easy to award 5 stars for what this app does. And so fast too! Top marks. This is a must have"
2012,5,One of the best mobile apps. Powerful yet simple and very user friendly.
2012,2,It was ok till new update requires phone call permission  and not even explaining why.. uninstalling.
2012,1,Told about it from friend in Holland. Sorry first attempts big turn off. Not mobile friendly and not designed by people who need to use it
2012,4,"Great. Loses a star,as it would be better if u could see other classes of travel besides economy.."
2012,5,"Easy to update and see the price for a quick trip, or monitor deals for a flight down the road."
2012,5,"Best for finding a cheap flight, if you don't care where or when.  Impulse purchase short breaks. For specific dates and routes, I use other apps."
2012,4,Simple to use. Clear interface. Accurate results. Very happy with this app.
2012,5,Very convenient app since I was always on the website looking for flight!  Checks multiple other sites and allows you to see pricing for each day of the month. Love skyscanner!
2012,5,So effortless.....and quick even my 3 yr old niece could use this. The interface is that smooth.
2012,5,"Works great, you can search flights from an airport to anywhere or to any airport in a country. You can see the prices on a calendar and choose the cheapest."
2012,5,It's a great app! Found great deals and booked several international flights with this.
2012,5,Really like the way fares are laid out - easy to navigate and understand search features.
2012,4,The best to find cheap flights and the companies that actually offer that flight that you are after.  I only miss the map available in the website
2012,5,"I absolutely love this app, all those normally tedious to find flight details at my fingertips in seconds. Keep up the great work."
2012,4,"This app is just amazing. However, when looking for flights during a certain month or week, the best price presented is not for said period, but overall."
2012,5,"Easy to use, great UI, fast, it does what it needs to do and more (I love the 'fly to everywhere' option)"
2012,5,A1. Love this app. Saves loads of time. Works well. Galaxy S3
2012,5,A pleasure doing business. Thank you. I loved this app.
2012,5,Very good app. but should be an option to pick multiple destination with correspoding dates.
2012,5,Works a treat on Samsung galaxy tab 10.1. Got some bargains through this app.
2012,4,Yet to actually buy a ticket through this but has been a pretty good 'shop around for a better deal' tool
2012,5,I never rate apps but this one is a must when your planning on flying. Quick and easy way to book the cheapest flights worldwide!! AAA+++
2012,5,Simple interface. No problems found so far.   5/5
2013,5,It's all you need really! Fast and pretty darn accurate on prices. I like that it also already includes all taxes on ticket prices.
2012,5,Nice!! Download this apps you can use this if you have plans to teavel elsewhere....
2012,4,Not bad when it comes to searching for flight fares.. not good if you actually book as it sends you to other sites where you may or may not find the fare you chose.
2012,5,I am so happy to have found this app. It's making my travel plans a wonderful experience. I recommend it to anyone who needs to plan flights.
2012,4,Works perfectly does everything I want and has the widest range of flights and options compared to other sites
2012,5,"Vivo viajando, e muitas vezes preciso adiantar o v√¥o... Esse app √© a melhor ferramenta! Recomendo!"
2012,4,Does what it should. Works well and easy to use.
2012,4,"Quick & Easy, would double check pricing info, Samsung Galaxy III"
2012,5,This is the most wanted application for mobile traveller. Very helpful. But some of small airways route is not calculated. Yeah still considering ok
2012,4,"It's great that you can chose recent searches, but would be better if you could check the dates either side of the selected dates like you can on the web page."
2012,4,Very useful tool when you need to check out the various options on flight times on any given day
2012,5,"As title suggests, this app is fast and easy to use for  comparing flight prices. I like the fact all uk airports can be viewed so you can see prices from all your nearest airports if like me you live within 80 miles of 4 airports."
2012,5,Makes looking for flights home so much simpler! And android app much easier than desktop version
2012,5,it's what you need in your phone for airline booking. and find the cheapest ticket
2012,5,"This app is f amazing!! It has everything, the cheapest prizes, all the available airports for you to choose from, it even has statistics for you to see and compare the prizes and find the one that is suitable for you! Amazing app!! Top of the top!!"
2012,4,I have found this app to be very handy and informative. It is nice to have one app do all the work for you and provide with a great amount of useful information!!!
2012,5,Found better deals with this app than a any other website or app.
2012,5,"Clean layout, flexible options and what I like best is how it shows prices for all dates for you to chose from"
2012,5,This is the best ever compare to the others and you will see. Book from the phone not from the computer is more cheaper.
2012,5,"Great website, have used it for years, but they've done a GREAT job of converting it to app form too. Cant praise it enough."
2012,5,Works fast and remembers previous searches. Easy to amend details and arrange results.
2012,5,I loved the web version and the android app version is way better.:-) easier to navigate. Thanks
2012,5,"Great features shows all the best deals out, very accurate and efficient , recommend to anyone on the go"
2012,4,"I m using in turkey.Firstly,Tnx for everythink.l left four stars.because this app don't have some company such as Pegasus,onurair,sunexpress..please fix it !"
2012,4,does exactly what it says it will. v/happy user
2012,4,Works well for a free app. sometimes the price is different when you go times book the ticket.
2012,4,Great app! The graph comparison is one of its best feature.
2012,4,I'd give 5 stars if the function to search for cheapest price on the timescale was easier to use and gave more insightful information.
2012,4,"I love this app, but a Multi city option would be helpful"
2012,5,Easy to use. Checks all including the budget airlines. I use it often as I travel with my job. Saves me checking all the airlines separately.
2012,5,Very good app for galaxy y phone. One of the most important app on my phone.
2012,5,This app is great! Does exactly what you want it to do. Really looking forward to finding some bargains!!
2012,4,Checking flightprices can be a pain in the #$##. With this app i have my widgets telling me when to buy it..ahh life is good
2012,3,"It's a good app if none of the cheap airlines are flying on the date you need to go, and you want to find a cheap altetnative"

2013,3,"Not a bad app, but it could be so much better. Prices are not updated often enough, so when I select a fare it's often not available. That means I have to load each day separately which defeats the purpose of the app, which is to save me time. It also means it's not a reliable tool to monitor flights over a period of time unless you have hours to spend on it. And still no open jaws? Other sites have had that feature for years! Check fares more often and add open jaws for more stars. Until then you leave yourselves open to someone else coming up with a better app."
2012,4,"Skyscanner does it job accurately- it has consistently been my travel search companion for 2 years and the app has always provided me precise results, with crisper results than local travel agents. However, there is scope for improvement- A missed feature is ""Flexible date search"", where the app should list cheap fares in a range of dates. Probably app writers should take inspiration from website such as KLM, where return fares are provided on a 2D chart, plotting us the most economic fare in a different color for ease. If this option were there, it would make searches easier and I'd rate it 5-star :-D"
2012,4,"I don't like the way it says one price, then you click it and its higher, then click again to book and its higher still. I think airlines try to game or strongarm the system, probably not sky scanner itself.   A very useful tool, not least just for seeing the destinations quickly for each airport and drafting ideas.  Routing is sometimes wrong, missing or just plain led. Again, not sure if airlines are withholding info to try to game it. Must be difficult trying to get these companies to compete fairly."
2013,1,"I'm sure this will get buried but here goes.  The graphics and interface are OK. accuracy and customer service ( what a joke)  are nonexistent (waited over a day for email response on time sensitive pricing)  Prices that say"" LIVE"" were hundreds of $$ different. Most just routed you to the Airline and in a couple cases the price was ove $500 different than the "" so called"" LIVE PRICE."
2012,2,"I sort my flight by non stop, and it never shows anything unless I look at all flights.  You have options to tailor your search,  but u never actually get to use this feature bc it just won't let u see anything but all the flights.  Ugh. Doesnt show all airlines either.."
2012,3,"Concept is nice and I like how the interface shows you the lowest prices for days at a glance.  But when the glance price can vary as much as $100 or more from the actual search price on a typically $400 ticket, it ultimately becomes useless and a waste of time.  Kayak is safe for now."
2012,1,"On Galaxy Tab with Gingerbread i get ""the page fault cannot be set. . ."" error. So cannot install on SD card! On several other attempts to launch app after eventual successful installation, it consistently crash! This is an appalling app. Uninstalling. . . Never to reinstall! ;("
2012,4,"It is one of the better flight apps out there.  Most the time you don't have set dates, but this app tells you all the possible flights so you can find the cheapest flight.  I believe you have to go and order the flights by the airlines and some flights might not exist, but at least they give you all the options to find your flight"
2012,4,"I love this app!  This is extremely easy to use and is always updating flight fees so you have the most current information.  You can book your flight right from your phone.  It also does not hog your phone memory like the kayak app does.  this app does not give hotel or car rental information, otherwise I would have given it a prefect rating."
2012,5,"Love this app - makes price comparisons for flight ticket prices so easy while on the go. The chart comparison UI is great to quickly explore different price options. Would be great if the functionality can support searching for packages, e.g. flights+car, flights+hotel, flights+car+hotel."
2012,1,"Could be great little app, if didn't forget to include world's largest airline Delta	Their claim that you can compare all flights everywhere would be nice, BUT they forgot to include Delta Airlines, arguably the world's largest airline.  What's worse is that they don't tell you of their omission and I had to figure it out for myself. What a waste of time."
2012,4,More user-friendly than similar apps. Doesn't always provide the cheapest options at times. Please compare with budget airlines websites that service the same route when selecting a flight.
2012,4,The layout of product is perfect! Before using this app I had several travel search apps; I can now get rid of them.
2012,5,"If your looking for the cheapest flight tickets you can find, you NEED to have this app!  Tried using KAYAK but its very slow and cumbersome on my phone, unlike this app- very FAST and SMOOTH app ***LOVE the graph comparison view!*** thank you for this AWESOME APP!!"
2012,5,As a long term user of the website this app is just as convenient for flight price comparison. Does what it says on the tin. Nothing annoying about it at all. Easy to use. Well done.
2012,5,"I never leave reviews but had to for this app. Absolutely no problems, very user friendly. Loved the website, now love the app, perfect for checking flights on the go. Very happy. HTC One X."
2012,4,"Still lacks the ability to input multiple airports at once - you only have the option to select ""nearby airports"" but not enter them manually as in the web version ... other than that great app and great flight search engine!"
2012,5,This is a quite useful app with fast results. It has my country and our national airways in the list - something hard to find in other apps. One feature I would love to have - ability to filter by airways company
2012,2,"As with many other flight search apps, it's just good for single trip search and returns with no longer than a month from departure date. Useless for any return trip searches beyond that. Better results from Kayak app."
2012,4,If you can give the prices in local currency and give use to choose currency it will be user friendly. Very interesting application. Gives details of all the flights on the move.
2012,5,"The layout is great, it's easy to use, and I love the abundance of features (e.g. ability to pick ""everywhere"" as destination, or ""anytime""). Easier ordering from the app would be great, atm it just sends you to the airline's homepage, which is often not designed for phones."
2012,5,"This app works beautifully and smoothly. Its easy to use, fast and accurate. Its so easy to use that I no longer find it necessary to look for air ticket prices on a computer anymore."
2012,4,"I find this app. to be very useful. It gives you an overall review of prices, times and lenght of flights. I would change the way in which you input dates though, it seems a bit complicated. Other than that I use it quite a bit."
2012,5,This app is perfect. Nice and polished and works well. Beats Tripadvisor hands down. Finds flights that are cheaper and have shorter stop over times! Very happy :)
2012,5,"Can I suggest a feature? Multiple destinations.. I've two airport in my area and everytime I've to look them separately, it would be great to see them together and choose to go in one and come back from the other."
2012,3,Would rate 5 stars if the price displayed was the price I paid but its miles off.. Says my flight to germany will be 45 quid return but when booking they want 225!! Big difference
2012,1,I am in the USA and I thought this app was great till today I bought a ticket I thought was $387. Then when I  buy it it say ¬£366. In my email. I look at my Bank statement today  turns out I paid $593. dollars. I am mad as hell. I feel lied to.
2012,4,I've not actually booked anything through this app yet but it's been really good and easy in terms of searches and always comes up with the cheapest options it seems.
2012,4,"This is a great app but just be warned before buying that you check the full website as well. We bought flights through the website that never showed up on the app, even when doing the identical searches. We saved ourselves 100¬£ per person that we wouldn't have via the app."
2012,5,Great app. Almost the same functionality as in web version. The only thing that is nice to have is changing the depature/arrival day without returning back on the main screen
2012,5,This app is perfect as it works as it should. I'm yet to purchase a flight through it but it seems to do the job of searching various flight costs just from my Samsung galaxy s3
2012,4,This app is prefect for a busy traveler.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do. Scans the options and helps you book flights quickly and easily across many carriers.
2012,5,"all i could have asked for.. very easy to use from the phone. saves previous/starred searches. various currencies. chooses my location as ""from"" field by default"
2012,4,Great app but needs a urrency interface as prices only display in pounds...not usefull in Africa or US where my last 2 flights were!
2012,5,Can pick where your flying from and dates. App will show you flights to everywhere that are available. Perfect if your looking for a cheap city break. Love this app.
2012,5,"I hope im not jumping the gun sending out 5 Stars now but I have other apps for this purpose and this is the first (so far) to deliver what it's promised. Easy app to work and transitions pretty smooth. So far, I am very happy."
2012,5,Fantastic app. Very easy to use and very helpful in finding great savings on flights. Updates price changes very frequently.  :-D
2012,1,"Software will not start in android, stating that i do not have enough memory internal or external when that's clearly not the case. I liked it before!"
2012,4,"Easy to use, tells me the cheapest flight to other countries and the flight timings.  Would be better if it included the new scoot airline."
2012,5,"I love this app, it helps me find gd deals,since I fly a lot, it come very handy... truly recommend it. ;-) Enjoy"
2012,4,"It's perfect app and very fast. Except one thing, when I select any day for dparture or arrival says internet connection required, even that I have good connection. Fix please."
2012,5,I've never reviewed an app before but was moved to do so by skyscanner. It's so user friendly. It far surpassed my expectations.
2012,5,Really good in terms of flight searching. Best travel app I have used so far. Works fine on my phone too.
2012,5,"Top app for frequent flyers or holidaymakers. Search all flights in an instant without the hassle of looking on all the different airline websites. Better still, search for indirect flights or use the anywhere function to sneak a cheeky stop-over into the itinery."
2012,5,"...exactly what it's supposed to, great app. simple, intuitive UI and no unnecessary b.s. all that earned it 4 stars, the 5th came because it consistently finds cheaper flight options than any of the major travel sites (Priceline, Kayak, Expedia, etc)"
2012,4,"I've used this app only for short haul, but found it easy to work with, an excellent tool for the traveller. I use the main web site always."
2012,3,The date selection should have been easier. Could be great if they used the monthly calendar view.
2012,5,"Vey easy to use and extremely fast on GalaxayS2. The best detail is that you do not have to select the outbound or inbound dates. The scrolling calander is nice, showing you pricing per day. If your flexible this can save much money."
2012,3,Had some cool features as in the search anywhere. But missing things like search day before or after. And no multi city.
2012,5,"I tied so may flight finders but this one beats all the rest hands down. Easy to use, comprehensive and accurate. Kudos to the designers, developers."
2012,5,Omg the best app... so easy and intuitive and great for browsing for the lowest price air travel anywhere. Choice of currencies and location info. It's a must for any air travel!
2012,5,Brilliant to use and better than Web version.  Saved me both time and money...  Fab
2012,5,Absolutely brilliant. Love the feature to see the costs for days prior and after your original date do you can tweak your holiday to get the cheapest flight!
2012,5,Great app! Everything works as it should and I love how it lists all airlines... U get to pick the rate fasterr
2012,4,"I really like this app, it allies me to very quickly obtain accurate and useful travel information showing all of the options available."
2012,5,I just love it! It's so great to have an app where you can compare the whole year prices and you dont jave to search by exact.dates! Altho sometimes it doesn't show some dates' price don't know why but i still love it!
2012,4,Yeh very decent  app!!!!! would be nice too see hotels combined then its a all in 1 travel companion..... Thanks
2012,5,Great app  especially because you can search country to country to find cheapest routes or hubs. Would be good if they could also list prices for flights with one stop. Love this app.
2012,5,"I love this website, and the app makes it really easy to use right from phone. I just wish it was easier to order straight from search."
2012,4,"Look and feel are great, good to see the price graph feature is included as well. Saves your last searches which is handy."
2012,5,Love this app!  Great for flight updates when traveling or meeting someone at the airport.  No surprises on delayed flights.
2012,2,Results never match actual prices when you search. Feels like bait and switch.
2012,5,Booked two holidays off of it so far an amazing app that works every time. Couldn't recommend it more after it was recommended to me
2012,1,"Gives you a price once you click on it, price dramatically changes except on major routes which anyone can find directly. Contacted Skyscanner for explanation and they refuse to comment"
2012,5,Sky Scanner is reliable Ave bit just limited to destinations in the US like other travel sites. The GUI is smooth responsive and fast.!
2012,5,I'm planning an 8 month term around SE Asia and this app is the most useful flight finding app out there.   It gives quick results.
2012,4,Gives you more choices than other apps and allows one to select more destinations in case your destination and or source is in close proximity to multiple airports...awesome app. Can now book an affordable flight on the fly.
2012,4,Great app for finding budget aurline flights with the added ability to search for flights to the whole country and not have to specify a specific airport! Not the most ideal for long haul flights however.
2012,4,Great app. Displays the info you want to see when comparing flights. Any chance of adding in flights via a destination or loop trips?
2012,5,Can't fault this app. Makes finding the cheap flights really easy and is very visual and clear.
2012,5,I don't even fly that much but this is a great app and fun to just imagine going to some great places. Thank you for making a great travel app.
2012,5,"I love skyscanner. Very recently searched and booked flights from Manila, Philippines to Bali, Indonesia thru here and I did it with no trouble whatsoever! Good job u guys!"
2012,4,the price is uptodate. but there are some price in the grafic that are not available.  Should fix it. showing the price not directly book. Must have apps for ppl who travel a lot.
2012,5,Works brilliant. Really helped with booking my next holiday... Keep it up
2012,5,I think this a fantastic app. Always used the web site for several years prior to the app as my first choice for flight search engines. Recommend it to all my friends.
2012,4,"Great for both last minute trips and planning a vacation. I docked a star, though, because sometimes it will show a low price that doubles or triples when you go to book, but this might be airlines, not the app"
2012,5,What a great app. Have been looking for a site to finf me flights from any airport in the UK to my favorite destinations and skyscanner does just that. Saved about 40-50%! Their website as also brilliant!!!
2012,5,"Checks all the cheap airlines as well as the normal ones. Looks at combinations of airlines and gives a chart that shows the costs on various days around your chosen dates, again for all airlines. Makes looking for flights very easy. Great App"
2012,5,Instead of dreaming to go to destinations  I can see whats affordable when! Love the app but dont think  I can keep it my little secret for much longer =)
2012,5,"This app is fantastic, goes through all the major airlines and other booking websites to get really good deals. Perfect for the frequent flyer"
2012,5,"Easy to use, does what it says on the tin. Date picker could be easier to use, but hey it works well as is."
2012,5,finds the bessst deals just about every single time n I use it almost weekly!  Great app for finding flights! :)
2012,2,"It doesn't give you the option to choose the travel class e.g. economy, business, or first class. All other options are excellent, I have given 2 stars because I am a business first frequent traveller"
2012,4,Work well and usefull but note enough low cost companies and prices are often not accurate
2012,5,"This app is extremely slick to use. My first port of call for all flight searches from now on. Being able to pick a destination, then ask it to search all UK airports is a real time saver."
2012,5,I just bought a ticket before I got that app. And day later I've found 200$ cheaper ticket. Though it was for me it might be good time and chance for you.
2012,5,Awesome app! I hardly ever rate apps. But I spent a ton of time shopping around online trying to find the best price. And after my first attempt at using this app I found the best price!
2012,5,Works v.well. Only a small number of airlines dont work properly.
2012,3,If only u can let us change the currencies to our liking it will be great!! Other than that...this app is brilliant
2012,5,Great app! Compares several different flight options and lets you choose the most suitable depending on your requirements.
2012,5,So far doing a great job. Especially love the price chart. I think it would be better to allow flexible search and also go send out alert when price is lower than certain value. Thx.
2013,5,"An excellent app to compare the prices, really neat UI, would definitely recommend to others. Cheers to the devs..!!"
2012,5,"Love the comparison chart, let's you look at prices so easily. Love the fact you can choose ""everywhere"" for your destination and it'll come up with a variety of cities and prices. Nicely designed."
2012,5,"If you are open to being flexible to where you vacation to this app is for you.  Just pick a deporting airport(s) and ""everywhere"" for arriving airports and it doesn't hurt to be a little flexible with you dates too.  And you'll save tons of money."
2012,5,a good start for searching flights... but sometimes it's cheaper to search thru the airline websites... but like I said... this app will give you the clue which airline to start
2012,5,I wasn't able to buy the ticket but it is the best flight search I've seen. After finding the flight I guess I'd have to go to the airline page and book. But I just need average prices por Weeks and got it.
2012,5,Conveniently helps reduce my ticket price with non-direct flight feature! This apps deserve to be reserved in my phone forever!
2012,5,This is a great little app! Its really useful for comparing flights over different days to find the lowest fares.
2012,5,But this simplifies the bazillion options of booking a holiday. 5 stars very well earned...
2012,5,"This is a very good app. Works great,  gives different flights &  cost on different airlines.  Love it."
2012,5,"Serves it's purpose very well. Convenient interface, good functionality, no problems"
2012,4,Just what I've been looking for.  Searches all major airlines and combines them to find best price and least amount of flight time.
2012,5,"Great app Simple to use, user friendly  and very fast with a big choice of flights. Top notch."
2012,5,Works great on the S2. An option to check for multi city bookings would make it perfect.
2012,4,A very good tool for small national airlines as some other flight finders only deal with multi-nationals
2012,1,Money grubbers.  I would simply like to track flights sometimes too.  You know.
2012,5,This app works well. I use it to find cheap flights and check it often to narrow down on the best value flight.
2012,5,Everything is running smoothly. A lot of search options. Helpful tool
2012,4,I have used the skyscanner main website before so was pleased to see an app. Not gone all the way though booking yet but is good for price comparison.
2012,5,Works great!! Hot app if u travel a lot and need to find the best connectio.s tickets etc
2012,1,You are better off searching the internet it comes up with prices like ¬£162 per person and when you click on price it goes up to nearly ¬£500 for two people. Do the maths!!!!
2012,5,Wish I would have known about this sooner. Great find for anyone looking to find great deals on air fare!
2012,1,"If the app is to be supported all the price relevant regular airlines must be included. Sorry, no go!"
2012,3,"Not many options, doesn't show up many flights but can find some good deals"
2012,4,"Great flight search app. Would be improved if the any time search had less out-of-date results, and multi-city search was available."
2012,5,One of the best apps I have seen so far. Works great and the UI is perfect!
2012,4,"If like travelling, you'd better have this app, since you'll know the best fares right away. That's it!"
2012,3,"Generally it is a good app, but I end up checking the skyscanner website anyway,  because last time not all the prices were shown in the app, there was 25% cheaper flight on the site"
2012,5,This is wow.. I have been using this for ages.. I managed to get cheap flight easily through this application. Keep the good work!!
2012,3,Haven't booked a flight with the app but the pricing that it found was pretty good.  Only down side is that it doesn't support multicity searches.
2012,2,Good setup for all flights but the prices they have on there is way under what it is by the time you go to the online site...it would be great to book on here with those prices but you cant so there is no point to it
2012,4,Like it. Makes it abit easier. Alot of flights & accommodation r in one place eventho sometimes the price r a bit wavering :/ but good.
2012,5,This is a great app!! It is fast and I can  Check all airports In the area. Thanks
2012,5,Its my go to app for finding airfares at the best price. Very functional with lots of info to make travel decisions.
2012,5,"Could use a few UI and user friendly updates, but other then that? Perfect little app."
2012,2,Only searches a small selection of airlines. (E.g. Southwest not included.) Definitely not all inclusive.
2012,1,"No good. Can only be istalled for one day, then app says I have insufficient internal memory. Un-installing"
2012,5,Great app. Well written. very clear and intuitive interface
2012,4,Not bad. But there cheaper deals you can find in other web sits
2012,5,"occupies less space,gives accurate results and processes search results fast. really a nice app. keep it up!!"
2012,5,Totally brilliant ! Saves loads of time surfing the net ! Very happy. Galaxy s 2
2012,3,"Used to love this app, now they leave so many of the dates blanked out that you really aren't finding the best deal if you have flexible dates."
2012,5,Really appreciates for who design this application. It helps me save plenty time to look for cheap air ticket.
2012,5,"Wouldn't pay for flights off the app, but by doing the search it can put itself ahead of the competition by showing everything the site does. Great app easy to use."
2012,5,Very user friendly and helpful. Awesome app.
2012,4,I always use this App first before using anything else. Easy to use. Fast and reliable with no annoying ads.
2012,4,pls add the feature of +/- 3 days in search options for flights and also multi round trip options
2012,4,Makes Kayak etc look like a bunch of amateurs. Only improvement would be to be able to search prices for unaccompanied children
2012,5,Lots of features and easy to find flights. Great app.
2012,4,Makes checking for flight timings and prices really easy ... and it remebers your most frequent searches so no need to enter it over and over again !!!
2012,5,"Great to find flights, mainly best for Europe. Slightly fiddly when you need to select a particular time but still top marks!"
2012,5,Five star app. Works better than every other flight search engine.
2012,5,"I love the website and use it all the time so having Skycanner as an ap makes it even better. Still really easy to use and give a good idea of routes, times and dates available."
2012,5,"This Skyscanner Ap has been invaluable while planning a 3-month USA & Canada trip. I find it easy to use, fast & love the graphics too"
2012,5,"Will find flights to anywhere in the world with prices, flights times, flight duration and how many stops. Great for regular travellers."
2012,1,Says that includes low cost and budget airlines! NOT TRUE! It includes only typical common airlines...
2012,5,I just love this app. User friendly and has been a long time fave of mine.
2012,5,"Easy to use app version of the website, very good"
2012,5,They say sliced is great well try this out cos it makes sliced bread look old & stale. Using SKYSCANNER is using a slice of good luck
2012,4,Could give 5 stars if it included more airlines too.  But great app overall.
2012,4,Overall very good. Gets confused when using any day departure in a given month. Well worth having though .
2012,5,I really love your app. Thank you..
2012,1,Its fake and completely BS! Omg just google their reviews!!! Horrible company and people!
2012,5,Works great and quick. Better search for specific time slots would be great.
2012,5,"Very clear, concise and well laid out. Saving your details is a nice touch for those who want to check flights again and again!"
2012,5,Love the app and the great deals.  Better than priceline thus far.
2012,4,Best way to check for flights and prices.  Use the whole month option below the calendar
2012,5,Great app!!! Very helpful and user friendly :D
2012,1,Not worth using... The price chanes on all flights selected right before buying.
2012,4,I love being able to compare prices on several airlines.  Seeing which day has the best fares is also pretty awesome.
2012,5,Cant find any faults so far. Not actually booked anything through it but good enough at providing flight cost and info.
2012,5,You can find prices for several airlines and several dates at once allowing you to choose the best option.
2012,5,Great app. It makes it easy to compare a range of airlines with one tool.
2012,4,I love this app ..  Only issue i have with it at the min is that it gives me fals prises for air transat . Other than that i think its a great app
2012,5,Fast and all the functions of the full website. Works better than normal site on a mobile
2012,5,"The ability to brie a day, price graph makes using this app significantly better than searching on their site. Very good."
2012,3,It tells you one price and then bumps it up by about ¬£200 once you try to book. it is a bit misleading.
2012,5,Excellent app. V useful. Thanks
2012,5,Correct about 90% of the time though it can miss out one or two airlines depending on destination. Still a must have for travel apps collection.
2012,4,Good app.  Great deals.  Simple to use.
2012,4,"Very quick and well put together but doesn't have multiple destination option, therefore it is useless to me."
2012,4,Easy to use.like the recent searches feature. Good download.
2012,5,"Does what it says, fast. Good UI."
2012,4,I love this app. Thank u so much.
2012,5,This site kept me up to date on the best rates and we used all its recommendations.  Saved so much search time.
2012,4,Great features in this app allow you to quickly search for the best options!
2012,5,Need to be able to look for flights more than one month out. Otherwise its great.
2012,5,"easy to use, makes finding the best days to travel very easy for any trip, adds and displays the cost of both to and from tickets conveniently placed at the date selection screen, love this app"
2012,3,"I'll give you five stars if you can make currency other than sterling as the currency is poundsterling, because I live in Indonesia"
2012,3,From other apps plus this one is a bit clumsy. Too many touches required to do a simple search
2012,2,"Not aware it was us currency, didn't allow  cabin class changes, not keen on the roller dates aligning to pointer then pressing done."
2012,5,Good job. I love the 'add to favorites' feature.
2012,5,Previously i was searching for cheap flights in web it will take 45 min but now i am doing in mobile with this app with in 2mins..Thank you verymuch
2012,5,Very pleased with selection and options.  Updates new search results quickly.
2012,5,Flights can be found easily without other ads or stuff
2012,1,Flight prices are not real. They show cheap prices until you make the selection. Waste of time
2012,4,Easy search options.  Easy to use all around
2012,5,"If you are flying at all it is must have app. Easy, quick, free. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2012,5,Best apps for me to plan my trip. Thumbs up. 5 star rate.
2012,4,Easy app that works great!
2012,5,Works well and easy to use. :)
2012,5,Looked at other apps & they only gave certain airlines but this app gave various airlines & found a better price for my daughters flight.
2012,5,I am a taxi driver and this helps a lot. Galaxy gio with lewa rom.
2012,5,i love this app. it makes life so much easier and flights cheaper!!!! highly recommended
2012,5,"Its a awesome app, shows everythin in detail just like on laptop. But 1 cant book it here like v do it on laptops."
2012,5,Found some great deals already. Easy to use..
2012,5,An excellent piece of software.  I travel quite a bit and couldn't do without it. HigHly recommended
2012,5,"Slick, aesthetically pleasing and works well. Impressed"
2012,5,Does what it claims. Ticket prices laid out in an easy to read format. I like this app.
2012,5,"So handy, the calendar pricr chart is Genius!"
2012,5,It is so fast in searching for flights and giving results. It is highly recomended.
2012,5,For what I've used it for it has been brilliant. Easy to use.
2012,5,I always recommend it to friends. I'm sure there is room for improvement but I can't find it. Always on point.
2012,5,Best app ive used 4 r long time.
2012,5,great app. ..simple to use and offers great deals!
2012,5,Quite good. No tech bugs yet. Very easy to use. Clear and fast.
2012,5,I booked my first flight using this brilliant app. Replaces all the hassle of website searches. I like the way it searches all the main carriers.
2012,5,"Very useful app, intuitive and fast.   Thanks you."
2012,3,Just came to know of this and looking 4ward to bookings VERY soon on planned destinations. :)
2012,5,"I couldn't they made something this useful...great app,specially for travellers...  Keep up thw good work"
2012,4,Nice user interface. A lot of information.
2012,3,It skips certain airline companies. Such as alitalia.
2012,5,No trouble with the app. It is missing multiple stops and some airlines. V international based
2012,5,"Fantastic app, essential for any frequent travellers, even if you only fly once or twice a year it's worth getting"
2012,4,"Nicely designed interface, easier to use that the web version."
2012,5,Great app. Saves so much time. Very userfriendly.
2012,5,This app really helps alot. Dun be doubtful to download it.
2012,5,"Fantastic App, really works, easy and practical"
2012,3,Web version more practical & user friendly
2012,3,"I like how it searches all the airlines but many times when you actually click on the price, a more expensive price will appear in the top right"
2012,5,I love the fact that I don't have to know adhere our when I want to go. This app lets you see all the possibilities!
2012,1,Gives you a price once you click on it price goes up 4 fold. Should be charged with false advertising
2013,4,"Convenient but not always correct pricing. Will show a price and then when you search, it changes."
2012,5,Searches all airlines and prices! Great app! Saves me a lot of time and money!
2012,5,"While on the go, I can quickly search and purchase cheap airline tix all from my HTC EVO. I just love this app!"
2012,5,To have the option to set to any day any time  it is gold. Thanks.
2012,4,Excelente! Yiah no tengo k entrar a ninguna aerol√≠nea a buscar precios ni vuelos aki lo tienes todo!
2012,1,Always says no results. This app sucks.
2012,4,"Best flight I've seen so far,  but it doesn't update as fast add it should"
2012,5,It's awesome! Works just like it would on a pc.
2012,5,"Super app, thanks!                          %&-       (%&&***"
2012,4,The app is very good at giving an indication of prices around when you want to fly however it does also give quite a few false readings
2012,5,This app iz fabbb.....     Some apps r really good this app belong to best.nd info. are very exact.....great app..
2012,5,"Very interesting app easy to navigate and unbeatable prise too... 5 star from me, Keep good work!"
2012,1,MISSED MY FLIGHT. Inaccurate flight times displayed. Costly day.
2012,4,"App is OK, but can't give anything but positive review as it is the genius site that is skyscanner, available remotely"
2012,5,easy to access... no need to open lots of site to check the lowest fares! :)
2012,5,Great app for the website... Actually grater platform than the website! :)
2012,4,I am very pleased I don't need to use my laptop or the computer.
2012,4,Find the lowest ticket a for the season. Wish the currency is converted to our own.

2012,5,Really easy to use. The filters are helpful and user friendly. Managed to check a serious number of flights for two people travelling from two different parts of the world. Job done in no time and didn't have a headache by the end of it :-)
2012,5,Found deals i couldn't find online! amazing functionality. Now its the only airline ticket app I'll probably use.
2012,4,Would give 5 star if this would really search all airlines. By coincidence I found out that Silkair is actually missing and they happened to offer the best connection on my route. Now wondering which other airlines it leaves out and why!
2012,5,"One of the best apps I've seen. Fast, user friendly and ver efficient. Works great for Europe and low cost flights."
2012,5,"Excellent App. to check flights and flight times. Have not booked yet but may do in future. If youre planning your next trip then this is a ""must have"" app."
2012,5,"This is the easiest, quickest app to use to find the best fares.  Shows rate changes faster than the actual airline websites so you get an early jump on the lowest prices! Won't use another app again for flight prices!"
2012,5,Superb app.. Have never rated any before but this is fantastic .so simple to use and gives option to book direct
2012,5,It is very easy to use. Detailed info provided. Many options are available. Great app. Thank you.
2012,4,"Great app but can't purchase directly, still have to go to airline website and input information all over again. Good app if you just want to compare prices."
2012,5,Returns the cheapest prices of one way or round flights. Multi city option is not available though.
2012,5,All travel websites should take a cue from this app. Awesome interface to find the right flights.
2012,5,Very easy to manipulate. Very versatile. Comes up with a lot of options.
2012,5,Great app so easy to use and usually spot on with the best deals! I use it weekly and wouldn't be without it!
2012,5,Great app resembling the website that i found quite useful. Intuitive user interface!!
2012,4,"Great app, easy to use. Love the ability to check for fights anywhere based on price. Recommended for any traveler type."
2012,5,Makes finding the best fare for any trip super easy. No more travel agent (and their fees!!) required!
2012,4,Does what it says on the tin. If they added the hotel feature it would be perfect.
2012,4,Works just fine for me . It does what it says . Well done .
2012,5,This app is very useful as I travel a lot!  Can I suggest if we can search by which aircraft we want to travel on? Keep up the good work!!
2012,4,Really useful app. Especially when needing flights for flights back to the UK in a rush.	Brilliant
2012,5,Great job. This app is flawless on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus
2012,5,Searching for flights with different airlines used to be a pain until I found skyscanner. It even copies with Ryanair changes to try and stop 3rd party site searches
2012,2,There is no way to do a one way search. Bad mistake.
2012,4,Good but month long search doesn't seem to work real well when researching international destinations.
2012,5,I regulary fly down to Norwich from Manchester. This app shows me the best prices and times to fly. Fantastic app!
2012,5,I use it frequently for checking the best options for travel.
2012,5,Excellent app. Shows the best deals always!
2012,5,User friendly and with awesomely goos search. A must have for every traveler.
2012,3,"Great app., but if you want a one-way flight, well, you're out of luck"
2012,5,Very useful application. There's nothing can be compared to it..
2012,5,I used scanner to book a flight then went on to the hotel part a nd found a cheap hotel. One of the best apps have seen
2012,5,Easy to use. Reliable. Accurate. Great to check prices on the go.
2012,4,Fast and good results. Only thing missing is multiple cities...
2012,3,great app but cheap flights never come up when you click on them Like they used too
2012,5,Used this loads for work. I travel a lot and for finding routes to odd destinations from even more bizarre points of departure its invaluable
2012,4,I have used this app a number of times and compared it with internet prices and found this to be very competitive and useful.
2012,4,good looking and ergonomic use...love to install this apps on my cellphone
2012,4,But it would be much more convenient if the calendar had grid view.
2012,5,"I live in indonesia, almost all of the local Airlines Can be search from this apps also.. Very usefull"
2012,5,"Very useful, easy to access and will save you time and money. Strongly recommend."
2012,5,Excellent app. Well thought out and brilliantly customisable
2012,5,"Ace site, does what it says on the tin. Quick and easy to use."
2012,5,"Really simple, fast &effective. Saved me hundreds on flights"
2012,5,I got my ticket with $300 off.
2012,5,I really don't know what I'd do without skyscanner...
2012,5,Possible to look all the month cheapest flights...
2012,5,Excellent app. Better than implementation on big kit.
2012,5,I will use this app first when searching for flights...
2012,5,Helped me find my tickets to and from Vegas! Edc!
2012,5,"Best flight search around, hands down!"
2012,4,"Buat cari jadwal pesawat., walau belum semua maskapai. Tapi bolehlah.."
2012,5,Absolutely great ... No more tedious ways of looking things up 1day at a time ...
2012,5,"Nice app,,easy to use, helping aloooot.. :-)"

2012,5,A must for those who travel a lot.
2012,5,"Brilliant price comparisons, saves ALOT of money"
2012,5,Who needs travel agents with apps like this.

2012,3,"Need to add two things in the setting option. 1) ability to choose military time or standard time. 2) change the calendar view. Those are the only items that prevent the app from being perfect. I will check back for updates...if there is none, I'll have to uninstall. Thanks"
2012,1,My searches display results with stops having long layovers even though my filters are properly set.   Seems this app wants to sell flights with the worst connections.  In all instances I went on an airline's website and found nonstop flights FOR LESS than results on this app.  Wonder if the app designers make their $$$ off of selling flights for airlines that no one would typically purchase.  Safe travels everyone.
2012,4,Great starting point to give you an idea of what's available and basic price to be expected. It is a pity that there is no way to discriminate the lower end cheap travel agents that always come up best on cheap flights! After careful checking of a company.I almost booked with I found out so many people had had huge problems with them! That isn't the fault of the program though and I don't know how it would work out the cowboys from the decent reputable travel agents unless there was a rating system?
2012,3,"Not sure how to make this work. The pictures in Market/Play show the app displaying prices for all dates in the calendar. Mine won't display more than three days. I find the ITA app and the Kayak app fairly easy, but this one isn't very intuitive."
2012,1,"But the price results shown are not available on the next step. And this happens every time I look for a flight. The price calendar works, shows prices, but on the next step after select the travel date that price has gone, no available."
2012,1,"Only allowed me to see monthly chart data. No pricing, no dates times or enter button Easier to just use the site Waste of my time and works so well on my phone. Pity."
2012,5,This app is simply the best - makes you wonder why no one else has done it before - instantly see every country your nearest airports fly to within your dates. Absolutely brilliant - this is the future.
2012,4,"Cool app, lets you view schedules and determine dates for travel based on graphing vs. tabled or other style listed booking rates.  But not much good if you have hard dates for travelling..."
2012,3,"Looks like a good app, but having difficulty with the selected date going into the  departure field. It always reverts back to the default date (current), or only the options that are already in the screen."
2012,1,"App is brill, apart from having to re-install every few weeks as get the 'force close' error upon opening. Pls fix. HTC Desire HD"
2012,1,"They do have the cheapest flights and if you are going to buy a ticket and you know you're not going to have any delays then go for it...as for me I was on the way to the airport and the bus that was taking me got into a accident, I lost my flight and this agency wasn't able to help me out, in fact it was no body to talk to and the only person that was able to make any changes on my ticket was a lady from California and the only way she can get in touch with me is via e-mail...it was horrible."
2012,5,So simple and easy to use. Finds the cheapest flights. Particularly enjoy the option of being able to choose your destination as 'everywhere'.
2012,4,The only missing feature is multidestination. Other than that no problems. I would also suggest flight lookup from everywhere to specific destination.
2012,2,"Didn't work via 3G, only via wifi connection. And research by day disconcerting as you have to tap Any Day to see a month view rather than being able to enter a precise date you wanted."
2012,4,You can search for a specific flight or scan months to see the cheapest days to fly.  Prices are always updated.  Pretty great app for those wanting to a buck or two hundred!
2012,4,"Great app, so useful. Only negative is sometimes it tells me the price for one (when it is higher for more than one ticket when you look on the airline's website!)"
2012,5,"Better than searching for flights than most travel sites. Easy interface for checking flight prices, for all airlines, before and after your expected travel date."
2012,2,"In the first search the prices showned are ones and then when we touch to see more details of the prices, the prices are 100 or 200 euros higher!!! Also, when trying to book a flight, the outside links normally don't work"
2012,5,"This is the most comprehensive, easy to use air fare app I've come across.  It found me a roundtrip flight from Newark to Fort Lauderdale for $175. You can't beat that!"
2012,3,"I prefer the mobile website because although sky scanner is fantastic due to it's open ended searching the app way of accessing it is a bit basic - requests location permission but doesn't use it, 8mb seems bloated"
2012,5,i love this app! makes me want to travel more :D i can plan my tours ahead of time or change my mind to the last minute! very helpful:-)
2012,5,"Great app! I use it every time I need to fly somewhere and compare the prices. Been a long fan of the desktop website, but this is much better"
2012,1,"Every serach I put in it says no results found!! Waste of my time, help me or fix problem!!"
2012,4,What a great application. Cos it's all country flight schedule was in here. Thanks.
2012,5,I am always looking for airfare deals and skyskanner lets me search quickly and efficiently while on the go!
2012,2,"Can only select any day,then have to scroll all the way through to find exact dates required."
2012,1,The date wheel doesn't do anything. Can't choose dates so the app is useless. DROID bionic
2012,3,Only good for a rough idea. I find cheaper and less time consuming deals online or with my travel agent
2012,5,"Very easy to use, fast loading, doesn't freeze. All information current and easy to understand. Lets you play about with dates easily"
2012,5,"Beautiful app, so easy to use. Developers should be proud!"
2012,1,"This app managed to find me a ticket for around 1500$ cheapest, and at the local agency, they found me one which costed 500‚Ç¨."
2012,4,"Nice app. Needs a better help/tutorial, but once you get into using it it's really usefull."
2012,5,Very usefull apps.i love the 'everywhere' and 'any day' option very much. :)
2012,4,Works perfect. I would however like to see hotels and holidays search as well.
2012,5,Great quick way to check flight prices. One easy click to check other dates too. Glad I got this app!
2013,5,It really does what it says. Highly recommended if want to track a lot of flight's. To know prices and departures times.
2012,1,Filters don't work & no option for multiple flights. Uninstalled
2012,3,Not showing cheapest prices. Whats the point. For example Expedia has been cheaper
2012,5,Love it! Always a quick sure fire way to see flight prices!
2012,4,Great little app for checking flights. Works well.
2012,5,This is the best app ever! Will never book a flight without checking here first! Definite money saver!
2012,5,Very convenient to purchase from the app and very cheap tickets. Tickets go quick so keep checking back. Best flight app ever
2012,5,Great app. Easy to use. Saved me over $600.
2012,5,Never looked anywhere else to find and book flights. Simply the best travel app I've used. Wicked!!!
2012,5,Before I book any flight I start with this application...
2012,5,It gives the best deals :) love it mucho
2012,1,I bought a ticket on through this and to my destination but what I was to return home they said the flight has been cancelled  and only one way was Paid for when the money wad taken out of my account
2012,4,"Works great, very user friendly!!"
2012,5,"Fast, efficient and awesome.  Forget all other travel sites.  Just use this!"
2012,2,I haven't been able to find one real ticket that marchese the process shown here.
2012,4,Very useful. Highly recommended
2012,5,Excellent. No problems or complaints at all. Recommended.
2012,1,Good app but when I check the website I am getting cheaper prices. Thought they would both be the same
2012,4,its very handy but i do miss the function for being flexible and finding a cheaper alternative.
2012,5,Perfect! V user friendly
2012,1,The date chooser doesnt work
2012,5,"Saves me time and money! I ALWAYS use this app, I don't have to go to multiple websites and this has promos and budget airlines included!"
2012,5,Any update for few transit? Or destination.
2012,4,Brilliant app!!  Very easy to use and quick to find flights availability
2012,4,useful app.. but it needs to clarify some airways logo
2012,5,Great app if you're planning a trip. I saved over $100 using this app and buying at the right time.
2012,4,Really like the lay out but it could stand to be a little more user friendly
2012,1,Does not allow you to enter custom dates on HTC one x.
2012,5,Quick And easy. As advertised. Searches everything.
2012,2,Internet search found lower fares then the app -- why
2012,5,Usually finds the cheapest flights. Checks an incredible rage of sites.
2012,4,Great app but greatly in need of the use of AM and PM
2012,5,"So good, so nicely done. Way better than Web Jet in Australia."
2012,4,"It works great, although I was a little confused about how to use it at first"
2012,4,Will it could also handle multiple location flights.
2012,5,"fantastic app, the best I've used. makes searching flights extremely easy"
2012,5,Just like the web service itself! I do love it!
2012,1,try to pick a departure date other than today  --- good luck
2012,5,Helpful program.. You can search and book flight on shorg time!
2012,5,"Good apps and handy,  no complaints. I would even buy this if I could."
2012,5,"Can't fault it once you get used to hittin back instead of ok, great app"
2012,5,This app is so easy to use and is a great way to find cheap flights.
2012,5,Skyscanner is excellent. A brilliant app to complement the website whilst you're out and about..
2012,1,"No tickets for the number of passengers selected. It says this every flight I press, there is only 1 traveller"
2012,5,Love it! I find it very helpful and easy to use.
2012,2,"Dates don't work other than ""today"" or ""next day""....useless really."
2012,5,Best app ever!  I use it all the time.
2012,5,Definitely found me the cheapest fare in comparison to other sites online. Thanx!
2012,4,Must try this... make life easier
2012,4,This app is great helped me out a lot with my airline tickets.
2012,5,Best app ever. Saves me many hours with price comparation
2012,5,This  is a great App. It helps finding the best flights for where you are going.  :-)
2012,4,Very easy to use/set up
2012,4,"I travel a lot standby, so great for last minute changes"
2012,5,"Best flight search engine by far. Don't waste your time on KAYAK or Hipmunk, this is THE search engine."
2012,3,Not bad. Wish it was better
2012,4,"Love it cheepest flights I've found so far,"
2012,1,The Search function doesn't work on the Transformer Prime!
2012,5,Great app for finding the cheapest fairs and the chart option makes finding the cheapest day easy currency rates not perfect but not a real issue
2012,4,Fantastic little app performs well.
2012,5,"Easy to use app., super helpful! I use it to look up trips for myself, family & friends."

2012,5,A+
2012,5,okies
2012,5,Forget kayak
2012,5,Spot on
2012,4,"Very useful app for searching cheapest flights worldwide. Allows searching all flights with not only a flexible date but also a flexible destination. Adding a map, route planner and route lengths in km would make it ultimately perfect for me."
2012,3,So here is the thing... why make an app for a website if it doesn't offer the same features. Big issue here is you can't break the flight by departure and arrival in separate pricing and times.
2012,5,"Very user friendly. Accurate. The different search options (such as all flights in a certain month, or flights to any airport in a particular country) are very useful. I highly recommend this app. Works great on galaxy s2"
2012,2,Only lets you choose travel for upcoming week. Calendar lets you scroll to dates way in the future but you can't select them.  You are limited to next six days.
2012,4,This is a very good app with an excellent layout. Perfect for quickly checking fares.  Wonder why multi city search option is not provided.
2012,1,Stuck on February. Can't change month/date. Tried reloading. No difference.  Time to uninstall.  Maybe later.
2012,1,"It gives you bad rates, I got a much cheaper deal by just looking at the Internet. It also keeps running in memory despite on being killed."
2012,5,"I've found it best to find your flight, then go to the airline's website to check if you can get a better price - very often you'll save something. Beware that cheapest is not necessarily the best (in terms of quality of the trip - I personally hate spending 2 days on a trip, sleeping on the floor of transfer lounges, hidden expenses, etc. To try and save a few $."
2012,5,Custom filters that allow you to keep your search quite broad initially to find lowest price flight and then refine search. Can't fault it.
2012,4,"Searching for ""Any"" day in a month doesn't respect the airline filters I have set. If not for that would give it 5 stars."
2012,3,Was working fine until the most recent update...froze the calendar...pick your own date option is no longet working..
2012,2,Downloaded because I want to plan the summer? Nice layout but only let's you select ates in the upcoming week...
2012,5,If they could add multiple stops in travel trip for ppl who want to travel different places or from one trip to another in different time.. such as- pdx to London for 2 weeks then London to Russia after 2 weeks then back from Russia to pdx.. my point is going from point A to B for sometime the point B to point C for sometimes then from point C back to A. Like a round trip but from different place of entry..
2012,1,Useless on.android. Cant edit dates. Pretty basic requirement for travel planning not functioning
2012,5,"I can put in a point of origin and ""Everywhere"" as the destination AND search an entire month.  This gives me the opportunity to book a fare when I don't really care where I'm going.  Awesome!"
2012,5,"I am truly amazed at the quality of this application. Found flight s not listed by the Big air search engines, saving me literally hundreds! A+"
2012,2,Never shows the right price anymore ....... Used to be the best flight planner site..... Please fix...... Back to cheap tickets site for now ...... When working its a 5 star app
2012,5,Great app! Things become easier and more efficient! Thanks!
2012,3,"Good application,need little improvement to be perfect. It is very difficult to set days"
2012,5,I recently missed a flight and was told my inflexible ticket meant I needed to pay ¬£400 for the next flight. This app saved me ¬£250 in 2 minutes flat!
2012,5,Fare is shown in all currencies including Indian Rupees.I have just seen it and modified to Indian Rupees.Very very useful and user friendly.ThanQ for giving this great application for free.
2012,3,Good app - once you figure out that you need to use back to select the date you've scrolled to. Not intuitive
2012,5,"the most flexible air travel search system, lets you specify geographic areas (countries, continents, etc) rather than just cities"
2012,5,Really good app.Did show all the options for my search!
2012,2,"Unable to select my own dates in the calendar, therefore no good unless you want to book one of the dates already displayed."
2012,1,"Can choose only from given ar ""any"" day. Can not confirm own dates...."
2012,5,This apparently saves me soon much time and money. Way better than that boring kayak.
2012,5,I booked plane tickets from a hospital emergency room waiting area.  Easy.
2012,4,Very accurate and very versatile but if you install it on tablet you will get different result???
2012,5,Excellent - has always worked. I have saved hundreds. My first choice for comparison.
2012,5,Works just as you want it to keeps a memory of your trips and future trips
2012,5,"Such a good app just watch the prices it shows up initially, sometimes they are lower than you can get"
2012,4,An  above average app Have been using both the pc intenet website and the android for many years & found it extremely useful
2012,5,Super easy to use and search results of all different airlines....juat makes life a little easier when it comes to planning a travel vacation!!
2012,1,"Date selection doesn't work for dates other than today, rendering the app useless."
2012,5,Excellent app. Very quick and remembers your details from previous check allowing numerous daily checks for changes to prices
2012,5,Works perfectly for me.....everytime
2012,3,"The lastest update broke the date selection for departure/arrival, you can choose a date but not confirm that selection."
2012,1,Cant change return date.   Galaxy s2
2012,1,"my internet was connected but when i run this app it still says ""internet connection required"""
2012,5,Its d best tool for flights findings and best prices
2012,1,Kind of fundamental for a site like this!
2012,3,Hard to book through app. Misses some airlines on some searches
2012,5,Very well laid out and is idreal for looking at great fares from losfs of airlines..one of the most handy apps ever!
2012,4,Good app recommend it.  Doesn't search southwest airlines
2012,5,Awesome app. Helped me to find cheap and accurate airfares.
2012,5,"Fantastic app, really easy too use and fast too. Would recommend."
2012,5,"Good solid app, finds great deals you wouldnt have found otherwise"
2012,5,"It is a very good app, I use every time I need to fly"
2012,4,"Fast, easy to use competitive prices ! Great apply."
2012,3,"the website is much easier to use, hence i just use that."
2012,1,Impossible to choose exact date except today
2012,4,Not always accurate but it's still great for an aggregator app like this
2012,5,Simple awsome. No more time waste online looking for flights.
2012,4,Very cool app works good and is quit accurate.
2012,5,"From now on, this will be my first (air)port of call."
2012,1,"Custom dates can't be accepted, only AnyDay and other buttoned options"
2012,5,Great app.Makes all my domestic and international planning easy. SG2.
2012,5,"Great, nice for info but I still do bookings across other avenues for ease&less limitations&rules."
2012,5,"Simple, concise. Best app i have!!"
2012,5,Superb program this is the best way to flying. And to order tickets
2012,5,Never let's you down Keep up good work!
2012,4,Looks good so far!
2012,5,"Handy app, can save you valuable Euro's."
2012,5,I don't give much five stars but this app is great so far!
2012,5,Use this all the time and have found flights that I wouldn't have checked otherwise.
2012,5,Absolutely brilliant. Dont look for ultra cheap fares cos airlines keep them for themselves
2012,5,But the new logo looks borrowed from Soundcloud ;-)
2012,5,Great app! Travel agent on my tab 10.1 :-)
2012,5,Used this app 3 times to get my  Flights found it excellent definately be using it again
2012,4,easy to use.but there are better deals out there

2012,5,I especially like the search buy any data feature.
2012,5,Excellent ap found cheap flights to europe and usa.
2012,5,"I just love the info, helps each time i have to travel"
2012,5,Easy to use once you use it 1 or 2 times!
2012,5,"Nice and cheap, what could be better :)"
2012,5,"Im amazed with this apps, how easy and helpfull Must have apps"
2012,5,It worth the 5 stars  But need more airline

2012,4,Worked well for me
2012,5,Ideal!
2012,5,Works with small airports
2012,5,Optimun
2012,4,"I love the website and the android app works just as well. One improvement would be if you could narrow the search to show only a few departure airports, or choose eg ""any North"" rather than trawling through results for all UK airports."
2011,5,"I use it to plan my trips between Sofia and Vienna and I've always found very good offers. I tried various services in last 5 years and I know Skyscanner scans all available options.  Even if you are paranoid like me and hesitate buying tickets online from your phone, you can simply send search results to your email and buy from your computer. One of the most useful apps on my Android!"
2012,4,Love this app. It's helped me out alot. Just wish they could give you the option of changing the time from military to standard.
2012,5,"The application saved me so much time and checked all airlines, including budget airlines! As others have said, you are able to check flights for any date in advance. Just turn the date and month dials to your desired date and hit the back button on your phone. It keeps that date selected. It's a perfect app to check flights on the go!!"
2012,5,"Ok, it's just an app that searches for flights. However, it has a rather lovely UI, is quick and seems to turn up every possible flight. Couldn't ask for more really."
2012,5,"Great app. I realised though that you don't show flights that are full. Can this be an option, so us crew can still find flights to jumpseat. Cheers"
2012,5,Looooovvveeeeee it. Nothing like skipping out on a 4day pass to see the wife in Kentucky all from my phone. The digital age is taking us to new heights
2012,1,i love skyscanner but this app has room for a lot of improvements.. specialy on tablets. the date selection functionality is a pain!
2012,1,I tried to book for more than one destination and it does not have options. Do not use.  Its worthless.
2012,4,"Can't select dates beyond next month option,on Galaxy tablet. Hope you can fix that.Otherwise is quick and easy."
2012,4,Seems to find way more options than many other flight planners I've tried.
2012,5,"Very good app, i have used it to search for my holiday and it works very well. Keep up the good work. Thanks"
2012,1,"Where is euro option? I find it throws up some crazy flight details, taking you way off your route."
2012,4,The best program that I have found. Sometimes a lot easier to use on the go to find a cheap flight. I like that it checks all the sights including the airlines.
2012,5,Great interface. I love they way they sort the prices in a bar chart manner. Good job!
2012,5,Amazing! So simple to use and has given me the best deal quickly :) easy to book as it directs you to the booking site online
2012,5,It has a quick search option and very good user interface. Best Flights Booking App I have ever seen...
2011,5,"Love the explore feature, and the prices are the best every time. Don't bother with another flight search app, this one has what you need."
2012,4,"Nice, clean app. Never actually booked a ticket using it, but it makes for a great reference, if you want to get an idea of how much tickets might cost."
2012,5,Very possibly the slickest android app I've tried. This is gonna make them a lot of money and save us a lot too.
2012,5,Easy to use n get all info at once. no need to search on other website again. Work nice on my TF1   Best flight searching ever !!!
2011,5,"This app has helped me way more and way faster than any website on a computer, and finds fantastic deals! :)"

2012,5,"A very useful and simple to use application. (Galaxy Tab P1000, South Africa)."
2012,3,"Can't downselect flights by times (only morning, night) and no multi-city look-up. Kayak is better"
2011,5,This is an amazing app. To know the lowest fares n flight details on Android.
2011,5,great app. ....saves you so much hassel.....must have if you are an air traveler.
2011,5,What an Amazing app. So informative & user friendly. Stryker - GS2
2012,4,"Cool app. The only thing that I would change is the filters: you have to go ""back"" to see them and it's a bit confusing"
2012,5,Everyone that says you can't go more than a month out is WRONG ..ALL YOU DO IS SET THE ROLLING THING ON THE SIDE TO WHAT DATE YOU NEED AND PRESS BACK! ; )
2011,5,"Very good app for finding the cheapest flights for any date.  Highly recommended if you want a simple, easy-to-use airfare app that will get you the best rates."
2011,4,Great app. Just missing the explore option that you get in apple version.
2012,4,"Brilliant app does what it says.on the tin.. But badly needs multi city otherwise best must.have app.for those who travel ,!!"
2013,4,Its good but its annoying when you want to change a parameter yo the search and have to go back to the search page. Overall very happy with it.
2012,1,"Will not allow me to search for flights beyond February, yet I can do this on the website. What am I doing wrong?"
2012,4,Dont know how accurate the search is but it does work well.
2012,4,Great app. Would be even better with cost shown in different currency options
2012,5,Found the best flight to Thailand. The monthly view tool is extremely handy.
2012,5,really easy to use. Great way to find the best deals.
2011,5,Way better than Kayak and others. Shows all flights that exist and the local currency support os awesome. :)
2012,5,"I have downloaded many of these types of apps, and this is been the best one. It would've saved me time and hassle on the ticket I just bought."
2012,4,Most options for budget flights.. keep it up guys :)
2012,5,"Super easy use, at first i doubt it and even double checks with the local website. Now I'm confidence with its reliability"
2012,4,Had a pretty good experience...just wish they would have told me I had to pay for my only bag...haven't flown in a while and just didn't...good thing I had a few extra bucks to cover it...
2012,3,"Doesn't seem to find regional airlines, such as Southwest.  So cheapest flight listed might not be cheapest flight available."
2012,5,A very resourceful app. Good to be able to have this type of info  at my fingertips. I enjoy using it.
2012,1,cannot choose a date on the galaxy s2... pointless.
2012,5,It's really helpful when you don't know what the dream means you can just have this app and don't need to look for answers online.
2012,3,Does the same jobs as sky scanner online. Would still like to see multiple destinations functionality added.
2012,1,"I thought this app should find the flight information, but never find anything I want with airlines, date and airport all been given."
2012,5,I use it to check flight prices on the move. Very easy to use fast and great display of information
2011,4,works great in Galaxy S2....fast response
2012,5,sky scanner is one of the best apps out there. Bravo!
2012,5,Used to check multiple sites for best value.  Now I just use this.  Brilliant
2012,3,Check memory usage over time. It grows and needs to be cleared. Mine reached 20 Mb.
2012,5,Excellent app. Very user friendly and Intuitive.
2012,5,But keeps uninstalling on its own. Please fix this!
2012,5,Works nice and fast.  Very helpful!
2012,4,Never had any problem with mixed up airports our anything as is the case with a lot of the travel websites
2012,5,"This works so well, great app."
2012,2,"Doesn't include Southwest Airlines, appears to cater to certain airlines."
2012,5,Works well in my xperiax10. Great app.
2012,5,"Excellent app, cuts out a lot of the waffle and gets in with the task"
2016,1,What have you done? Why change a perfect app. Uninstalled!
2012,2,Does not let me select individual dates or change passenger numbers on SE Xperia arc.
2012,5,This is an awesome app. All info at fingertips.. Keep it up !
2012,3,good app but need more options in flight path eg. able to choose multiple or alternate route
2012,5,Must have app! Top quality! Thanks!
2011,4,Good reference app. Would be useful to be able to select multiple destinations across multiple countries for a single search
2012,1,Cant understand the fare..plz provide indian rupee also
2012,4,Seems to pick up all the major airlines but hope they add some more.
2011,5,I love the app but i cant seem to pick a departure date other than one month in advance. Anyone else having this problem???
2012,1,Can't even change dollers yo pound what a crap android app but its better on iphone
2012,4,Used and found it very good. Handy for ppl trvlng alot
2011,4,Selecting custom dates and value not clear cut. Should have a select button like preset values.
2012,5,I really love the ability to find the dates with the cheapest prices. I wish the app would be less heavy memory wise.
2012,4,Not clear it is saving dates with small grey box in top left. Does not save sometimes.
2012,3,Needs a multi-city option.
2012,5,I always liked skyscanner so this app is even an easier way to use it wherever i go and need to check my travel options.
2012,5,I use the normal website all the time but this app makes finding flights really easy on your phone.
2012,4,"easy to use, defo finds best price flights really good."
2012,5,found flights the agent couldn't. great app
2012,4,Great idea. But all flights are not always listed.
2011,2,Can not correctly working with some SE asian airlines and airport codes
2011,5,Excellent... works quickly
2012,5,Simple and accurate. Just need to add an average ¬£50 booking fee and baggage per return flight for true price.
2012,5,I travel alot and only used it twice and it didn't disappoint. Helped me pick a very cheap flight.
2012,5,works just great.

2011,5,The best i have ever use!!! Its so simple to use I wish i could give it more than 5 starssssssss!!!!
2012,5,Really easy to use.  And I seem to find pretty good fares.
2012,4,But not easy to compare total journey times and connections.
2012,5,"When needed, every time it does its job with perfect alternatives."
2012,5,"The app looks very good so far. Wonder how it will work, when I try to book flights via it."
2012,5,Great. Does exactly what it says on the tin with no hassle!!
2012,5,Skyscanner consistently and reliably offers best price and value for money flights. Now I dont book any flights until I have checked skyscanner.
2012,5,Seems to be great.  haven't cross checked it against the internet but seems to be good.
2012,5,"I use this App to get the cheaspest possible flights accross the globe, and it delivers time after time!!"
2012,4,Nice apps to find cheapest airline tickets
2012,5,No problems. Working very good. Easy.
2012,5,"Great app, saves trawling around multiple websites to compare prices Even does the UK budget airlines as well"

2012,4,"Easy to use, the best flight comparison i know!"
2012,4,Only thing missing is being able to book directly.
2012,5,This app is fantastic. Don't leave home on a plane without checking this.
2012,5,Excellent search engine. Allows multiple searches simultaneously!
2012,5,Great app for finding the best cheapest flights. Good choices of how to filter your searches too.

2011,5,Last version took 20mb of phone memory although installed on SD card. Had to uninstall some apps in order to run it. Have no idea why it needs such hu
2011,5,"Needing to fly places, at times being re-routed mid trip... This app saves me time, money and headaches. With my boarding pass sitting on my phone."
2011,4,"Definitely download the updated version. 100% recommended, they have added the really amazing price history, so you don't need to go back and forth."
2013,5,Used this app on my old iPhone and was blown away by its ease of use and comprehensive results. This is the app I've been waiting for since switching to Android - Fantastic work Skyscanner - THANKS!!!
2011,5,"My go to app for finding airfare options.  It's quick, simple to use and searches several travel sites for the lowest fare in seconds.  Love it!"
2011,3,"Great when it works, why won't it let me actually 'select' departure dates? Am I missing something. Abuse to a minimum please...R"
2011,4,A great app.But i can't set the options for class of travel as i want to book biz class.¬†Also can't search for one way only with no return ?
2011,4,Wow! Great Application for finding the best pricing on airfares and easy to use too. Love having this handy tool. Roz
2011,5,"Would love options or even associated apps for car rental/ hotel. Easy UI. Quick, as good as any site I can use from a desktop for flights"
2011,5,Love the spinny iPhone style date selector. Graphically beautiful and an absolute dream to use. Many thanks.
2011,5,This is an awesome app. It finds deals not on priceline or hotwire all the time. I just bought a round trip to Boston from Tampa for 220
2012,4,Grat app for last minute flights. I can't quite get to grips with the calendar but I guess it will be fixed soon.
2011,5,Great app.  Save searches for easy searching at later dates. Quickly check prices for same flights occurring on separate days.
2012,5,My favourite flight search app. So easy to use and looks really good too. This app has saved me hours searching around for flights!
2011,5,it actually find the cheapest deals. Best app ever. Sometimes chart wont loat but it is great
2011,1,"As a tool to search and buy tickets, it's good.  As a tool to save money it's unreliable as it displays different results from skyscanner website."
2011,5,"I've been using Sky Scanner since I learned about it during a trip to Europe in 2010. Compares not only the airlines, but also different travel sites, like Travelocity and Expedia."
2011,5,"This Airline App is hands down, the best I've EVER used. It's better than going through the "" Airline's Web Sites.""   :-)  I am one happy person."
2011,5,Works great. Still need to book ticket through this. Search is great.
2011,5,"Great app Easy working Useful  ... One of the best app. Big thanks,"
2011,5,Am I stupid or can you not change dates?  There is a wheel with an no way to select another date!  This kind of makes this app useless!
2011,1,"Hopeless, I'm trying to track a flight now that I know has taken off two hours ago, yet it still does not show on the app."
2011,4,"finding good price tickets works fine, could use some other search possibilities (Business, price limits)"
2011,4,"Seems a bit bloated, and sluggish. If it lost some weight and gained some speed - 5 stars"
2011,4,"My only complaint is it sometimes uninstalls itself. Otherwise awesome for finding airfares, etc!"
2011,5,Really good and easy to use. Very quickly find cheaper flights and giving options for bookings.
2011,1,Finds flights for which seats are not available. Waste of time. Uninstalled. There's better on the market.
2011,4,"If you could also search a  region.. (asia, africa.. Etc) i would rate 5*"
2011,5,"Great app and doesn't crash or give constant search errors like Kayak. Only flaw, it doesn't have price alert."
2011,5,I like how you are able to find the cheapest flight with the shortest duration times anywhere. So easy to use.
2011,4,Its a very good application with real and reasonable listings! I use it always!
2011,5,"Love it, great app . Though it devours my battery."
2011,3,When I use date wheels there is no 'done' button in the top right corner. So they're no use.
2011,5,"The best app out there for keeping an eye on flight deals, love it!"
2011,5,"Works very well, easy to use. Highly recommended"
2011,2,I can't set / confirm exact date of departure and arrivals (seems like a bug) and therefore the app is useless for mr
2011,5,Most useful. It can source flights for you at some bloody cheap prices. I highly recommend this app!

2011,5,The best of its class. Well done.

2011,4,Great app. 4 * only because of lack of multi city/destinations search

2011,5,"Very good, fast and helpful. Thanks."
2011,1,I can't get the app to set the departure date.
2011,4,Very good app. Unfortunately does not have all of the functionality of the iphone app.
2011,3,give the option to do 12 hour format instead of military time and this would be five stars
2011,4,"Is it possible to search for other categories like premium economy, business class or 1st class to make it a great app?"
2011,4,"I would recommend this application for any one who needs good information on flights, pricing and times flights are available. !!!!!!"
2011,5,Brilliantly simple yet has everything u need function wise. Better than any online services
2011,4,Everything is good only issue is selecting date got the travel plan otherwise 5 star.
2011,4,Shows more flights on specific searches than 'make my trip'.
2011,5,I thought I was pretty savvy when it came to buying flights online. This proved me wrong.
2011,4,"Nice, Simple n Handy App. Everybody who is travelling frequently should have this."
2012,4,Gives a good range of alternative flights and journeys!!! Nice job
2011,1,Useless app-can't update or uninstall orig to reload.

2011,4,Simple to use. Great app. Only one small suggestion. A date range feature could make this even better.
2011,3,"I like that they now have the Everywhere option, but search is painfully slow. Doesn't make sense that phone search is slower than web."
2011,3,"Ok app, can't look up airport codes so you need to know them, haven't actually purchased a flight thru it yet. Prices almost seem to good to be right"
2011,5,Easy to use. Has a smooth interface. very complete app. It also includes low cost airlines.
2011,1,This used to be a good app but after the most recent update it has used up pretty much all available phone memory (but not used any SD card storage.
2011,5,"Awesome! Very impressed... easy to use, find flights in under 1 minute, love it!"

2011,5,One of the best app i used.. So simple to use.. So feature rich.. Skyscanner probably the best.
2011,5,I wouldn't use any other application. Flexible search features.
2011,4,This a nice app. I love to have it on my phone. Very handy app.

2011,4,i like it.
2011,1,Never working
2011,5,Does what it says.
2011,5,I like this app
2011,5,Sangat bagus
2011,1,"This is well written app, importunately flight search result costs are ridiculous. I-d say x2-x4 times higher then you'd get with a google search.  I got about -1000$ difference on Cheapoair. This app doesn't have all the deals in, they seem to have contracted with most expensive flights. not worth my 7mb of space.  /uninstall"
2011,2,"I expected more after all the great ratings.  There are a number of airlines not included in the search results, and I could find better ticket prices doing a search online.  I suppose if you are in a jam and all you have is your phone, this would be great.  If you are a savvy shopper, there are better deals to be found outside this app.  ~Samsung Infuse 4G"
2011,5,"I gave this 5 stars based on the superb UI, even though it lacks one feature I would like to have included, that is an open-jaw round trip search (fly to one city and return from another). That is a minor quibble.  The app is a joy to use, with very intuitive and easy to make selections.  The designers deserve kudos, especially since it is a free app. It also nicely accommodates tablets, in landscape or portrait modes."
2011,4,"I've found it really useful, and I really like how it lets you select any UK airport to help find the cheapest flight. You could however update the date select screen as its a bit clumsy to have to select and then hit back. Also, works well on Honeycomb"
2011,5,Very fluid UI and it is easy to use. Displays a very detailed overview on flight details and costs for a long period or a very specific time frame. Above all else the ease of use tops the rating chart in my opinion.
2011,5,This makes loooking for cheap tickets incredibly easy. There's a calendar chart where you can see what days are cheapest to fly are. A must have app!
2011,2,"Potential, but atm useless, as craige said earlier...  Can't check future depart times.  I'll keep it installed and await updates."
2011,2,App is great. Too bad you can book a darn thing. Links with getaway air thats only open m-f. Thanks but no thanks. Uninstalled.
2011,2,"Cannot plan more than 2 months into the future. Although direct routes is not selected, it cannot show different options to complete a full route."
2011,4,Its good but it dosen't give business class option. If dose how I don't know. But any way it's very helpful.
2011,4,Extremely well designed interface. Very simple to use. Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because I'm not able to clear my 'Recent Search' list.
2011,4,Looks up flights and prices nicely...quickly.   Add the option to switch different day quickly a day back or forth and you get 5 stars.
2011,1,"Previous version worked fine, this one's UI is frustrating. Once I play the slot machine to.tediously select a date, I can't pull that date back!"
2011,3,"Skyscanner does provide an easy and accurate way to track flights from your phone, but some of the information is incomplete.  Not all flights present"
2011,3,App is good as android app. But the flight price is not cheap. If you run the same query on some other comparison web sites like travelsupermarket
2011,5,"This is the best app on my phone! Fast and very good,very useful. No need to search individual airlines, this app does it for you in seconds."
2011,5,Great app! Very smooth and intuitive interface and easy to use. Looking forward to when hotels and rental cars get added to this app...
2011,5,"For my requirements, finds all flights expected plus some new options. Quick and easy, saves hours trying to find the right flight."
2011,5,Love this app!! So easy to use. And some of the best rates feature. If youre a regular abroad its a must have!!
2011,4,"Powerful search tool, efficient layout, easy to use. A little disappointed I was sent to a Web page to finish purchase, though. Great tool."
2011,5,All the airlines and flights are there. Good ui. No ads. Great to see this now has the flexible date and flexible destination search. Very cool.
2011,2,"When editing filters or search preferences there is no 'enter' or 'execute' button.Sometimes the back button works to save your selections, not always"
2011,4,Why don't the filters apply when looking at the chart? I want to know what the cheapest days to fly with a certain airline are! Thanks.
2011,4,"Nice app, but room for improvement.. (One the reasons up have this app is so I DON'T have to call Southwest for quotes..) Get Southwest on board, well"
2011,4,"Samsung Tablet: works a dream. Will have to give it more of a bash before giving it a 5* rating, but so far so good."
2011,1,The option to select specific dates doesn't work at all on my Asus Transformer running Honeycomb 3.
2011,5,Functionality is great but it's the comprehensive search engine that makes this app gold.  It's has saved me countess hours of trawling the net
2011,5,It is like a one stop for searching my desired flights! The UI is great and the sorting and filtering are awesome! Great job!
2011,2,"It's neat, but needs more airlines... Everything is pretty high within the ones it has loaded... Travelocity and orbitz plus others has better rates"
2011,5,Really well designed and intuitive. Have been looking around for a good flight app. Great on HTC Desire
2011,5,"Brilliant stuff. Very clear, to the point. Fabulous filters, very user friendly n easy to operate. Full marks :)"
2011,2,"But will have to uninstall it as, it doesn't compare with any cheap air lines, can get a flight to Kuala Lumpur for half the price on another airline."
2011,5,"Incredible, always finds the best offers. Could have some kind of notification to let me know when airlines have deals on my preferred routes."
2011,2,In turkey there 6 airlines at least as far as i know. However it can only find the flights of two airlines. Prices don't seem to be realistic.
2011,5,and please add it with indonesian language further..
2011,3,Good UI. Better than Google's ITA software. Could improve in some countries like India.
2011,2,I could not choose departure and return date at all. Prefer the previous version
2011,5,Great app.....this is a nice app. For checking out prices and times of flights from any airport...._ right from your phone.
2011,5,"VERY nice app, I love the ""chart"" feature! Helps you see the best dates for the cheapest flights"
2011,4,Great app but billing country option does not seem to work. Booking is still over UK even if I am not
2012,3,"Very good but would be nice to see prices for more than one airline on each selected day, not just the cheapest on the monthly view."
2011,4,"Quick and accurate - much faster than a pc, but does not show extra charges like like credit card fees and carry-on baggage charges. Ilove it."
2011,5,very useful. hope in the future we can search flights for a certain period to find the lowest fair. keep up the good work
2011,4,"Great start, better than most others but not like a web app. Need to be able to bracket travel days to view alternate fairs"
2011,5,Too good an app if you are a frequent traveller... Must download... Galaxy tab P1000..
2011,4,I fly two to three times per year and this app gives very close prices as advertised online. It's nice that Skyscanner compares multiple Web sites.
2011,5,Very helpful in finding best deals on flights instantly. Works great in Samsung galaxy S2 and galaxy tab 10.1
2011,5,"A really great app. Complete, friendly, smooth, all you want is where you expect it to be. Thanks!"
2011,4,"It's a lil slow, but other then that the results are impressive and I'm flying out to NY in 2 weeks and I'll use this app to buy my tickets"
2011,4,I'd give it the 5th star if it offered alternative airports where no flights exist. (e.g. London has 5 different carriers use different airports)
2011,4,"It does the job, no crashes yet... A search of travel agency prices would be nice as they sometimes are cheaper than the airlines."
2011,4,Great app and idea. Love the open destination. Would get 5 stars if I could do the same for the dates.
2011,5,Perfect application. Provides travel options. Keep it up!
2011,2,Does not scan all flights.  If it did Southwest Airlines would be listed.  Description from developer is misleading.
2011,5,Great app.. Wish it had the multiple destination option.. Though it still deserves 5 stars
2012,4,"Very user friendly, without annoying ads. Highly recommended !"
2011,4,"Great app. I found two great fares for a very low price. Also, the ability to share the link for the fare is very helpful."
2011,5,Thai Air canceled both my outbound and return. Skyscanner helped find the most expensive alternate flights to to be rebooked on. ‚ï∞_‚ïØ
2013,2,But constant fc make it unusable. Galaxy S2
2011,5,The most useful android app to user who usually travel for vacation or work. Two thumps up!!
2011,1,"Absolute waste of time. Wouldn't allow input of any ""From"" location, didn't recognise gatwick, heathrow, london, manchester, north west & midlands."
2011,4,"Fantastic application, it gives a recent informations and I  don't needs to go an agent before I can get the latters flight fare and it good, helpful."
2011,1,"Expensive , can't find any flight to some part of Europe even , such as Kaunas, Lithuania from Birmingham and London Luton. Useless"
2011,5,A rare thing. An app that does exactly what you want combined with an attractive user friendly interface.
2011,3,"Great simplicity.... sacrifice price savings. Found better, cheaper flights on priceline. $100 cheaper. No bueno."
2011,4,Great app. Consolidates flights from different airlines. Just hope they filter sold out flights for faster transactions.
2011,1,Extremely poor UI design. Not possible to select return date (android)
2011,4,Very agreeable UI. Works in my country too. (india)
2011,1,Won't let me change departure date. Useless. Samsung Galaxy S.
2011,5,Wish I'd had this app a couple of days prior to making my upcoming holiday bookings; would've made considerable savings. Runs gr8 on my SG I I
2011,5,"This app is fast, accurate, & user friendly.  Keep up the great work :-)"
2011,4,"Seems accurate, simple interface. Very handy app."
2011,4,"Good application but it's missing some countries currencies like Saudi Arabia, it will be better if include additional countries."
2011,4,Good app you can choose ur flight with no hassle and u can also go back anytime and have ur settings not moved at all
2011,5,"Great App 5*, sooo much better now you have added the ability to search to anywhere! Must have for both Techies and Travelers alike!"
2012,3,"Getting there. Would love to see the ""Everywhere"" and search by country options included."
2011,5,Great app. Works every time. Thunderbolt
2011,5,I used it more often than I thought I would!! Great app. Easy to use. Not cluttered at all
2011,5,Great app. Gives you all options for trips you could think of.
2011,5,"For people who loves to arrange travel with cheap flight, this is very useful! Instantly fall in love with this."
2011,2,No way to apply filter before getting price estimates for diff dates makes this app less useful than most competitors.
2011,5,Amazing easy to use and thorough. A delight to use considering other available apps. Get this!
2011,5,"If i cud rate more than 5 stars for this app, i would..so simple to use and undeniably convenient...Very Impressive!!"
2011,5,great application. for my country indonesia to small city. top recommended
2011,1,Can't choose a date from the calendar. Either I'm being stupid or this app is crap.
2011,5,A must have app for frequent flyers. It showed flights to almost all locations which i tried to search. go for it.
2011,1,"After I enter no and type of passengers, I can't use the info to search cos there's no 'enter button'."
2011,5,Love this app. So easy to use  specially the sorting features.
2011,5,Unbelievable!! Even searching on pc wont be this fast! Img omg omg
2011,5,This app is easier than using the web to find flights! Highly recommended!
2011,5,"This is by far the best app for flights ever! Great job, easy to use! Very impressed"
2011,3,"It should include southwest, they got some pretty good deals online, definitely cheaper than the ones provided by this app"
2011,5,Great application! Easy to use and simple. HTC DHD
2011,5,It really does find them all. And the prices are the best around. Compared to kayak prices.
2011,5,"The best plane ticket booking app I've seen. Searches through budget carriers, takes you straight to booking page."
2011,4,"Very useful, easy to use. Would be better if you could select > 1 airport"
2011,5,Awsume application so far... helpful in searching flights in easy way.. shows the best prices among all...
2011,5,Great App Well done. Fantastic makes life so much easier. What about some more apps.
2011,5,Melhor op√ß√£o que j√° vi para buscar v√¥os! O √∫nico que permite ver em quais dias as passagem s√£o mais baratas! Recomendo!
2011,1,"Definitely not. Southwest just one ""small"" example. Uninstall."
2011,5,"This is what an app should be...incredible, easy to use, straight forward, even a kid can use it! Wowed and impressed!"
2011,5,This is the best app. looking for the right plane ticket price!! Easy to used!! :D
2011,5,Best app ever to find flights.. can compare between airlines. Great! !

2011,5,"VERY helpful app! Flying to London April/May,found 2 seperate flights saving more than $200!"
2011,5,"Very impressed.  Extremely comprehensive, but easy to use and intuitive.  10* app."
2011,5,Awesome!!! Now i can easily to find a cheap ticket airplane. :D
2011,3,Should be able to search by airline specifically. Also didn't come up with southwest
2011,1,Junk... Results shown are not available when you try and book.. uninstall
2012,5,So good and really quick. User friendly
2011,5,Recent update is awesome. Must have app!
2011,1,"returns ""no results"" for every destination tried, both domestic and international."
2011,4,The only change I would like to see is having standard time displayed rather than military time.
2011,3,The date selection wheel doesn't work. But the rest seems ok...
2011,5,"This app is convienient, great results. Thanks."
2011,4,Nice app. Could have additional functionality (flexible dates & alerting)
2011,1,I have tried on many occasions to book fligjts and it keeps coming back with no results
2011,4,"Very fast results, and very easy to use.  Need flight tracker and search history"
2011,4,"This app is very competitive with the most popular travel websites, and more convenient."
2011,5,This is the best app. I like it. Thanks for the developer.
2011,5,"This app is great, working fine on my galaxy pro, helping me to find cheapest flight, make my schedule more efficient"
2011,5,"Great stuff, loving it Finally an app which does exactly what it should at a great speed whilst being easy and comfortable to use and looking awesome!"
2011,5,Why u check comments? Don't waste ur times... Just installed.... Now...
2011,3,If only I could share flight with k9mail...otherwise does the job
2011,5,Good interface and better search. The best fare
2011,3,Definitely can find cheaper prices in Net but good for comparing!
2011,4,Easy to use as a guide & look for flight schedule
2011,4,My only complaint is that flight times aren't listed as AM or PM...
2011,5,Works well in Asia too
2011,2,"Nice design,  but nz jetstar is missing. No good."
2011,1,Tickets were more than $300EACH SEAT.....WTF.....  Fine if you want to pay to much.....
2011,4,Very nicely laid out. Way better than Kayak app.
2011,1,I'd like too be able too choose a date beyond their selection
2011,4,Huge improvement.  Just wish you could search within a radius like onthefly.
2011,4,Great app for those who looks for flights without using the computer.. :)
2011,2,I use this and 'OnTheFly' app and 'on the fly' seems to search more airlines and give better results.
2011,1,Enough said
2011,4,Good app. Not sure the purpose of the graph since it doesn't work.
2011,4,Diverts u to another site to make the booking. But the results are good.
2011,2,Thought ALL airlines would be included.  SW not listed.
2011,1,Completely leaves out Southwest. Not even close to the lowest domestic price.
2011,4,Great flight search. But some local airplane not list at search result.
2011,2,Very poor when trying to search dates in future. Couldn't get it to fly out Dec and back Jan.
2011,4,Its d one who to get best pssible route and time for your next departure
2011,5,I luv it. Works like a Charm!
2011,5,So far the best app in this category. Searching for flights was never easier.
2011,4,"Flight n price from Cathay Pacific Airline is incorrect, other than that, great app."
2011,4,An excellent app for frequent travellers. More currencies should be added.
2011,1,Crap only brings up very expensive flights. Useless app
2011,2,Doesn't display low cost airlines on search
2011,4,"haven't actually purchased tickets thru it yet, but it's very useful!"
2011,5,Just easily enter your info and then wait just a moment to see your choices (which are plenty).
2011,4,Would like to see Southwest Airlines added.
2011,5,"Very fast, very accurate, very good. One of the best App"
2011,5,Do all its say it does .easy to work. Recommended

2011,5,Awesome. I like thus app a lot found better airfare I a major than my local airport.
2011,4,Feature request: destination is a customizable set of airports
2011,5,Simply great app.fast and accurate.more cool its free! :)
2011,1,I don't fly that much Who ever heard of flying from iowa to texas with a 5 hour layover I think that's a little too much
2011,5,Absolutely very nice app.i can find any flight fares from my country or frm any country to any country.. Superb...
2011,5,"Simple, fast, checks them all. A must have app."
2011,5,This app finds airlines I didn't know existed. What a way to find flights without going to a bunch of sites.
2011,3,Would be great if it included hotels and car rentals too
2011,5,"If you're working in an airport or a frequent traveler, this is a must!  Excellent work, developer!"
2011,5,A genuinely useful app. Helps you find your flight wherever you are.
2011,4,it is quite confusing when you must reverse to accept settings with date and with amount of passengers.
2011,5,"Very clear, smart and easy to use!"
2011,1,"NO results, NO Southwest, NO reason for me to keep this app.  Will be uninstalling!!"
2011,3,"Excellent app,now I can get great fares anywhere"
2011,5,Wow awesome app. Best flight search hands down!
2011,1,Searches kept returning no results Just wasted my time
2011,5,Gonna rate it 6 stars. But it only can 5.
2011,4,Found additional flight options to edinburgh scotland on BA for $30 less than found on BA site by including travel options with a second layover.
2011,4,Have found some cheaper online but not by much
2011,3,"If it add a multi-stop function, it would be wonderful!!!"
2011,4,It's really good but doesn't tell yu the right dates

2011,5,Great software.. amazing.
2011,5,"Excellent job, but need to increase database and to include chartes, and i would give it six stars if possible"
2011,5,Finally an app which searches all airlines instantly and allows sorting by price and time. Beat the line up when flights are cancelled.
2011,1,But none of them have any tickets available....wtf?
2011,2,Only does the big five... Kayak is better
2011,5,Makes searching for flights so fast and easy!
2011,4,Only one problem that the fares are not always updated that quickly

2011,5,"Great app! Simple to use, and great results! If you like the website (which is awesome!), then deciding to install this is a no-brainer. Although it's obviously aimed at phones it works well on my Asus Transformer, although I really hope to see a tablet-optimized version some time soon! The iPhone app has been out for a while, so it's really good to see it on Android."
2011,5,"works on galaxy tab 7"". Ticket prices may not be very accurate, at least the flights database is impressive. Needs real time flight tracking on map."
2011,4,The app found cheap flights easily. Too bad you cannot purchase the flight from within the app. It send you to their web site which is clumsy on phone
2011,4,"Good app, quite quick findings. Would be useful if sort by airlines be an option. I'm using it time to time for quick comparison :)"
2011,4,Easy to use and nice interface. just needs to have a flexible date search to find cheaper flights. Apart from that it's great.
2011,1,Clearly connected to the internet to be able to install and submit feedback but search says I'm not connected. Seriously? Great app? Hardly think so
2011,4,This app is simple to use and seems to be connected to almost all commercial airlines. This makes this tool very useful to have. GREAT APP!
2011,5,Awesome n super user friendly!!! Jst Wat I needed.. tells u flights so u cb make informed travel decisions..
2011,5,Has so many airlines (options) very easy to use and connects even small cities directly to international destinations. A must for planning any trip.
2011,5,"Fantastic, remembers destinations, you can even switch origin and destination, best in breed! Very stable, use it for all my travel planning. HTC Sens"
2011,4,Good app. If you add more option like (multiple destination).thanks for your effort
2011,5,Great app. Fast and produces lower prices than one competitor app I used for a year. Great UI too.
2011,5,"Excellent app, very easy to use and feels entirely native to Android. Great for searching international and domestic flights within Australia."
2011,4,Need ability to see month in advance and cheapest price for a month adding value for leisure travel. Business users don't care price anyway
2011,1,"I went to book a flight for $160, they told me the price was wrong and tried to charge $350... They wouldnt honor it and when I called they hung up"
2011,3,Did not find same flights as webpage. Not as slick as iPhone version.
2011,5,I used to buy my plane tickets through Expedia or Hotwire... how come I never used Skyscanner? I bought my last 3 flights using this app! Amazing!
2011,1,Outbound flight is set in military time..inbound is set as regular but it dosent say whether its an a.m or p.m. flight..uninstall..
2011,5,"Useful, works well. You can scan all flights and buy tickets within the app!"
2011,4,"this app is cool and gives you everything you're looking for, but I'm only giving it four stars since you can't search flights using flexible dates"
2011,4,Good app.. but please improve it because there is some airline does not appear in certain routes.. eg for CGKDJB
2011,5,Always finds me the best deal everytime. No need to check any other site.
2011,5,First time I ever saw the need to rate an Android map!! It is truly excellent...I'm going to be flying a lot more !!
2011,5,Superb app. Works well. Designed well. Will save you money! Thank you.
2011,3,"Love this app, but its far too bulky (even when I save it to SD, my phone complains about no space) regretfully uninstalling"
2011,5,"Fast and easy to use! I really like that it saves your recent searches! It would be nice to check a whole month, but otherwise excellent!"
2011,5,Excellent app! Works just like the website. Nexus S
2012,2,No where near as flexible as online facility. Can search flights for the whole year. (boo).
2011,5,Great app... try it if you travel... it shows you so many options.
2011,5,Fast. Fluid. And user friendly. A must for frequent flyers
2011,5,Put me on the right track to finding the best deal.
2011,5,"Would be good to filter on arrival as well as departure times (just an idea, doesn't detract from the quality of the app)."
2011,4,Very good app. But hey i'm missing something or the Pound is the only currency available?! Please fix.
2011,3,Would be 5* if it allowed you to search a month or year like the website as I don't always know my exact dates.
2011,2,Definitely not the lowest airfares!!! Averages $300 over cost if I called the airline directly! Uninstall
2011,4,Works very nicely on my Droid Brick phone.
2011,5,Fantastic app! Used it to book flights with no problem.
2011,5,Simple to use. Much easier than using the web page on your phone.
2011,5,Next step would be to add customisable stopover points (by departure dates) to avoid having to go back & make multiple searches.
2011,4,but the andriod version should have the chart just like in the iOS. 5 star if its better to the other version
2011,5,Wow. Really good. Seems a bit big for what it does but great usability. Very simple and efficient design.
2011,5,execelent application allow u very econamical search and thats why u no need phone to travel agent .thanks
2011,5,"Really goos app, works fine. UI is very good and friendly."
2011,2,"It struggles the minute it looses connectivity, and you have to start from scratch. Not good I'd you are in a train or an area with bad reception."
2011,5,This thing is amazing. I love playing with the dates like a slot machine. Highly recommended.
2011,5,I book flights all the time. I used to use the Skyscanner website. Not anymore. This app is great.
2011,5,Great App.. Love it.. Works Perfect in my HTC EVO 4G
2011,1,Doesn't allow tracking of flights like ir said it does. Not user friendly.
2011,5,Has helped me get stranded friends home. Easy to use. Great.
2011,5,Does what it proposes and does it very well. Remembers your last input which is very handy.
2011,5,"Very easy to use, great interface. Galaxy S"
2012,5,The best website/app around. I book all flights through this. Highly recommend.
2012,5,Does it job fast. Easy to navigate thgoug dates. Thx
2011,5,Great app. Doesn't have all the answers but comes close. Saves loads of money.
2011,5,"Excellent application. Easy to use, simple interface."
2011,5,Very nice! Finds cheapest flight in no time. Just great!
2011,3,"Works well,but would prefer to have suggestions for all airports of a given city and the possibility of searching and pricing return flights.Uninstall"
2011,5,amazing app.. this is a must have for travellers.. domestic flights are also covered
2011,5,"Sorts through all the airlines and gets you the flight details, my only gripe is I havent figured out how to save filter preferences"
2011,1,Never any search results... Crap app. Dont bother!
2011,4,"Haven't booked a flight yet, but so far good. Once I've booked a flight I shall give a 5‚òÖ"
2011,1,Unable to add from/to destinations on my galaxy s (android 2.3.3)
2011,3,Interface still a bit clunky.
2011,5,Easy to use. Accurate. In depth. Great app!
2011,5,Really Great App... Thanks to the developers... :-D
2011,5,"I found this app while checking for flights on line it is great!!! It remembers your information, so you don't have to reenter it"
2011,4,"I like it it helps alot searching in many flight and sites , hope they improved to show discount flight in soecial day . Thannks"
2011,4,Only one thing missing... Searching whole months or whole year flights
2011,4,Very good. Would be even better if it could manage multiple stop overs.
2011,5,Great low price finder Great app for finding low cost flights while on the go with many flight options to choose from all with the lowest fares compar
2011,5,I love it!The interface is easy and simple and definetely helps a lot!Thanks
2012,5,Works perfectly on desire hd
2011,1,I can't select the departure date so this is waste of time
2011,4,Great app. Could maybe do with showing you when or where close by you could get direct flights once searched.
2011,4,"Very handy app where price info is concerned. However, prices are lower on direct with airlines website."
2011,4,Very handy to have. Remembers most settings but not the filters.
2012,5,Awesome Great app works great!
2011,5,Excellent way to search flights. The only one I use right now.
2011,2,Needs a option for round trip and a search for dates around a date.
2011,3,Although OK. The iphone one looks much better and well designed.
2011,4,"Just missing the ability to save search defaults, otherwise it'd be 5 stars"
2011,4,Great and fast. I checked against kayak and it does really well.
2011,4,Easy to use and just like the full site always finds what you need.
2011,5,Best flight App available. Recommended. :)
2011,3,Good but found cheaper flights by searching myself.
2012,5,"Great app and fast, though some flights seem to be slightly cheaper on competitors' app. But this app is still my first choice."
2011,4,It would be even better if you could search one way trip.
2011,5,"Excellent Application. Very easy to use, very well thought out shortcuts and very fast."
2011,5,I'm just an aviation enthusiast but I love this app. It does what I want.
2011,5,What a great app...very pleased and happy that i can check on the go and it loads a lot quicker than on the web :-D
2011,5,Really good app possibly even better than full website. Filters are really useful!
2011,5,"Very easy to use, room for improvement. 5 star"
2011,4,Super simple! Automatically searches all sites!
2011,5,"All the airlines possible are searched, quick accurate results. Necessary app indeed!"
2011,4,"Use them all, like this the best"
2011,5,"A must have app! And free too, as tony days grrrrreat!"
2011,5,I do like this app i look at it all the time to see whats about. For family
2011,5,"Always loved skyscanner been using for years on pc, now it's mobile, excellent!"
2011,5,Would be even greater if it can provide best price by alternative flights in different days with user give the days range.
2011,4,Good but i think some times miss flughts...!
2011,5,"Very helpful, functional and fast. Simply nice to have."
2011,5,shows ways to save money on booking fees by giving direct line to airlines
2011,5,"Great app, use it quite often to find the best flight deals."
2011,3,An all along month search option is needed...like on the web site..
2011,4,The more I dig around in the app the more useful quirks I find.
2011,5,I would like to say this is my first times ever using this and its great will use more .
2011,5,"Excellent application, well put together,good man yourself!"
2011,5,"Awesome extension of the site, Scottish company also so bonus!"
2011,5,"Really easy to use and great, quick way to compare flights."
2011,1,Won't detect network connection
2011,5,"Easy to use and very quick, great app!"
2011,5,Fast and easy app with all the info u need when searching for flights
2011,5,"Excellent app, easily source best flights using it"

2011,3,Why can you not look at prices for a month with the app.. One of the best features of sky scanner.. If you could it would be a 5
2011,4,Great app! I would rate it 5 stars if it would be possible to search for the whole month like you can do on the website. Much appreciated otherwise!
2011,5,"It is brilliant, works like a breeze. Thanks for making free, please keep up the good work. AGMGLOBE"
2011,1,"Doesnt work on zte blade android 2.1 opens but cant search for cities, also no option to search over whole month"

2011,5,Very straight forward. Perfect as a quick checker. Use it always ;)
2011,3,Very nice but misses 1 crucial element for me. Why can't I not search for a whole week or month???

2011,5,"Instantly does what you want, easy to use. Really good translation"
2011,5,Really useful and cheap ways can be found. Like wishes I recommend to add a 3 points trip.

2011,3,"The app is quick responding...nice clean interface...and the call booking feature is really cool...but haven't quite understood why it requires 8.7 MB...even after being moved to SD, it takes up 3.6 MB in the phone memory...shouldn't take that much space...even if it's trying to store the names of all the airports!"
2011,4,"Good app! I wish i had found it sooner. Would be even better if it had some xtra features, e.g. promo deals, alert, etc."
2011,5,"Fantastic app, love the way your search is remembered so you check quickly. Would be nice to have option for all London airports, like website."
2011,4,Great. Thanks for the android version. The latest iPhone updates are great so hoping and looking forward to them being incorporated
2011,1,"OK, but with less functionality than through a browser, since whilst you can search for the cheapest for a given date, you can't do whole months/years"
2011,1,"Can't get any airports, countries at all. No results...please help!! Android"
2011,5,Fantastic app! Works like a charm and lists every airport and destination I can possibly think to search for.
2011,4,"I've been waiting for this on android. Great, can now delete crappy kayak"
2011,3,Move to SD! It's way too big. Doesn't show times of connecting flights! Please fix it!
2011,5,Very fast and very accurate! Really good app! Galaxy
2011,1,Can't search for fares in a whole month and no multi-city. Not worth the download. Use web site instead.
2011,5,Absolutely amazing and great to use. Love the iphone style carousels. You wont be disappointed!
2011,5,Really great app. It covers all flight in any country. And the price is also accurate. Love it..
2011,4,Excellent app! Just a shame you have to leave it to proceed the booking...
2011,4,"Remembers your searches, which makes it much quicker than going on to web site. Good"
2011,5,Great to get this out on Android. Well done all.
2011,4,Good but really needs something like search for prices for eg a month or a week as you can do on the website
2011,3,"Good app, but needs better controls to filter on time range.."
2011,4,5 stars if you can search destination as everywhere like on the site. Otherwise solid app !
2011,4,Didn't work on first install but ok second time around after removal.
2011,5,I really do find the cheapest tickets with this app. Thank you!
2011,5,Really good app to bad some of the flights arent cheaper but hey!! Thats not there fault.

2011,5,Very usefull
2011,5,Really good
2011,5,"Finally, thank you guys !"
2011,3,Changelog?
2011,5,It does the job
2016,1,"Its way to over ""pretty"" now. No graphs showing future prices anymore. Difficult to get the information you want. Keep it simple, keep it clean. New version a big fail in my opinion. Shame, was one of the most useful apps I had. In fact the 729 Airlines  app has it nailed. Plus it finds cheaper flights and the price remains the same when you go to book it instead of teasing you with a price and then inflating when you go to book it like this app does. Roll it back guys, newer is not always better."
2016,1,"This used to be my go-to app for searching and booking flights. I loved the calendar view and all the options it came with. Since the latest major update and facelift, I find it extremely frustrating and not user-friendly at all. So much so, that I have stopped using it and am considering uninstalling it. It's a shame really..."
2017,4,"It is a nice useful app, but it needs refinements. I used it to look for flight for more than a month and booked through it. It would have made a great difference for me to be able to have an alert on price for flexible dates around those I chose. Instead, I had to recheck every possibility each time. The principal problem is regarding cost of flight. First, flight prices kept changing because of currency. Second, it assumes every airlines as being equal and rate them on price, while a few of them don't offer baggages and food in their price, so you will end up paying extra with those airlines, while some of the more expensive options would have ended up to the same price, since everything is included in the shown price."
2016,1,"After the recent update, new version is absolutely unusable. Instead of getting clear and concise information now you are watching pretty pictures of airplanes, vacation destinations and hotel adds. Used to be a great app. Now it's a colorful toy for teenagers. Besides, the prices stated have no relation to reality. Uninsalling."
2018,1,"This app used to be great but now they allow these predatory travel sites 
to advertise FAKE RATES just to get you to their website and collect your 
info. It's EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING to keep finding ""deals"" that don't exist. 
This should NOT be allowed on your site/app! I hope you fix this soon bc 
you will definitely lose users."
2016,1,This was always my favorite app for finding our next adventure. Since the update change it has become useless to me.  We would always search everywhere and anytime as our schedule was always flexible and we were excited to find our next unexpected trip location based on rates.  Now with the new updates this app is of no use to me!!...PLEASE FIX IT AND RETURN IT TO THE GREAT APP IT ONCE WAS!!!
2018,1,"FRAUD.DONT FALL FOR THIS.THIS IS A SCAM. Booked a flight from happyeasygo 
which was shown by this app. They didn't book my flight and haven't 
returned my money either. What's worse is I called them 10 hours before the 
flight,and got to know that they didn't book it because they said the 
airline company's rate was higher.I was left stranded in an unknown place 
with my money blocked in their stupid transaction. Don't fall for this 
scam. It might work for some but it's not reliable. Use more authentic apps 
like Cleartrip which infact gave me a much better deal with an earlier 
time,but had to call someone for money."
2016,1,"Thankyou for your reply. Firstly you can't type 'everywhere', you have to scroll down the page and then your can't choose price by country, you have to scroll through every city on earth. On the second point you are wrong. I would suggest opening skyscanner on your phone browser and app and see which is easier to find something... your mobile webpage is better and is what the app used to be..."
2016,3,"I used to swear by skyscanner, and still do find the website to be great, however recent updates have led me to become frustrated with the app- it's no longer possible to look for one way flights, and the ""everywhere"" search option only works sometimes. As I'm currently traveling around the world, the one way flights is a deal breaker for me-I don't buy round trip tickets. Additionally, looking across wide time spans for flights has gotten flashier but less useful, by skyscanner showing only some prices"
2016,1,"This is really an update that is trying to fix things that aren't broken. Now, the one thing that it needs to do, find the best flight rates, can hardly be done anymore. It's getting sooo complicated and the prices shown in the results are really never the correct prices. Keeping things simple seems very hard."
2016,2,Yes the new version has pretty pictures but it's now functionally useless. Skyscanner's USP was the ability to make ONE search easily over a range of airports over a range of dates then pick the most suited. Try to do that now and you find the simple functional interface that allowed you drill down to the best date/price has been replaced by a few random search results. Multiple searches are now necessary making skyscanner the same as all the rest.
2016,1,Oh no; how frustrating when my favourite and most useful app ( I'm a frequent flier) turns into a piece of cr*p. ¬£900 to fly London to Glasgow and no flights at all next year from London to Brisbane. I don't think so. You will lose a serious volume of bookings.  Oh and you most the bar charts showing nearby dates. One of the best features of the old version
2013,2,This could be a good ap. Problem is can not see a price for simple search.  Like Denver to KC. Developer probably could figure it out if they input info but average joe like me found app useless. Maybe they should go to a mall and ask total stranger to try and do a search. That way they can see how it functions for 1st time user.
2018,1,The feature to search for flights by the cheapest dates is not available in the app. That's literally the only reason I'd use this app over all the other similar apps. They've left out the one thing they had going for them.   Also the email address listed to contact them isn't valid.
2017,1,I unistalled the app because it keeps opening itself without me clicking on it. Specially when I leave the phone for some minutes and I come back the app is opened. This must be some kind of trick for you to use it more. I turned off notifications but it will not stop. End of the story with this service.
2016,1,New update includes hotels and car hire which I'm not interested in. Also when you want to search the cheapest flight from your location it now only shows you places nearby and annoyingly shows every airports price. Not just the cheap flight for that country like it used to. This app now sucks.
2016,1,"Each 'update' seems to make things worse. This latest one the prices aren't accurate and they even show up cheap prices for routes not even available for your dates selected as click bait. The website is the same now, guess I'll be moving to Google flights."
2015,1,"Unfortunately, you had a very intuitive app and decided to radically revise this... for marketing reasons, new UX designers, or basic need to reform. But got it wrong. Sometimes needs time for users to adapt, get over change resistance. On this occasion, that is unlikely. For eg., the price, arguably most significant data, now fades into background. How do I time box my departure or arrival time now??? Smart enough to made great app, am sure you can fix it!"
2015,4,Since i updated to android 5.0. This app doesnt correspond at all n just stays black screen. Nt happy pls fix this n i wil give 5 stars... recent update fixes my problem n works ok now 4 stars
2013,1,Would be a great app if the prices were accurate. It lists all of the airlines and their prices in the search results but then when you click the links the actual prices are so far off it makes the app useless. You wind up having to look at each flight and airline manually one by one and take notes of the prices to figure out who has the cheapest fare when this app is supposed to do that for you to save you the time. Waste of space.
2015,1,"Since the new update, I now am unable at a glance see the cheapest flights. The bar chart without the cost is crazy as you have to click on each individual bar whereas before you could see the cheapest flights around the date you wanted. What was a great app is now less user friendly, I hate it"
2018,2,"Deleted the app because some of the travel agencies used are suspect. I 
received daily notifications of fare changes every time from an agency call 
HOP2. After researching HOP2 found out they don't advertise live fares. So 
how are they changing daily? Also multiple complaints about fraudulent 
credit card usage after purchasing through HOP2. I was unable to filter out 
fares from HOP2."
2015,2,"I've used skyscanner for all my flights for a couple of years now. It has been simple, informative usually accurate. The update is more complicated to use, provides less information in the month view and the indicative prices seem to be way off. I hope the desktop version is still useful."
2016,1,"We used to love this app for finding cheap flights to anywhere. I'm not sure what this app is good for now. It's not a good flight search app, this much I know. It doesn't even show all the available flights. I can only assume the original creator sold this app and the new owner is running it into the ground."
2016,5,"The app itself works fine - if i can find it?! Its never on my phone, only way i can get onto it is by going to play store, finding it and clicking open.  It seems to be unsearchable on my apps page and theres no app icon to touch.          ***edited***                   app needed an update which i wasnt able to do as when i clicked update i recieved an error message saying app was already installed. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Now have an app shortcut on my home screen too. 5 stars now"
2016,1,Deleted it straight away can't find a flight and hate not been able to view the deals straight away.  Yes update your app but not to the point that it's Completely changed. The old app I could find a bargain and plot when I wanted to go when it was cheap but this app it's too long winded
2016,1,"I always use the website to start my flight searches, but this app is awful! It doesn't let you search for cheapest month to travel (you have to specify a date). I thought flexible flying was the whole point of this site!!!"
2016,2,"Oh dear, what have they done! This used to be such a slick app, in fact one of the best examples of efficient UI design. Sadly no longer... I can only imagine they've changed app developer as it's such a big change, and very much in the wrong direction :-("
2014,1,"Uninstalled, it might be good for some one that needs a flight in a pinch but it does not have enough options for me. I wanted a one way ticket there was not an option for that. Then i saw a cheap price but when i tried to get the information it was not accessible. Thanks though good idea."
2011,4,"Picks up most airlines and flights, including ones not on Saber.  Better than a travel agent.  Also cool if you fly to remote places, can see all direct flights to, from that airport. Some annoying interface issues, but well worth it overall."
2018,1,"Lame app...had it in my phone for a long time. When I finally had to use it, it showed me no flights between two major airports. ""Check your internet connection while we check our servers"" is all it had to say. Uninstalled."
2016,1,"I once used this app constantly but then I got a new phone and used the browser for a while, now I just install the new version, tried to search for flights and uninstalled it promptly. Perhaps the way Skyscanner can avoid embarrassment would be to offer the old app as Skyscanner simple or something similar then you can slowly pull support from this app which it seems nobody likes."
2018,3,"Unable to filter out air asia from search. However,filtering out vietjet works. How come? I've had bad experiences with air asia, so don't particularly want to see their flights at the top on each and every search I perform. Same story for both app and web (air Asia is unfilterable!)"
2017,1,"You can find cheaper flights by searching manually. My advice to travellers is to search for flights through each airline website, use Turo for car rentals, and airbnb for lodging. The cheapest airline from my airport was not even listed as an option :^)"
2016,1,Prices shown in the app do NOT show what flights cost. Once you filled in all the details on the referring websites prices all of a sudden jump up. In my case from 400 to 2000 pounds with a message if you still want to go ahead and buy the flights.
2016,5,"I LOVE Skyscanner! It's my main go-to travel site, mainly because it gives a wider range of travel dates to combine and compare for the lowest price. Plus I love the feature of getting a daily list of updates on my chosen dates...whether rdtrp or 1-way."
2013,5,Just downloaded it and it found heaps of flights with so much ease. It searches for months in advance so a quick swipe moves along weeks with a great graphical user face. The price found was the exact same as on the airlines website.... I checked after. Fantastic.
2015,1,"I select a flight, get redirected to some ""transgenio"" site for booking. After I give all my details the price is 200 euros higher. I cancel promptly. Next day they have the attitude to send me a mail offering a 10 euro discount! This site and app should be investigated by the consumer protection authorities for abusive practices"
2016,1,"You absolutely killed Skyscanner, now it is like any other app. This used to be the best app for searching for flights. The Everywhere or the from Whole Country features are gone. Charts are gone. Whole month search is gone. You are a regular flight search engine now. BRING BACK the old Skyscanner!"
2017,1,Dollar rent a car did not honor our pre paid booking through economy bookings. Out the $354 I paid. Did not get a car. Disputing the charge. My bank will be involved. Poor service. do not use.
2018,2,"MUCH worse than the website.I need to use the browser because the application is very limited.I can't choose the best month for a travel, or using the whole month research I can't see the prices of each day but only colored dots and I need to click on each day to know the price.If you don't need to departing in a specific day and time Skyscanner can let you save a lot of money...but the website,NOT the application...this one it's useless without the same features."
2017,1,The app has wrong prices for flights and the websites that you use to book increase the price if the flight. It is not the first time use the app but today I payed 190‚Ç¨ more than the real price without noticing it. I hate and I want  refund for my flight.
2017,1,"It kept giving me the wrong price for the flights.  Every time I tried to book a flight through them when it redirected me to the Web site the price was different.  It was more expensive.  When I got alerts about prices going down, it was also inaccurate."
2014,1,SGS4. Running Kitkat the official Samsung OTA firmware upgrade.  Returns the above error when trying to login via FB. Have uninstalled this waste of time. Apple iOS version works soooo much better!
2012,4,"This is a great start but it would be helpful if there was a filter added for layover airports.  It would also be helpful to have the layover points shown without having to check the detail.    Finally, the app I really would like to see is one where you could enter a specific itinerary on a specific airline and have the app continue to check the airfare for that itinerary and notify me when it goes down.  Some airlines will refund if the fare drops after you bought, so this would be helpful to monitor that.  Otherwise, great app."
2016,5,I always use Skyscanner to book all of my flights because I'm never able to find them cheaper anywhere else. Also the app is so easy to use.. I especially like how you can choose open bookings instead of specific dates
2016,1,The exact same flights we're over $20 higher with the app verses using Google flights and going directly to the airline. Obviously they say no commissions but they increase the price put it in the face and that's how they get their Commission
2018,5,"I love this app! Not only for cheapest flights, but because how it's made. Wonderful animations when click on airline, plane icon at the action bar which is changing  it's direction, ""good to know"" section, Explore part, etc. Nice UX and UI, really love it! Greetings to the designer, hope one day to work with team like yours :)"
2013,1,"This app used to include United Airlines. Now that it excludes them, you will NEVER get the best overseas flight prices. All their prices for other airlines are a minimum of $300 more. This is too bad. I used to use this app for all my trips. Now I am uninstalling."
2015,2,"Poor information. For example, Singapore return Shanghai on 16 Jul to 2 Aug, App showing cheapest flight of SGD104 but actual search give Malaysia airline at SGD463. Same to all return flights from  Singapore to China, the different between app and actual search differ by multiple times."
2017,5,"I have been looking for flights left and right, always showing up $300+ for one person! But this app gives me what i want for $130! Cant get better than that. I found what i wanted and its all thanks to SkyScanner."
2013,1,Builds up your hopes seeing those cheap flights only to find out they don't exist. or they are much more expensive. Tried searching for the same flight for three days and Skyscanner was still giving me a cheap non existent price.  Deleted the app!
2016,1,"I do not understand it ,when I first installed this app multi city just seemed to be standard. Now I can not find out if it is possible. Or am I doing something wrong. A real shame if you can not search multi city options. Thanks Dave H"
2017,1,"At the time of searching on skyscanner, it shows a price... but at the time of checkout, the main booking websites say ""The price has increased, you can book another flight or continue with the new price."" What a 3rd grade system, that's unable to show right prices !!!!"
2012,1,"According to this app, there are no flights from Hartford, CT to Chicago, IL on my selected date.. I know there are dozens of flights every day between these two locations, and have in fact found several on my travel date, through several other services. This app is worthless."
2017,1,u have to scroll a lot to find the cheapest flight they show more irrelevant. Incase if a person wants to travel he will try to take the lowest price and shortest time but the site shows longest and absurd rates no setting for same
2012,1,"Hi, I'd love to install this but after I download it, it gives me a couldn't install to SD card or phone error message despite there being enough space available at either location for the app.  Any ideas how to fix this?"
2015,3,"Really I don't know how this app works cuz I don't got it just replying to the military time thing its really easy all you do is for instance 16 you always subtract 2 so is 16 subtract to you got 14 take away the one that's what you got for 4 o'clock, for   twenty subtract two you got 18 take away 1 u are left with the 8 hence 8   o'clock & then of course 2224 830 whatever but you just always attack 2 and you get to 23 you know that's one way from 20 / 12 the 11th"
2018,5,"Some years ago Kayak was my go-to traveling price matcher, today Skyscanner steals the spotlight. I just wish they would give the option to  shop flight+hotel+car rental together. Is that possible?"
2016,1,"Needs my identify, no thanks.                            Update;  received email  (see below) but identity is still required on installing app. Have not done so."
2014,1,"Comes up with lack of space despite me having 23gb spare. I tried the tip about checking ""don't keep activities"" but it still can't find any airports. Have reinstalled several times but won't be doing so again until you sort this out."
2017,4,"On the website I can reduce the limit on evening departure time. Why not in the app? Also the calender is not useful. The give ""green"" price ranges like ¬£150 - ¬£450. Damn.  That is not the same price at all."
2016,1,"Before you tottaly changed your app, was simple, useful and helpful, now is easier to chceck flights directly on airlines sites, sick! Searching flights after upgrade is a nightmare! Not recommended till you don't back to old version."
2018,1,"It's because of you they scammed me budgetair, they deduct the money and I 
didn't receive e-ticket as well as since 8 of July 2018 until now they took 
the money and they didn't provide ticket plus very very disaster costumer 
service , no answering the call and emails now I book other ticket and I 
flight already and my money with some tief companie, just advise to 
everyone if you want to lose your money book with budgetair, I was like u 
before I didn't nothing wrong except I trust on this company"
2013,1,"Plz give the  price with tax and all hidden charge. U just giving the basic fare and based on that data once v go to book ,last stage we realizing cost is high.but before that we dreamed a lot. Plz dont make us dissappoint."
2015,1,"Everytime I choose a date it will stop working. After I chose destinations, and then will click on which dates, it will stop. I am using Sony Z Ultra, Android 5.1.1 pls fix."
2016,2,"I've tried my best to get to grips with this new update. I can see what you were trying to do, but you've actually made the app more complicated to use. You should have kept things simple."
2017,1,"DISHONEST,SCAMMERS and UNRELIABLE.. my booking fees as per their e-mail is AED 2155 or $587 ;however ,they charged me AED 2225 DON'T KNOW WHY .Then I cancelled they said and confirmed through their e-mail as well that the cancellation fees will be AED260 per person in total AED520 again they charged more AED 685. Very DISHONEST and am really disappointed."
2018,1,"I bought a round ticket of 21st August go and 13th September back to South Korea, but because of a reason I couldn't go to my country and I wanted to cancel my return ticket but they aren't accepting. So I've totally loss a huge amount of money. Getting no help from anyone."
2015,5,This app is great. I've booked almost all my flights all over Europe through it. Like the look of the new update as well. Only issue is it seems to have disappeared off my apps list. I need to go in through playstore to open it.
2016,1,New updates don't give specific days that are cheaper just gives price ranges of price have to look at each individual day.  Far more time consuming now.  Such a shame as it was the best app around.
2014,1,"Moto G searching London to Lisbon flight on a fresh download of the app just get error ""you are using an outdated version of the app"" no way to progress. Waste of time and bandwidth. Uninstall"
2013,4,Love the app and helps me a lot in flight search. Would be really cool to get multiple days search like ita matrix does. This functionality is kinda weak now.  Also who decided to modify app name from Skycanner to Flights in app launcher?  It's so confusing!
2017,2,"So frustrating. It didn't work when I searched for flights. I changed my search dates and it said ""no flights found"" even though plenty of websites show available flights."
2018,1,"Use FARECOMPARE. This is awful, you do a search in tool find a flight. Then 
it just gives you a link to a website and you have to start all over..."
2018,1,Tried to log in on app after downloading. Suggested password incorrect so clicked on forgot password and repeatedly told could not send password link to email address despite it being existing profile. Lost customer
2016,2,"Downloaded this app based on google suggestion, looked at same flight itinerary on app as I did online, found my flight to be cheaper by more than $75 each way. I'll stick to Web."
2015,1,"Flights are nowhere near as cheap as first shown. Why did my search bring up a total of $277, round trip, and after choosing both flights, the minimum cost was at $651 for the cheapest flight combo. This app was a giant waste of my time."
2016,1,Did you really took the option to check prices in different dates with one click out?  The best feature of the app is not there anymore. Doesn't make any sense.
2015,2,"After time using the app, they don't work. I can't go back to change destinations or days. I uninstall and install again but the problem continue. Actually I deleted because is not working, is freeze."
2016,2,"Try using Google Flights and Skyscanner at the same time. Google finds better flights both in terms of price and travel time. I've heard friends say this app is good for last minute bookings, but that's not how I travel."
2013,5,Great app with really wonderful features and gives a very good overview of prices. Very well designed interface. Beats all web equivalents hands down
2018,1,"Different results to website, doesnt search nearly as many sites. Looked at one site, and the cheapest on the mobile app was 12th cheapest site on the web site! And it was an air nz flight and even the air nz site was cheaper!"
2013,1,"I used this app to look for ticket prices and for all the places I looked the price was any where from 4000 to 6000, and I called the airports and got prices from 800 to 1700. Who came up with this app didn't do any checking our connect to anything! In a word don't use this app!!!"
2015,1,"I downloaded this app since it looked simple in the pictures and its ratings r high. However, when i opened it up, it didnt work like what the pictures shown. I cant even go to the page that has the ""book"" button. What's wrong with this app?"
2013,5,This app is so simple to use & really does find you the best deals. It saved me $72 on a recent last-minute flight!
2016,1,"Sadly I immediately uninstalled the app, because it's not clear and also not user friendly. I used a lot the previous version, which was excellent. What a pity"
2017,1,Do not use this app!!!! I was very skeptical and wish I had listened to other bad reviews . They flew me into a different airport then I was flying out of with a separate company. I had to go to the other part of town in the middle of the night to sleep in a different airport
2016,5,I've been using Skyscanner since 2014 and found to be the most user friendly app for long haul flights. But it also works very well for Europe. The feature I like the most is the emails with reminders about price changes.
2016,5,"I love this app. The best features... Pick an airport and search trips to ""everywhere"" to find great vacation or travel spots. I also love the search ""whole month"" view. I have traveled often and this is my go-to app!!"
2017,4,Flights showing to everywhere cannot filter between international and domestic. Which makes it harder to search. The previous updates had the country first and followed by the cheapest international options. Kindly revert back this feature.
2018,5,Great App. for Traveller. This App. is far more advanced than others App. out there. You can save your search You can save your select flights You can have the lowest price sometime lowest than go to the travel agents website. üëç üëç Learn how to use it and you'll save time & money üí≤ üëç
2014,1,"None of the prices are accurate! each screen shows a different price that lures you in with what looks to be a low price, only to raise it on the next screen. 1 star due to price inaccuracy on all flights I checked."
2017,5,"An excellent app, it keep you up with latest fights prices.  It would be nice if  we can check refrences to 3rd parties selling tickets.  I don't trust these agents quickly."
2017,5,"The most helpful app i have come acrossed. I dont have to go to annoying sites and download more apps to find my flights and hotels anymore. Kayak, Expedia and Trivago can't even compare."
2014,2,"Feels like a Web browser wrapped in an app. Lacked search options so far as I can tell - no nearby airport search, no ability to search for one way flights."
2015,5,I book all my flights thanks to this amazing app. Its user friendly and provides a lot of alternatives and options for my liking. That's so far the best flight app I've ever used
2018,5,Great App when trying to get the best deal for plane tickets anywhere in the world. I think it's truly amazing. Traveled so many times already and its completely reliable.
2017,1,"It was good before. Now, They list the lowticket prices and when you actually try to complete reservation they show you the actual one. The hidden prices are probably the most expensive"
2017,2,"Love the idea of the ""explore flights to anywhere"" section, but the actual flight prices are always significantly more expensive than the ones cited. What's the point?"
2017,2,"Totally a great apps. But after update, the widget not working well. Keep showing no result. Please fix it :("
2016,5,This app has saved me so much money being able to watch for the constant change in prices for flights that I've taken recently. Love that it updates and emails you for every change even if its just a dollar difference!
2015,1,"Not sure how this has such a high rating. Chart pricing is lower than search result listing. Even then, it is 50-100% higher than airline website."
2017,2,This only finds some flights and not the best deals available. I found $180 flight on airport website and this one shows $700 for same destination with more layovers for the economy flight.
2014,1,Complains of insufficient memory with over 10GB available. Don't bother installing as the developer says it's an android issue (it's not) and won't fix it
2017,2,This app is useless if you want to price a multi-city journey as it has no option for that. I have had to resort back to using the Skyscanner website.
2016,1,After using the website was this app a disappointment. I could find on the website a lot of cheap flights. I can't find one of them with this app. There is not much more to say  .....
2013,2,"This is really cool, but my antivirus doesn't have the same opinion. This is clarified as a virus to avg and I don't think that's right."
2014,5,Clear and concise interface. Quick return of searches. Never had a problem so far. 1st point of reference when needing to know flights and prices
2016,1,"Used to by the best airfare comparison app by far. Now ""upgraded"" and really unpleasant. Having booked all fares through it for the last few years I am now resorting to look elsewhere."
2015,1,"""Indicative price"" often differs by a factor of two as compared to the price you actually get when you follow the option through. Also, pressing the back key just takes you through the different windows in a loop and you can't exit the app."
2016,1,"Regular searches using my laptop found a flight low as $550..... this app found only one flight for $2,020...... (the most expensive flight listed) where i searched...... obviously this app is not so great...."
2016,4,"Hi, From long time I am waiting skyscanner to have an option for multi destination flight search as they have on their website.But still there is no such an option in their app. Can you please add this option.thanks"
2016,3,Not very useful for India I guess I tried for cheapest ticket but they were not having data. May be good for other countries I will not say its bad. Not useful for me I'm sorry.
2014,2,"Initial search gives price and direct/changes. This doesn't seem to correspond to what you find when you drill down, with those prices seemingly absent and no sign of the direct flights mentioned. Misleading crap"
2016,1,"I cannot navigate at all. It is not easy to see multiple options. I love the desktop experience and use it all the time, but I honestly have no idea where all of these good reviews are coming from besides aesthetics."
2016,3,"This app would be 5 stars if it included multiple destination searches. Without that, it is useless for me, and I'm stuck using the web version."
2014,4,great way to track and compare prcing when planning a few trip. gave it 4 stats because i know the developers will come out with even beteet features over time.
2016,1,"While this app is much more fluid and easy on the eyes compared to others, I found the price to be consistently more expensive than others.  If you are looking for cheaper flights look elsewhere"
2018,1,"Only good for searching. I WARN AUSSIES TO NOT BOOK WITH THEM. Everything 
is in USD but they won't tell you until everything booked and you're 
overcharged :( STAY AWAY FROM THEM. I've uninstalled this app and Bravo 
App. Both toxic to my wallet."
2012,5,"Incredible app, I fly monthly and love to use the calendar to see which days are the cheapest.  It's best used to search for segments of flights rather than round trip to get the cheapest price!"
2014,5,"Used this for many flights all over the world. Can't beat them. For those reviewers who complain do some research. This is NOT an airline so don't complain about refunds etc, each airline has its own terms. Do some reading before booking. They are not amazon, and offer the best flight service and prices on the net 99.9% of the time.."
2015,1,"It was fine before. More option, cheaper findings, now it's all gone. I don't need nicer color etc, i want it to be helpful."
2015,1,"This used to be my 'go to app', but what a massive backwards step in usability! Had to switch to Kayak for the first time in years. Just give us the old apk back"
2015,4,Helps find and book the best deals. Works well. I only wish there were a way to search for multi-city flights.
2013,4,The prices displayed of the monthly graph for instance are most of the time not accurate. However : very great app !
2014,1,Couldn't find any flights direct or connecting? Nothing to get me from Nashville to Niagra Falls. It's not like I'm going to a very popular place or anything?
2014,5,"It's okay for a lot of travel stuff, no better than all the sites that already exist. But the here to anywhere option? Brilliant."
2012,5,"I've never rated an app but this one, hands down, deserves 5 stars. And it has a widget! Beautiful :')"
2016,5,Thanks guys. This app has helped me afford tickets to visit my daughter in Florida and fly her out here to Oregon many times!! Super app!
2014,4,Very accurate information. All I need to do is click only one button and I get all information. User friendly and time saving. Thank you SkyScanner
2015,1,The fact that the interface has gotten worse is problematic. But the suspect part is the new permission. The lack of seeing the new permission in use to better the app is troubling. I used to love this app.
2015,1,By the time I put my credit card information the price inflated $300 from $697 to over $1000 later find the same ticket at $700 by just going to the airline. Kayak its way better
2017,1,The previous layout was almost perfect. I liked that you could choose everywhere and get a list of cheapest to most expensive around the world for any date. Now functionality has been replaced with pictures
2017,1,"Told to download a different app or something (just directs me back to the play store page for skyscanner) every single day. Unsure why, and as a result 1/5."
2016,2,"Please go back to the old version it was way better, the new version is terrible, you cant multi-task nor does it show prices for the whole month,  the browser version is way better than this new one."
2014,4,It's help full & easy understanding UI than other mobile apps@  will add some more features like remainder and alerts like expect price when it comes (month wise)
2017,5,"Great app. Help to find cheapest airline tickets. The day i know about it, i never used any travel agent. It sounds like a you are the boss."
2018,5,"It's. Really amazing but have one suggestion add one feature for Traver get 
international cheapest flights far get notifications home country to any 
where Like Indian any airport to Cambodia any airport 3k ,. Then travelers 
can easily plan by distance"
2016,1,"If I just want to search for a fight, Its mandatory to allow this app to access device location, without the location it doesnt allows to search for a flight.I dont find any valid reason for sharing the location to this application."
2018,5,"Didn't include prices from Southwest, but that's because Southwest won't 
let third parties access that info. Five stars just because they let you 
delete your data with ease."
2016,1,The former was really handy. The chart is missin. It ws very helpful to choose a particular date when the fare is low. Disliking this new version!
2017,1,"Terrible navigation, just uninstalled it. Not user friendly but rather user ""enemydly"" (:-p)  I am a heavy user of browser version though ; )"
2015,1,New version is one of the worst update. I deleted update version. And i use chinese version because of your development team. Hated new update. I wish to use old version plz..
2018,4,"More time should be spent on developing flight searching features, like which flight is the fastest or cheapest from Bangkok to any city in Europe in March 2019. I want and advanced search option."
2017,4,Very nice application but mujhe asi application ki jarurat he jo defence parsan ki bhi flait booking kar sake me chahta hu ki ap mujhe uski jankari de ...? Thank you. ........
2016,1,"Where is the 'everywhere' option gone???? that was the best thing about this app. I can't even choose a country, it has to be a specific city. Now you are just the same as the rest of them."
2013,3,"Havent got around to using it, was just running at the background, phone crashes once a day no idea why, had to factory reset. Found out its caused by this app, phone has been fine since uninstall"
2013,4,"Best flight app i've used, finds the best price and more flights then when seaching in browser. 4STARS."
2016,1,Not worth it! The sites that you get diverted to not realiable! Such as bestjet! Give you a reasonable price and you go a head and all of the sudden increase the price!!
2015,1,It used to show a complete list of flights from all different airlines and schedules as well. Now i can only see the cheapest estimation. Do I miss it somewhere? Help please
2018,4,"Haven't used it yet, but it sure gives the cheapest flights out of all 
other apps. How legit is to be seen..."
2016,1,Used this app before on another phone no problem. Great app. Won't download on my current phone. Download pending but no joy!!
2016,4,"Brilliant interface, works smoothly without crashing. However, Id like to see multi city flight options added to this app as it is a huge miss for me."
2014,5,"I've tried 8 or so different flight apps in the last year, and this one finds the best prices. I like the interface but wish it was easier to find deals when you are flexible on dates."
2017,5,Started using this app like 4 years ago. LOVE IT LOVE IT... It takes you directly to the airline website or throuh a third party. Easy to use no hassle.
2013,3,"Cape Town Airport isn't an option which makes this app completely useless in South Africa. The app itself is great though, would love to be able to use it."
2016,3,Just as good as any other travel app.. Does its job but if you continue to shop around you will eventually find a good deal
2013,1,"No matter what dates or airports I selected it came up with ""no results"". Its a pointless app, don't waste your time trying to get it to work."
2016,1,Show high fly tickets prices only last time. I don't know what's happens with sky scanner app :(((
2016,5,I set the alerts to my email several months in advance and when the price It's good... I buy the tickets! As simple as that.
2018,5,"Among all flight ticket aggregator apps, Skyscanner is the best and 
actually shows the cheapest prices. You don't need anything else just this 
app."
2016,2,Kok aplikasi m-skyscannernya gak lengkap. Gak spt web...gak ada pilihan multicity nya..?theme dan warnanya bagus yg lama....mohon diperbaiki..thanks
2013,4,I find this application quite good. Nice database for airlines including major and some low cost player. Prices are very good
2016,5,"Planned many holidays using this app - including Canaries, Thailand, trips to London, Scotland. So easy to use and all the parameters I want included."
2016,5,"Undoubtedly,  the best of the lot. Have been using it for the least price realization. Keep up the good work."
2012,3,This is nice. The problem is when I tried to open this app the 2nd time it always prompt insufficient memory even I do have enough space. Plz fix. Tnx
2018,5,"One stop shop for flight tickets and direct car rentals ....prices at its 
best ...use this app ...u may thank me later ..if u found this helpful 
please do provide a like thank you"
2017,3,It's an okay app however it's missing the multiflight option (or at least I couldn't find it). I didn't end up using it for anything else before uninstalling and have stuck to using the website instead.
2016,3,"Out of space on my S4...yeah yeah, upgrade, I know... but until then, this Phone Only app has been uninstalled."
2018,2,The Explore function never works! It will say a flight is $719 and then when you click it the flight comes up as $1200+. It does this for every flight!
2018,1,"Tripsta or one of the travel agents used by the app should be banned. It 
rips customers off by not having a proper refund procedure for tickets 
canceled."
2017,1,"No option to choose multiple destination. Be careful when u book last minute flight, they don't update frequently"
2016,4,"I really like the refreshed app, I have starting using it much more. The only problem I found is with using filters - they do not refresh the results sometimes."
2012,5,I cannot compliment this app enough. Very good search function with great ability to filter results. Great time and money saver. Well done SS!
2016,3,"When trying multiple different airports, one way vs R/T with differing dates it requires a lot of back and forth across the pages / menus. Fares are worth it though I suppose!"
2013,3,App is awesome for sure though for Pakistan its not getting the best rates like if I am purchasing a ticket a month before departure date then in Pakistan I will get it 20 or 30% cheaper though the app always show the standard rate. Need to work on this.
2015,5,Best app for finding flights. Leave your destination open and select your closest airport for departure and Skyscanner will find the cheapest flights out there to random spots! Flew to Colombia from Ft Lauderdale for 80 bucks flew to Jamaica from ft Lauderdale for 55. Didn't plan either trip
2016,4,App is big on convenience and efficiency. There are times where I find a different/better price going directly to the carrier's site.
2016,2,"This app lingers in the background constantly, I hate apps that use resources unnecessarily. When I want to use the app I install it, then I uninstall it directly afterwards. Repeat as needed."
2014,5,"It has ALL the features I could need - saves recent searches, displays a graphic of prices based on different days, has a widget that auto-updates, etc. Love it!"
2012,5,"Fantastic app, used for about 1.5 years, love it. Useful in comparing airlines with there best price. Best of its easy to use, can pick what is the best time is to fly from the ticketing chart provided and most of all its FREE!!!!"
2022,5,"Very helpful app. Finds flights fast, compares and shows lowest rates. Thank you!"
2017,5,App works well with my Xiaomi mimax. Interface is good. Results are meaningful.  Recommend
2015,5,"Love this app, dead easy to use, shows exactly what I'm looking for and runs fast! Oh and helps me save on flights. Great stuff guys."
2017,3,I'm confused... I would like this app a lot better if I could actually purchase tickets... I'm looking at pictures on here and mine doesn't have a GO TO SITE button??
2016,1,Pls change it back to the old version just like the website... You guys have just destroyed the app completely
2012,5,"Sky scanner software turn dark on Asus tf700t, but work perfect on apple I pad. Sick of Asus android software."
2015,1,The old layout eas so much better!!! Wouldn't have updated it I knew the update has entirely changed the layout to a worse one!!! Very disappointed!!
2012,4,"Easy interface, thorough and smart searches. Have bout actually tried purchasing through it though"
2016,2,"Uninstalled it straight away. Can't choose nearby airports or times of departures in more options, which is the whole basis of the flexibility of skyscanner and very useful."
2013,4,"I like this app.  It was easy to navigate, many local airports were available and it can filtered to search flights by your preference.  Good job with this app."
2017,2,Nowhere near as easy to use as the website. Kept wanting to use my location despite selecting 'dont ask again'
2013,1,Pricing is different once you go to book. Might as well have gone to the company site in the begining. Waste of time go between that gives inaccurate pricing.
2013,5,"Been using SS for years now, the app works great. Thanks for all the great cheap trips!"
2016,2,Mobile website is better. Lacks the option to do a multi city trip and filtering more than one airline is broken.
2016,4,Better prices than Hopper. I LOVE the new minimum prices estimates for all the months coming up - perfect for deciding when's best to go on holiday!
2017,5,I used this app literally to book my first flight...pretty good I have to say still using it my friends are suprised given the prices I get out of this app
2015,2,Please provide fare alert for preferred airlines also. This will be very useful since no one have provided such alert option.
2017,4,Good for getting a base idea for planning a trip.  Though these are budget deals so extras a rarely included like check baggage
2015,1,I tried downloading this 3 times it keep telling downloading for a looong tin.the app never downloaded or I stall. Before you blame the environment let me tell you that my internet connection is perfect an just now I updated all installed apps
2011,5,Itz amazing. Works superb very useful... RATES SHOULD BE IN INR instead of ¬£..
2017,4,Makes me want to travel everywhere all the time. I lovely application needs some refinement but overall a home run.
2013,1,"I do not know why people say here that it is ""easy to use"" ""great app""... I neither can make it search nor sort the results properly."
2018,5,Best feature I liked most is monthly comparison of flights Second most attractive features you can search for flights to anywhere and them select as of your choice Third feature is search by country you don't have to be airport specific
2018,5,"Wonderful and VERY APPRECIATED! Very important to save as much as I can. 
Thank you JOBCASE for referring me!"
2016,3,"It works well, but I've found cheaper flights and hotels using other travel apps."
2014,1,When looking for a flight prices are different at each step. Drastically different. So it's pointless to search for a flight when you are not sure how much you'd be paying.
2015,4,I use this to determine which airports have the cheapest flights in or out and around what dates my flights will be cheapest....very useful. I can't ever seem to find that lowest price that they say is available though...That's why 4/5.
2015,3,The fares quoted are misleading as there is often at least 25% increase from booking agent. I use this app to find out which airlines have specials then book from the airline direct.
2017,4,"Easy to use, sometimes flights that show up aren't actually available. Otherwise, great app!"
2011,4,The only negative thing I can say is when I open app it shows weird searches I've never done. If it stayed where I'd left it I would rate a 5
2016,1,I don't like the new version at all. The old one is simple and cleaner. I just unstall it.
2012,5,My family & I travel internationally at least 3 times a month. This app has made such a big difference for us as I get to choose the best rates and most convenient schedules in a matter of minutes!
2018,3,"I love skyscanner, but this app doesn't allow me to chose EUROS and it is asking permanently for my location... So annoying!!!!!"
2015,2,"I book here earlier, im wondering it says my booking payment is cant be completed. But i checked my card 6 thousand was already deducted"
2016,5,Search everywhere feature is so nice for those who just want to travel with only price in mind and don't care where the trip takes them
2014,1,"You have to set up a from location to use this, however, it found zero results for ATL, CHI, BWI, Atlanta, or Baltimore. Useless!  Uninstalled."
2017,3,"Make my trip is giving cheap flights, but details of such not included inskyscanner, you have lost your trust."
2016,1,"If you read the positive reviews , I wonder who would ever write : loving it all day long. Sounds like many fake positive reviews"
2018,4,"I think its a helpful and Genuine App to check flights and when is the Best 
Time of the year to book flights for one's dream Trip."
2017,1,"App sucks, it says one price when you look at the map and something completely different when you try to pursue buying the tickets"
2012,5,Easy to use.  Great application.  Compatible galaxy tab p1000. Download and appreciate :)
2016,5,"Very useful and handy. Although it was better before the latest release, when it was lighter and with the flight research tool only."
2018,1,"Latest update broke the app, and it no longer starts even after Force Stop, 
Clear Cache and restarting phone."
2016,4,I've used Skyscanner-All Flights to find the cheapest flights from Birmingham Airport to JFK NY and found the cheapest one which was awesome. but still this app is great for finding the best and cheapest flights.
2011,5,Fast and pretty accurate on the go! Finds great rates! Samsung galaxy s2
2016,5,I love it. It's awesome. Used it on my exchange program for traveling everywhere. The search everywhere feature is my favourite
2023,1,"–° –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–º –≥–æ–¥–æ–º –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫ —Å–æ–∂–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—Å—è –≤—Å—ë –º–µ–Ω–µ–µ –∏ –º–µ–Ω–µ–µ —É–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã–º –∏ –ø–æ—è–≤–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –±–∞–≥–∏. –ñ–∞–ª—å, –ø–æ–º–Ω—é –ª–µ—Ç 6-7 –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥ –æ–Ω–æ –±—ã–ª–æ –º–æ–∏–º –ª—é–±–∏–º—ã–º."
2013,4,Can you make a like an sky scaner with this it uses gps you need internet and it will show you all the flights that are going past you on map
2015,1,"This is to inform all that skyscanner having tie up with travel trolley part of southalltravel is one of the worst Travel company, they refused to honor same fare asked for copy of card with others personal doc's beware of there trap"
2012,5,Definitely one of the best Android apps around. Easy and hassle-free.
2016,1,I used to love it. it was my app of choice. I keep getting errors unreliable information. requirements to refresh.
2017,5,"This app is excellent, after checking here no need to refer or cross check anywhere. Fantastic info"
2011,1,"2) and for my city, doesn't even show delta or southwest, which is worthless to me bcz swa is half the price of the airlines displayed in this app."
2017,5,Great app!  Love being able to see flight prices for all locations for a specific time frame.
2014,4,Only issues is the weird pricing when it comes to budget flights. And I personally do not trust the travel sites that they recommend when booking for two legged flights of different airlines when doing a inevitable stop over.
2018,4,"App is ok but I think it could do with owning it's own Airline to give the 
discerning traveller like myself good prices all the time..üòâ"
2015,1,"The app never displays cheaper airliners you can't get a round trip ticket beneath 800‚Ç¨,they need to include low cost airliners"
2013,4,How can I get the prices in INR indian rupees? If this problem can be fixed then its more usable and deserves a 5 star.
2016,5,I'd give 6 stars if I could. The red/yellow price high/low feature is amazing!
2017,3,"I don't care about hotels, this app should only be for what it is originally meant to be: flights, no more."
2017,5,"It's a great app which compares prices and finds the best deals for you, saving ALOT of searching on the web."
2016,5,I used the website for the first time yesterday and I was very impressed with the beautiful work.  Thanks for your efforts and keep on...
2012,5,"Thank you for making my life easier :) and free.  Can I request multiple transit, cities checking??"
2016,5,"Love this app, have been using it for years! Finds me the best prices on flights."
2013,4,"Very good n it's fast, only thing missing is different currencies, it only has $ option, if you can add few more than a definite 5 star :) am from India!"
2017,5,Great app ever! Save my time to compare flights prices and flight information are pretty accurate too.
2012,4,Don't know what happened this app just keeps crashing I have an S2 with RR jelly bean was working fine until yesterday... HELP
2016,2,"The new update took away the settings to ""silence"" the app?!?! Are you guys so desperate to get buyers?"
2013,5,Thank you... Perfact app.for.me.sence.o travel alot this time of  year..Im jist able to plan and go.
2018,1,"User unfriendly bad app. Compared to the website clearly not recommend a 
ble. Deinstalled. Keep using website."
2014,4,You guys are doing awesome! Please integrate all your apps into one. Makes more sense. Hence 4*. Cheers!
2014,4,"New to this app though i haven't tried it yet up until now I think I'm going to enjoy it once I do start searching and booking flights just based on becoming familiar with it,"
2016,1,Impossible de marquer une autre ville de d√©part que Londres... √áa m'arrangerait peut-√™tre si je n'habitant pas Paris...
2018,5,Best app ever. Got the cheapest flight ever to disney world. Thank you.
2014,1,"Doesn't work. Uninstalled it. Always keep getting the error ""temporarily out of service"" or something like that"
2013,1,Not happy as the app / site gives different prices if you book return flights as opposed to booking two direct flights separately..this cost me $150
2018,4,"The app is good, they provide the cheapest flight but I think there's a bug on the app, I replace the currency twice to PHP but still euro is appearing on my screen, all in all it's good but sad I had to compare the currency form time to time"
2016,2,"Before the update it was simple, useful and easy now its confusing,  it was easy to search for certain destination with no specific date to see the cheapest time to go to this destination now I can't do that üòî"
2013,5,"Fantastic, works perfect! By the way flights are so much cheaper at gatwick rather than heathrow"
2016,5,Sky scanner has always been amazing feature with conjunction with mobile app it revolutionize the way I travel.thanks sky scanner team &lt;3
2014,5,I luv your site and the ability to get price alerts. It's even easier to find spesific flights than on the airlines own site. Well done
2016,3,Can you guys please add a function when we could find cheaper flight few days around the expected departure date? Thanks!
2016,1,I want old version..No option to search for countries.only shows cities.. :(( I can not find where to fly cheapest city in country..any solution to use old version???
2013,5,I book a lot of airfares and this great app saves me having to visit multiple websites to get the best price. Price results are comparable to the online equivalents.
2014,2,I got this app to see the cheapest way to get home but it only does round trip it would not let me choose one way I couldnt even find out where to change it VERY FRUSTRATING
2016,5,It helps to have an app like this on my phone. It offers great prices on flights and allows you to track price changes.
2014,4,"It is so quick and gives such reasonable prices that you can't help think, ' why the bell am I here?'"
2017,4,Time saver. Fast results. Compare flights and times
2016,5,Great app. Keeps me updated with price changes too. Easy to use.
2016,5,Helped me many times to get the best routes and best fares world wide. Used it to buy hundred of flight tickets.
2013,5,It works perfectly great on my samsung galaxy y. I love this app!
2017,5,Really useful and helpfull.. keep updated.  Thank you
2015,1,Will be removing this app. The update as in previous conments has ruined what had been a reliable source for flights.
2013,1,You can change the destination of your flight plus I found cheaper on various other web sites than the results it gave me.
2014,1,Indicated price is nowhere near what the real flight price is half the time. Quicker to check various websites yourself. Pointless.
2018,5,Great app!! Cuts out a lot of hassle for searching for best price flights and hotels üëç
2016,2,Berbeza tawaran dengan laman sebenar sykt penebangan Contoh air Asia ada promosi rm140 ke Jakarta. Tapi dalam skyscanner masih berharga rm300+ paling murah.
2016,1,This used to be a nice flight tracker. Now it just tries to be a lousy booking system. Uninstall !!!
2016,5,I absolutely LOVE this App!!! I recommend it to EVERYONE... I wouldn't be caught anywhere without it... I love it so much I've also downloaded the Skyscanner car rental app which also happens to be AMAZING...  DEFINITELY a #1 MUST HAVE APP in the 20th century... AWESOME JOB TO THE INVENTORS!!!!!
2013,3,Cool little app
2018,2,"is the multicity tab not appearing in my android version. am using it on 
samsung s6 galaxy edge"
2012,2,I can't check a flight more than 2 weeks in advance.
2012,1,"Continually tells me there are no flights from Sydney  to L.A. at any time, uninstalling now, only reason it received 1 star is because it wouldn't accept none"
2018,5,"I use skyscanner app very frequently, it gives accurate results and lower 
prices too. I recommend skyscanner."
2016,4,Haven't had any major issues. Has a few bugs but works OK.
2015,1,Cannot choose other country. Type from Singapore and keeps showing  United Kingdom.. No way to select other country
2018,4,"So far so good but yet to book. Still finding cheaper flights via other 
sites."
2017,4,"The best part of the app is ""from anywhere to anywhere"" planning a trip and you dont know where to go. Skyscanner to the rescue"
2011,5,Scans all possible flights on every airline. Works! --Galaxy Tab
2015,1,"The app was great until this newest update. Interface, layout, and font size is big downgrade"
2012,5,Best easy and the only complete flight information tool on android platform. 5 STARS
2015,2,Spessissimo voli che vengono trovati a una cifra quando li si va a prenotare costano pi√π del doppio. Io lo uso per verificare orari e compagnie disponibili poi uso jetcost che ha offerte economiche molto migliori
2017,2,No option for multiple city search. It would have been great of there is. Now I need to download Kayak
2013,5,Best app I've used seriously. So simple and great for finding a cheap weekend away if your open to going anywhere!
2016,5,Line give 20 free coins. So i download it. Thanks
2018,5,"So far,Thank you for making me happy, will continue supporting this app. üòç"
2014,2,Could not find flights that showed up on other sites. Could not do multi city. Uninstalled the app.
2016,5,Very good app for booking flight with best comparing rates from all online booking portal. Just fantastic
2017,5,Magnificent app. Very fast and stores favourite flights and history also very well in a calender format.
2013,5,"I use this App because its the best one to use for of world wide. As I am English and work in Venezuela, and live in the Philippines its the only one I can use that give me all I need."
2015,3,Kindly add multi city option...plus my watched flights clear after 24 hours or so....rest is 4.5 star
2017,1,"Uninstalled. Too many notifications. If I want to book a hotel I book one. I don't need ""reminders""."
2015,2,Price listed is 10-15 more than cheapest option available. Google flights lists it better.
2016,4,Great app. But can never find it as its called flights instead of skyscanner
2012,4,"Very useful tools but sometimes I've found some very good prices and when i click for details, the prices are not as shown previously."
2012,5,Really neat works well and easy to use. The widget is just awesome.
2012,2,No option of multi city. Kayak has it and is more reliable
2014,4,The app should have multi city search option. Otherwise all is perfect.
2016,1,"This app is useless now, skyscanner must be in some hot water with the big airline companies because they've become irrelevant with this update."
2012,5,It is so quick and easy :) prices are the cheapest specially on tuesdays ... I've bought my tickets through here already n will again
2015,1,Very bad didn't work would not find any flights for where I was going date or time.... did not like un-install waahoooo
2013,1,This app is bs. Those are definitely not the cheapest flights. Waste of time and memory.
2014,1,"When booking, the apps gets stuck when filling out the dob and I can't proceed further. Fix it lest I uninstall it."
2016,5,The app is so good and is right on point! The cheapest  flights! ever
2018,4,"Been using Skyscanner for about four years. Almost always find the best 
deals on here."
2012,4,Wish it can have like arrival status where I can track planes. So I can know wen friend or family are arriving.
2014,2,I was trying to book a flight all week finally found a good price an i click on it then it goes up Im upset i need to book soon then i try it again an its saying theres a problem FIX THIS ASAP!then 4 stsrs
2013,4,Will give it a 5 stars if allow to change the currency for ppl all around the world ^^ so that we won't need to change the currency from pounds to our currency ourselves.
2016,3,I think there must a flight live status option. It's useful too
2013,5,Than s a useful app for figuring out where you can fly domestically or internationally on a budget. It makes it easy to see what locales are currently on sale.
2013,4,Unfortunately it doesn't look like there's a way to search for multi destination flights.
2012,2,Only gives me options for 2013??? Please fix as I know this app is amazing
2011,4,Is a practic tool for look your flights. Works very good.
2017,5,Convenient & dependable. Planned almost my entire 1-month Europe trip using this.
2013,5,"There simply is no better way of checking flight prices across multiple airlines than with Skyscanner. The ability to filter airlines, airports, departure times and stops just takes the hassle out of planning the boring parts of a trip so you can concentrate on the good stuff."
2018,3,"Why the ios version have the flight details and in Android dos not, that 
really matter."
2016,1,Was my goto flight booking application but the new UI a spoiler. Feedback to no avail.
2017,3,Old version is fast. This one is take long time to give the prices.
2013,5,Well done you have done your research and produced an app which does everything really well. Should be six stars
2015,1,The new update is a waste if time. Have uninstalled it as it is nowhere as good as old version
2017,5,"All works no problem. Developers, Keep a good work!"
2017,1,"Get it wrong, first time by an hour. You don't track the flight, you guess."
2015,4,This apps is very useful to everyone of us who loves to travel. Thanks for the creator of this app.
2013,5,Really good app and service. Easy to use and has cool design. I would happily pay for it.
2016,5,Great app.. Easy to use and I get alerts anytime the prices change!
2013,4,Works well and quickly. Filtering could be improved.
2014,1,"Installed on nexus 5 running KitKat and does not allow searching of any airports, if I could give it zero stars I would as it it unusable....."
2013,5,Im really impressed. So simple to use. Not booked anything using this this yet. But so fqr so good
2017,4,Comparing prices .. many airlines.. different websites .. excellent ticket booking
2011,4,Best app I've ever use. Fast and very easy to use. We love it.
2017,5,Have used over and over again. Love this app. I keep recommending it out to friends. Keep up the good work!
2016,1,It says i dont have internet. Hiw come i was able to download it. Duuh.
2015,5,"Itz great app n low prices compared to other, however it would b great if can add some details about flight lyke luggage, food etc. Over all itz great app"
2012,4,"Great app, Is give it 5 stars if it allowed you to search more than one airport at once."
2012,5,"best app i found for flight bookings/info also shows local flights (for india), changing currencies, comparing daily rates so much more amazing app !"
2013,5,Very clear and accurate. Easy to use to find all kind of flights. Thumbs up!
2012,4,Nice to not have to search.
2016,5,It's very easy to use and great prices. Definitely recommending it to family and friends.
2017,5,"Wish it could search ""whole month"" instead having to select specific flight dates but other than that it's a very well designed and helpful app."
2016,5,I use it for flight pricing comparisons. It's easy to use and indeed found the lowest priced ticket
2017,5,Amazing how powerful this little app is. The UI and ux leave nothing to complain too
2016,1,Since update app is so hard to use now. I cant compare prices anymore.
2018,1,Could not use this app as It was showing currency in pound and the feature to change the currency was not working. Had to uninstall thw app.
2015,1,This latest update keeps crashing please fix it. I use this app all the time this latest uodate is very very disappointing
2015,1,Price on calendar is one thing...click and next window is another! False advertising!
2013,5,"Great application. One of the best designed apps for your mobile. Well thought out, great ergonomics"
2018,1,"The prices never match up and change on every webpage redirection. Use 
Google flights."
2017,4,The best app to help u choose the best flight to suit your travel needs.
2016,1,Ohh what's wrong with the latest updates and it's so useless for searching for a cheapest ticket and just only have a color sign for cheap or expensive tickets
2013,2,I found cheaper flights by just running a google search.. This site averaged 400$ more..
2017,5,It's just spectacular...it has everything you will ever need to book your flight with paradise and it does it very quickly.I strongly suggest everyone to download it as quick as possible to save money on buying tickets next time.‚úå
2017,5,I won't ever use another place for flights! Easy and by far the best deals!!
2015,5,Excellent App... The best App I have!! Love to book through here because this App is honest..easy to handle and in seconds..flights around the Globe! I Love it! *****
2013,5,that's the wonderful app for us. must be install our phones...
2013,5,Git recommended by a friend of mine. And awesome. I can find the best flight for.
2023,1,Ye log thug chor jase hotels ko bhi support krte h 21000 luta h mera rukmani Inn Hotel valo ne vrindavan chor fraud scamers
2015,2,The app actually shows different prices compared with the website. Also it doesn't show all the possible routes or connection.

2017,1,U cannot see all the ticket prices on ones just u have to check one day after another
2016,1,Too many settings to change and apply to get this work. Can find much better apps to work same no complex settings

2014,4,Love the app but missing a feature for multi-city trips
2012,5,I like how you can filter by time of day. I found my flight instantly.
2012,5,This is simply the best way to look at how your airfare is affected by your choice of travel dates.
2013,1,not useful if you are only getting a one way ticket.
2012,5,"Accurate to it's given data, useful to track fares and flight times! ten stars for me!"
