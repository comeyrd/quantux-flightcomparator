year,rating,review
2023,5,"It's really mind-blowing how low of the prices the flights are for this app. What's even more amazing is the best deals seem to all come from this app. I've tried other flight websites and I stumbled upon you all, when I say absolute best prices that's exactly what I mean, especially if you are planning a trip in advance. Try it you won't ever be disappointed"
2023,4,"I really like the kayak app.. it's great for finding prices for many different booking sites. The problem is the search error issue still hasn't been fixed after all these years. Sometimes when I search flights it will only pull about 10 to 20% of the results. Instead of kayak saying ""search error"" it just displays the results with the majority of the flights missing. There's no easy way to get it to search again either, once it thinks it has all the results it just keeps showing the same."
2023,2,"The app no longer works for hotel searches. For the past 6 months everytime i search for a hotel, it floods my list with hotels that arent available for the selected dates. I never find one hotel available until i scroll past 100 unavailable listings. On top of this huge error/glitch, there is no way to quickly contact customer service, it is impossible to contact Kayak through their app, i spent an hour trying to find a ""contact"" button or phone number or email. Big waste of time over and over."
2022,3,"I find Kayak to have the most customizable flight alerts. It's still the only service I know of to offer flexible dates on searches. However, functionality is not great. For ex when i get push notifications for a low price, it doesn't bring me to the alert. I have to manually navigate to the saved search and sometimes i can't even find the low price i was alerted to. Plus there doesn't seem to be a way to opt out of email alerts."
2021,2,"In the past the app has been pretty accurate with prices. But there's a huge bug in the saved trips right now, where most of the prices in those lists are not refreshing. I have to click on the flight (if it even lets me, doesn't always) to go see what the actual price is, but even then I see the old price when I return to the saved trip. This started after this last update."
2019,5,"Does as well as any other app and better than any I've tried, including the over-advertised Trivago. Love the ability to track any flight (even see where it is enroute) and the ability to view all departures and arrivals for ALL flights at any airport. I also like the fly to anywhere feature that will show current best rates all over the country, displayed on a map. It also keeps track of all past trips and total miles travelled. I can't think of any negatives."
2021,5,"This app exceeds my expectations. I'm a first time traveler and Kayak has helped me stay organized, keep me up to date and everything in one place. Alot less stress on my part. Instead of trying to remember what app I used for what reservation and having to search through troves of emails I can just go to kayak and with a few clicks I have every important piece of information. Absolutely love it and recommend it. Especially for first time travelers who have no experience in this area."
2019,2,"It used to be really good, but recently it's just awful. They often direct you to book at shady sites, half the time the price they show isn't actually available when you try to book (just repeatedly keeps saying ""Booking failed"" and suggesting trying again, without ever actually updating the prices), it's incredibly slow, and arguably worst of all, doesn't show the best deals, even when Skyscanner or the airlines' own sites do."
2019,5,"i really like that you can have an open ended destination. i like to take short jaunts here and there, so it helps me pick where to go. I do wish there was a way to set up email alerts with more specific criteria. instead of staying within a certain radius, i would like to stay outside a radius - in my case, i don't want anything within 1K miles. but it is an easy app to use and the notifications are actually helpful and not overbearing in frequency."
2021,1,"This app is just rip-off garbage! First, it doesn't show you the final price of a hotel, so what you end up paying could easily be twice what's shown. Then the hotels this app shows aren't always there. Often, when you click on a hotel to see the ""deal"", the actual cost shown by the hotel is much more. The app doesn't let you filter, and the sort order is simply ""trust us"". This means they shows hotels that have paid a fee higher in the order. I've used the Kayak website before, which is why I downloaded and used the app on a recent trip to Florida (what a mistake!). The website is helpful and useful, and I'll probably continue to use it, but I uninstalled the app while on my trip. My advice - unless you have money falling out of your pockets, don't use this app."
2019,5,"Great app, best feature is that it shows total hotel cost including tax and fees that are typically hidden and hard to find. I wish it had the price chart feature and general dest like ""Europe"" similar to Google flights. What most travel companies dont understand, is that people typically had a target budget but not a specific destination. Imagine an app being able to search: Two week trip, must leave Fri, must be back on Sun, Non-stop flights, Europe, anytime in the next 6 months."
2019,1,"After the break and fix, it's back to unusable. UPDATE : Kayak must have put a fix in. Works great now, as always. I especially like the explorer function. Normally a great app, but the new update makes the app hang. When it eventually starts, I can't log in with email. The login with email button spins. Once Il actually put in my user name and password, but ""submit"" button was grayed out. Literally unusable."
2020,5,"Great little app that's always responsive when you need it. I always check for prices here before I purchase a trip, book a hotel or car rental. I have not used the trip activities section but I understand it is very extensive as well. I also love how easy it is to track all my trip related information no matter where I buy it from. Highly recommended."
2020,5,"Love the ""Trips"" option to email all the ticket confirmations to Kayak and have the app to organize and save them into an itenerary. So nice to have everything in one spot and have reminders of when to check-in. Kayak even told me about a delay and gate change before the airline contacted me. Great job Kayak! I have recommended the app to my friends/family who have multiple flights and events to keep up with. My favorite travel app! Please keep it free and have a transparent privacy policy."
2019,1,"Scam. Getting significantly higher prices for identical flights at the same time as my friend right next to me. Tested this several times: two phones, same search query, different results. I happen to fly a lot and spend more on airlines; and my prices come out over $200 higher than my friend's for the same international flights. Scammed me out of hundreds of dollars this way. Use Google flights through an anonymous browser window instead."
2023,1,"Fake prices, add taxes and $10 to every advertised price. Kayak advertises hotel rates at $58 but only for Agoda. Any other booking agent site add $40 so sorting from low to high does not work. When you click on it none of the rates are $58 it's 68 then add $10 for tax and hotel fees. What you usually get is a $78 hotel infested with bed bugs and claims of breakfast, a gym and pool when that is not the case. Agoda advertising rates on kayak are a joke good luck getting those."
2019,4,Great overall experience. But I can't stand that it tracks when you're looking for a certain flight and then keeps raising the price. It's very unprofessional to present a certain price and then change it to a higher one when you click it. If that continues I will book my flights elsewhere
2019,2,"The application has declined. The dates on the flight options show only 3 digits, not 4. So, November 21 shows as 11/2 not 11/22. You have to click on the option to know what date is indicated. Also, on the calendar, for various dates, such as +/- 3 days, the calendar shows brackets for only - 3 days. Finally, the application often fails to complete a search. It just ""times out."""
2023,1,"Went out of my way to actually give you a star. App been preforming really bad lately, slow and sluggish In the search bar it won't show you the country/airport you typed unless it's been searched before while the app was actually working, so basically you can't search new places or nothing if you cleared the app. Will change when fixed, but right now unusable Thanks"
2023,2,"This review is for using the trip planner in the app. It is a nice idea but hard work to use, certainly from my mobile. I kept ending up with multiple trips and had to edit everything from my PC. What would have taken 15 minutes on a spread sheet took over an hour on the app. Another problem was that individual events were in the wrong order. This particularly applied to hotel bookings that used the check-in / check-out times."
2023,1,"Great until last update, I was in one of my trips when I got a prompt to update the app. That trip no longer comes up or displays. On other android phones that I didn't update the app march 2024 trip is there, no issues"
2023,1,"I use other apps now. There's no way to reduce alerts to 1-2 a week. So, my inbox gets bombarded with a daily mail. The design was so much better a few years ago when it came to setting alerts. Now, I cannot even find a way to select the same airport to return to. I don't want to return to a different airport if my car is going to be parked at another!"
2023,4,The app is good for a person like me who wants to always travel but on a budget.. best way to find out the cheapest option on a particular time interval. The only drawback i felt was that there is no option for a train journey. Initially the navigation was hard but eventually when u get the hold of it things are understandable.
2023,1,This app is a classic example of BAIT AND SWITCH advertising. The price they bid is not the price you pay. And it's not just the baggage and other options you have during the booking process. There are many better options. Be careful of Kyak
2023,3,"This is a great app, but I can only give it three-stars due to its constant resetting of your baggage to zero for each and every search. These kinds of bait and switch tactics are the worst way to treat your customers. Just tell that Sales VP, no. Like everyone else, they should have to actually work for their keep."
2023,2,This app is intentionally displaying wrong informations and the search results are therefore useles for me: if i am asking for flights with one or no stop at all why is it showing me as top results flights with 2 or 3 stops even for short flights?
2023,5,"Great app to build trip itinerary so you know where to be when. The 'show driver' feature when traveling internationally is very handy. Also great to share trip with people so they can track you or know where to be of it is a group trip. Searching feature is also great, especially being able to limit by loyalty program or just look at cheapest, fastest, etc. Highly recommended!"
2023,2,"can't cancel my reservation, super painful UI. called the rental place and they have no idea, made my life worse not better"
2023,1,"I booked and paid a rental car 5 months in advance, just to arrive in a foreign country on the day of my booking and learn from Europcar that the booking wasn't valid. I had to make a new booking and pay again directly with Europcar so Kayak stole $1000 from me. I've been in contact with them for the past few weeks to get a refund but so far they've just tried to make excuses or shift blame to other parties. These people are scammers and no one should ever use their service!"
2023,3,The flex dates feature is one of the unique attributes kayak offers but the calendar grid selection is frustrating and unintuitive when modifying specific dates. Flight information also isn't always up to date and flights in a trip will appear without a price or the ability to click on them suddenly
2023,4,"Good basic information. It would be nice to know what upgrades are available ( extra leg room, etc.) And cost for each airline, especially for Economy section. Lufthansa posts some of that but prices are not always clear. ""BASIC"" , ""Multiple Fares "" labels are too vague."
2023,1,"Don't trust this booking engine, they advertise on their website scamers travel agencies. Yes, I confirm that I have a potential fraud case with a Gotogate travel agency, which I was directed to book flight tickets by kayak engine!"
2023,4,App itself is OK but you need to get rid of spam listings from people like 'TravelUp' who lie about the price to get you to click their link
2023,2,Terrible search. It keeps reseting my search criteria every time. I couldn't figure out how to use it or how to look for hotel and flight. Wasted half an hour battling with it and went back to using the Web version. Maybe it my brain that works in the wrong way.
2023,5,"Best way of finding suitable flights when on a flexible schedule! I've been using Kayak for years and there's really nothing better out there. There's so many options to fine-tune the search, not to mention the option to getting a matrix of 7 by 7 days to see which day has the fastest / cheapest / most suitable flights. Highly recommended!"
2023,5,"Amazing customer service! I had an issue with the search engine. Decided to write them about it. And they answer pretty quick, and provided a new update to fix the issue. Now its even better. And more options with more than 330 days in advance for air travel. Other sites wont show a thing. It was my second favorite site. Now is my first."
2023,5,"Always the cheapest flights. And the easiest to review. I recommend only booking flights direct with the airline. The third party providers are less able to help you if your flight gets cancelled, for example."
2023,5,"Amazing app for organizing multiple flights from different airlines, events, and stays all into one easily accessible place. Great if you're the type of person that's very detail oriented!"
2023,1,Terrible experience - downloaded the app and I can see great deals but I can't access them. I click and end up with a blank page! This has been happening for weeks. Developers help
2023,5,Used it all the time when I traveled alot when kayak first came out in early 2000s !!! It was perfect and top of the service industries agencies I can't believe they've slacked off in any way here in the 2023s I trust kayak now s I did way back then I've got 2 trips coming up to Palm Springs and another to S an Diego I will be using kayak both trips not the other services 😀 😄 😉 kayak has my heart for life
2023,5,Kayak is the most practical way of buying your airfare (to any place in the world) without any hassle and doubt.
2023,5,Kayak has been my go-to app for a handy comparison of flights and cars for a few years now. You can purchase right through the app. Fast accurate and easy to use.
2023,1,"Used to work, got to a point that it started searching forever without returning any results. I uninstalled, reinstall... nothingng. It's been a couple of months . I reinstalled it again today, and it's the same problem."
2023,5,I've been using Kayak for years. It's the best app! Love how easy it is to compare flights. Lots of great filters to get exactly the type of flight you want.
2023,5,Great app for collecting all itinerary details together. One place to look when you forget where you are going or when you planned to be there!
2023,2,Two stars because not All websites or companies are trusted or professional. I asked kayak to provide me email to one of those company and never replied to me.
2023,5,It shows me options other sites don't and I have never had a problem.
2023,2,Quite annoying. Even when you filter for checked bags they give you a price but the actual price doesn't include checked bags. Totally not transparent.
2023,1,App is unusable. PLEASE FIX! I've used this app for many years but latest update hangs and crashes every time I try to open it. I have to use the web/desktop site now.
2023,4,it's a nice app for people with low money and want to go on a trip but the app makes your choice disappear
2023,5,"There's not a lot more you could want from a travel app. Searching for hotels and flights is easy, good filter settings to narrow down what your looking for, useful in the map view, heatmaps for attractions, shopping,night life etc. overlooked feature is the kayak trip manager, just as good if not better than some of the alternatives. You can even import accommodation, flights,buses, trains, galleries, even if booked through external providers, or obsucure tickets. I'm impressed, and it's free!"
2019,2,"Really liked the look of it-modern and great updates and love the email storage feature, but its hard to quickly distinguish what type of travel each line is. Would love to have clear icons specifying whether we have a flight, train, car or accommodation. for those long trips it would be handy to quickly view. until then I'll use the competition's."
2023,5,Kayak offers the best possible flight prices!
2023,2,The same locations are available elsewhere significantly cheaper almost 100% of the time in my experience
2019,3,"It's my favorite booking app; not perfect but usually fits good my needs. Unfortunately recently the filter for ""Direct"" flights got broken; it filters out everything even when one can see choices available without stopovers in the unfiltered view. It makes finding flights more painful and wastes time. Please fix it for getting an additional star."
2023,1,"I never wanted to install your app. PEROID. Now the app. Multiplied and I now have 5 icons. Will not allow it to uninstall, remove even from settings. Your whole app. Should be nucked form orbit! What a waste of time!"
2023,5,"a fast, easy. thorough review of most available flights...to anywhere. Used for years with good results."
2023,2,"you put in one class & every single time, it gives me economy. If I wanted to fly economy, I would have put that into my criteria."
2023,5,"Been using it for many years, has all the features needed to book for travel"
2021,4,"Thanks for the great app! In the search results list I still see the price per person instead of the total price per group (according to the number of travellers entered), which is somewhat misleading. Could you please replace the amount shown with the total or just add below another line stating 'total' (as they do in Skyscanner)?"
2023,5,Easy navigation and great options.
2023,5,Great tool when travelling and very accurate
2023,5,This application is the most efficient and cost-effective way to book flights and hotels.
2023,5,This app is great at finding the best flights. it does the search for you.
2023,3,"well it is Really Good!!! but you guys need a Better Scam Filtering... also a way to Rate your own ""Partner"" booking sites"
2023,5,By far the best app to organize and track your trips.
2023,1,"Don't download this apps,, the price difference and double,, if someone doesn't know,, you will be good fish,, so try it with different app ,"
2023,1,"kindly ensure that when someone cancels, refund is done immediately"
2023,2,"Worked well until the most recent update. Now the app crashes whenever I try to view an upcoming trip, which is why I use the app in the first place."
2023,3,I don't use this app enough. I only have a phone and when I try to book multiple flights I find it difficult to get them in the proper order or I don't seem to get the best deals. Maybe it's just me and my lack of knowledge
2023,1,"Not sure how the business model changed, but this site is no longer what it used to be originally. I use it just to search now a days and purchase directly from the airlines."
2023,1,"App doesn't work. After searching on a flight, shows no results and only a button saying search cheapest days."
2023,5,"Such an easy platform to use, search and find the best ticket, stay and transport, for whatever your travel priorities may be!"
2023,4,the prices vary on app and PC and on PC it recognizes me as robot :(
2023,5,"Nice interface, easy to use. I especially like the flexible days options."
2022,1,"Avoid. A single KAYAK design choice will be a deal breaker for most users. I've built my trip plan, landed overseas and started to add further events, until... ""This trip has reached the limit of events we can add to it; please create a new trip."" Ummm - no - please design an app that makes its constraints clear from the outset (this one is ridiculous). I recommend other users look at competing apps/software."
2018,3,"1) I Have set my CURRENCY to my Country, BUT, Strangely but true, each time I try to view a hotel to find out its prices, it automatically came back as ""£"" currency, so it's a shame cuz the pricing comparison is quite good actually. FIX that, meanwhile I will return to my usual App to check on prices & to book. 2) There aren't enough DESCRIPTIONS listed in each hotel I'm viewing, so i can't really figure out details i needed for each hotel I view/open."
2018,5,"Best app I've ever downloaded!! The 'Trips' feature is absolutely incredible, it lays out your whole trip with every single piece of information you could possibly need by retrieving the information from your confirmation emails - even if they weren't booked through Kayak! Can't express how much I love this app, has massively exceeded expectations!!"
2023,1,6 dollars a day for rental and then you check price $30 a day false advertisement should be a criminal offense 👎
2019,1,"The cheapest flights were offered by Crystal Travel, however, it is impossible to book any of these flights. After submitting payment details booking is declined due ""dynamic changes with availability of flights"". However, if you do another search, the same flight and price is returned by the Kayak app. This makes the app effectively useless as a search tool. (I wonder how legal this business model actually is??)"
2023,5,Excellent application to xompare the flights and travel!
2021,1,"Have been a user for many years and preffered this to other sites such as trippit. However Since one of the new updates, I have not been able to log into my account. I have tried resetting my password numerous times and it says that it will send me an email but I never seem to be getting it. I have tried doing it on the app and on the website but same issue. I have tried contacting them but again no response. I really do not want to loose my previous records."
2021,3,"Well I did like Kayak, but now every time I open it, it doesn't show me the prices next to the travel deals, it just says ""Info"", and I have to click throughto the airline site just to see the price. I'm hoping that's some weird glitch. I'm not going to click on every option 3 times just to see what the price it...kind of defeats the purpose of your app. I will uninstall this app in a damn hurry if it keeps wasting my time like this!"
2019,4,We booked our trip to Paris using Kayak. This is a great app. It has trip notification you can track the price drop and rises. Their when to buy when it's the cheapest was an excellent tool. We booked three tickets for under $700 each (estimated.) I gave a 4 star because I haven't use their hotel and car rental tools. I'm sure it's great.
2019,1,"Terrible experience. This new version had offers from many new sites. Every single one of them had an initial low price but after filling out all the required info, a popup announced that the price was no longer valid and of course after redoing it, the price had gone up well over $100. After 5 attempts, I gave up on this app."
2023,4,"The best available travel app. But it does have room to improve i.e. - the filters regarding number of checked luggage don't always work as intended, and therefore almost all results have to be manually checked. On car hire, different providers are listed of you change the country setting on the app e.g. you set the country as UK , and search for car hire in US, you will get less results than you get on the same so but with country set to US. Overall the best travel app I've come across."
2019,3,"Good idea but this app (or the website) just does not remember what filters you have applied. I try to input dates and it just doesn't show me flights for those dates (example: imputed dates in August, flights shown for May). Love the feature to see flights to anywhere with the map, just wish the filters actually worked"
2023,5,great site is easy to use ... great prices
2020,2,"From a software Product Manager: This has been my go-to flight search app for many years. Now, the search results show the lowest price from 10+ junk 3rd party booking sites that are generally considered horrible and risky. So the prices shown in list mode are not useful: ""Wow the Lufthansa flight is only $650"" - open flight - ""oh, it's actually $1200 from the airline, $650 is ""BudgetAir"". If there was a way to show the price from the Airline only, this would be useful again. Back to Orbitz."
2019,3,"App works well. But I catch flights in various parts of the world I rarely visit. It would be nice if Kayak provided some overview on airlines before we buy tickets. Their customer service, punctuality, cancelations, etc. I know what airlines to avoid in the US but not which ones to avoid in Asia for example. I would pay more for a ticket if I knew that it was less likely that I was going to wait an extra 12 hours due to a flight delay or cancelation"
2021,1,"Expedia is playing games on kayak. Expedia will list low price, when you click the link then they will raise 2x+ the price. Expedia some others ruining it. By publishing low rates and bump by charging 3x more. That's just ridiculous why kayak team looking into it. Expedia will ruin kayak for sure. Kayak must act on to fix this issue. Otherwise users will stop trusting this app. I sent you guys screenshot on the email in this app. Go ahead and check it out Sent info to kayak didn't do anything."
2022,1,"Not a fan. Booked a room in Kansas, checked in for less than an hour. Nothing was as stated. No breakfast, no fitness area, front desk grumbled after every question, as if I expected amenities from this location as if they were listed as highlights - THEY WERE. Told front desk I wanted a refund, haven't gotten one over a week later. Can't really approach Kayak about it, so they might want to fix that HUGE ISSUE."
2019,5,i dont use the kayak app for bookings but i do use it for my travel itinerary and i love it so much. it automatically syncs up with my gmail and puts all of my trip info into one concise easy to read platform. i travel a lot and use it all the time to keep track of my flights. it even lets me know down ti the second how long my layovers are or when flights are boarding. i dont know where id br without this app!
2023,1,"Maybe if I managed to use it my rating would be different. But app s unusable to me, it's crashing constantly."
2022,1,"Price Forecast sometimes is not shown, below price forecast sometimes there's a button that shows you the cheapest dates to fly to that destination but sometimes it doesn't show the button either, I have the latest app and have tried it on different phones so this is very frustrating. going back to Skyscanner"
2018,4,I love this app to keep all my trips together. Am using it for years. Only issue is delayed flights. Example: my wife is flying ET504 from DUB-LAX now. Flight got delayed 8.5 hours due to technical issues. Kayak did not recognize that and tells me the flight is on time. I live in San Diego and have to collect her in LAX. If I trusted Kayak for flight info I would have been waiting 8.5 hours in LAX. Instead I use flightradar24 for flight tracking. This has happened many times over the last 6 years that I am using kayak. Do not trust kayak for flight tracking.
2021,1,"Really frustrating and disappointing. Gave misleading rates to start with. Once I selected something with a rate I was comfortable with, started the booking process, entered payment information, and clicked the final step only to be told by the app the rate was no longer available and had gone up over 25%. I won't ever use this again."
2023,4,great app to compare travel and then book it with full integration with all your devices.
2022,1,"Kayak didn't update my confirmation number/ record locator when my flight changed so I couldn't check in at all. The app showed ""Access denied"" when I tried to check in on the app. Couldn't check in on the airline website because it technically didn't exist anymore. The airport was confused as well, and I missed my flight, but I just booked another one by just googling and checking prices. Kayak does not have options available to request refunds and there is no support line for you to call."
2018,3,"It's quite an annoying app to use. Everytime you want to edit your search, it resets absolutely everything to default. You cannot just change one field and refresh. And 70% of the costs shown are not what you see once you click into the flights."
2019,4,"Hi, I've been using Kayak since 2016 and I really enjoy the convenience of having all my trip information in one centralised location. I love competing with my friends on the travel statistics and it helps me keep my memories in archive so I can look back on. One thing I would love to see in the app is a carbon footprint tracker that shows how much carbon I've produced based on the distances I've travelled on my trips for each year. Do you think this will be possible?"
2018,4,"I've only searched for flights for anywhere on specific dates so far but wow, the results are very interesting. If the prices are as good as they seem to be then it may well change the way I go on holiday in the future. Could be the way forward for now to avoid being ripped off by stupid prices and even take advantage of the good ones. Won't know for sure until I've actually used it to book something though."
2023,3,"I can never order from the site. I always have to go directly to the airline. That being said, it is a great way to find which flights are available."
2018,4,"I have booked three awesome vacations with the explore tools. Only getting four stars because the incorrect pricing consistently breaks my heart. I hear a ticket is $400, click on it, it's $1200. More often than not. The gems are priceless, but you really have to dig."
2022,2,"Used to be my Go To app for all travel bookings. Now it seemingly tracks my IP address and shows higher prices in final results whereas I can clearly see lower prices when it is working on the results. Those low prices are nowhere to be found in final results. Also, what's the point of Senior Citizens category when it shows terribly long 12-15 hours layovers."
2023,5,"Last update broke ± days search option, always returns an empty reault. Update: 184.2 fixed the issue."
2019,3,"I always liked Kayak for fbookong flights until recently. The last three trips I tried to book my flights for, after clicking book, it tells me the flight is jo longer available on numerous different options. Since my info is saved in the system, the time from verifying the flight and cost till booking is just a minute or so. I do not believe that this is a just a coincidence, it has happened too many times. I believe they are leaving those prices up to entice people."
2022,4,"This is my default app for flight booking and I also like to gather details of upcoming trips here. There are a few details that could be improved: I find that the luggage preferences usually reset when I change search criteria, which is a bit of an annoyance."
2023,5,"It's a great app to compare prices over various websites - my suggestion though: double check if all websites are actually reliable before booking. For example, kissandfly is not reliable to book tickets from, so just check the prices and go to the airline's own website to see if it checks out, and maybe get your tickets from there. Very useful functions of searching with ±a few days."
2019,4,"Love the app. I use it all the time for researching my next trip. Only thing I wish was different is, I wish I could choose which airport to use the explore search from. It defaults to a local regional airport and the prices are hugely inflated. Other then that ,it's been good."
2022,1,"I don't know what's changed but it's now bloody useless. I put in my dates with +-3 days and I get the most RIDICULOUS suggestions: Berlin to Larnaca in 2 days for 450 euro, what the hell? If I go on easyJet and check manually I find flights at 1/3 cheaper with the expected travel time. I could have sworn there used to be a feature that tells you when airlines fly to a location and the option to see when in a month is cheap. Basically I'm uninstalling, the app sucks."
2023,1,Deceptive fares that don't exist. Slow and often unresponsive. Lately the orange search button does not respond to a click. You will see fares that will be half of the regular airline sites and you can book it but they are not legit and will be canceled so don't get hopes up. Even with the instant book through Kayak. When you click throw to a vendor site it hangs and doesn't let you go back. App right now is a waste of time.
2021,1,"Be very careful! Found good car rental price and it took me to carrental8 website and I reserved it. No phone number anywhere to call the company, emailed twice and no answer. Email is the only way to contact. Pickup location for car is Newark AIRPORT, 50 miles from home and I have no idea why, when I searched in my town. There is no address or anything, just say airport. To cancel is 40$ fee. Will handle with my credit company. But Kayak never again. You can't contact kayak either."
2020,4,"It would be cool if you would offer ""duration,"" ""weekend,"" and/or days of the week as part of your explore filters (in addition to date, price, distance, and theme). That way I could choose to only see trips that were on the weekend, or were four days long, or went from Thursday to Sunday, for examples."
2023,1,prices are not accurately updated and are usually much higher when you try to buy.
2023,3,"A well versed app for searching for flights, except the process appears seems to be nice expensive than others"
2023,2,"Newest 2023 update 'Recommended' a 55 hour long flight at a 25% higher price before showing me the ones that matched my search criteria (like only 1 stopover & no long layovers!) . Then it sent me to the airline's site to purchase the flight; it did not seem to register the trip in Kayak, where I was hoping to add trip insurance and hotel. Update did not remember my profile info for auto-filling, & put an Afghanistan phone prefix for a U.S.-based customer. Weird."
2022,1,"The app is great functionally, but customer service for processing refund request is not effective. Support staffs are not provided with adequate information and tool to efficiently and effectively help me with refund for a canceled flight. I have been working on my refund request since early August of 2021. I have used other 3rd booking apps and had good experience with refund. Avoid booking with through this app if possible."
2023,5,consistently great tool.
2023,5,they were able to find me the best fare one way in a major carrier
2023,1,this app broke three times after I had it installed.
2023,4,Pretty cool and easy to use
2019,4,"Trip feature very convenience and very useful. Search function is also very flexible with +/- option. But the display can be improved as current item by item takes time to read. If there is some grouping will be easilier to read. Compare to other travel app, Kayak is much more details."
2023,5,"It's easy to use and you will get variable flights information which is helpful. Every time I try other app, I always come back as Kayak is fantastic"
2023,1,"Flights to some countrys is restricted. 1 star ,when they choose not to mix politics into everything i will install this app again."
2023,1,"Caution: Deceptive Car Rental Experience at Airport Booked a car through Kayak, lured by low prices. Upon arrival, learned the rental service was 30 mins away from Toronto airport. Discovered alarming scam warnings on Google Reviews. Kayak offered no help to cancel or report this. Felt misled and trapped in a potentially fraudulent situation. Advice to travelers: double-check rental locations and read reviews before booking. Avoid this service for a hassle-free experience."
2023,2,"I'm trying to use the app to buy tickets, but every flight is a ""Self-transfer"" flight. There's no option to disable this. (You can do it on the website but not in the app for some reason) This majes the app almost unusable unfortunately."
2023,1,This app sucks! I'm sick and tired of it making me solve a puzzle because of potential bot activity. This happens when I'm logged in. Plus I solve the puzzles and it says I didn't. Pure garbage!
2022,3,"Like this app very much But... I use Kayak app ragularly to book flights. As I use my mobile for pretty much everything I use the app for searching of flights more frequently than the Web site. In general the app is great as meets all my needs BUT... When searching for flights the option to omit return flights which do return to the same airport is not available On the app, which available on the website!! Could you please please make it available on the app!!!"
2019,1,"Was a huge fan of kayak (web). App was always less convenient. Lately web service got worse. 2 days ago my flight got cancelled. Airline was not giving me my desired reroute option claiming nothing was available. I checked kayak app and really nothing came up. Then my co-passenger found an option that worked for me. I took that ticket and even after holding said ticket in my hand kayak app still didn't find it. We're talking Warsaw-Paris-Tbilisi, not Somalia to Mogadishu if you know what I mean."
2023,1,"One of the worst booking experiences in my life. My flight was canceled and they did not refund me until 3 months had passed. Very slow customer service, I had to contact the airlines myself to prove that the flight was canceled because Kayak said they couldn't (that airlines allegedly never respond to them). They will try to find any way not to refund you. I called them a hundred times and kept pushing. Never use them ever! Heed my warning! ⚠️"
2019,4,"I used this app to book my trip over seas and was informed by the hotel I booked thru Agoda (thru the Kayak app) that it would be closed down due to government regulations. I canceled but was informed that thru the app that I wouldn't get a refund. Agoda is untrustworthy. They stole money. update: Agoda did refund my money after some communications and things worked out. booked another trip this time thru Kayak but it doesnt show up in the ""My Trips"" section. not sure why"
2022,3,"Deal are usually with third party wholesalers and not directly with the airlines. I avoid wholesalers simply because if there is a flight itinerary problem you usually spend a fortune on multiple calls to an Indian call center (Expedia ). Kayak is good for researching fares however, if you want security, book flight directly with the airlines."
2019,2,Had this app for awhile and went to book a flight through this. Didnt matter which way I did it whether through the book now link or through the view details and then proceed to booking it would not go through. I ended up going through the airline direct. Okay to browse through for flights but would not recommend to do your bookings through them.
2018,1,Better book your own flight via airline websites!! The app suggested two connecting ryanair flights via an online travel agent that ended up costing 103 pounds. They also had a deadline 48 hours prior to do online checkin. I would then have had to pay 110 euro ryanair fees to check in at the airport. I booked a much cheaper Easy Jet direct flight instead and lost my 103 pound flight via Kayak. Will be apprehensive about using kayak in future!
2023,1,"re: trips, new update frequently logs out, for some reason. at least once a day. when it is logged out, you can't see details of your trip, which defeats half of the purpose. if this isn't fixed SOON, going to have to switch to tripit or something."
2023,3,"I like your app and I use it all the time, however, I have been scammed by Mytrip which I bought my ticket through and scammed me as I showed up to the airport and informed me that the flight has been cancelled. I didn't receive any emails regarding this!!!! Plus when I contacted them, they asked me for an assistant fee which a paid, then they stopped replying to my emails!!!"
2022,4,"Good app but beware when you pick to purchase your booking. Do not book anything if its link to Tripmonster. This company base in EU and it will usually cancel your booking at last minute and not notified you. They probably sell your seats or room at a higher price!. Also you they will get charged 50 EU for each ticket. if you cancel your flights, even within 24 hours. BEWARE!"
2020,1,"TURO FROM HERE ON OUT Booked a car rental and was charged by THIS APP for the service/assistance and upon arriving to the airport I was told there was no record of my reservation and an additional 250 would be required for ""deposit purposes"" more than doubling the original quote. AND THEN I GET AN AUTOMATED EMAIL ASKING HOW WAS MY RENTAL. Y'all are funny. I stand by my words"
2022,4,"Kayak , flight booking are good and faster. But one drawback. For instance for ticket booking from UAE to India flights kayak have linked to 2 or agencies , where the ticket price given are perfect and good. But while selecting additional facility like seats(indian airline will charge aed 15 for selecting a seat whereas to kayak or travelgenio I paid aed 37/- per seat. For 1 person paying aed 37 is fine. But for 4 members , to and fro the total cost around aed Aed 296/-, a loss)"
2023,5,"Gives a great starting (and usually finishing) point. By searching so many sites they save a lot of time. Also, as an example, if you are looking for a hotel room, you can decide if Hotelsdotcom price is low enough that their loyalty program is worthwhile. Sometimes the other sites offer a price more than ten percent lower."
2019,5,Many filtering options in a user friendly interface. Not all the airlines are listed but coverage is constantly expanding. Previous payment was unsuccessful so I find the best flights and book them independently
2023,5,"Kayak is great, but recently the app doesn't show the date at the begining of the days activities in the selected trip. This is a bug with dark mode, but even when disabled it doesn't show dates, just a solid white bar. It does work on my Samsung phone but not on this one (Poco)."
2019,1,This has recently gone from the best travel organizer app to the worst! What have they done to it? It rarely opens and the front screen hangs indefinately. Sometimes need to restart my phone to increase the chance that it may then open after a bit of time. And this IS the most up to date version.
2023,5,"Pretty good. Shows the most flights, best fares, lots of filter options. Wish you could select total travel duration instead of just leg of flight and layover but love that feature too. Used to have Southwest fares too but now have to price those separately. Overall a fantastic app. My go to"
2021,3,Rental listings that I have been looking at in New Jersey show a nightly price of less than $200 and when you go to book now it takes you to VRBO where the nightly price is about double what it's showing on Kayak. This is the first time I've experienced this so I'm not sure if there's something wrong with the connection to VRBO
2019,5,"this is an excellent tool to search costs for all your travel needs. In most instances, costs have been the same from 1 site to the next. I ONLY use this as a tool, a starting point for cost. it most excellent for rental car comparison."
2023,4,"A little harder to use filters and less straightforward than the website, but overall a good app. When booking, it takes about 10-30 seconds for the payment to be confirmed. I guess that's because it has to go through several 3rd parties."
2019,3,"The booking site filter is useless. I remove several booking sites I don't trust, and the fare it shows me for every flight is still the one from those sites. So even though I applied the filter, I still need to check the flights one by one to make sure the price I see on the search list is coming from a site I trust."
2019,5,By far the best travel App out there. the App is very stable and never crashes. It saves everything from game tickets to hotel reservations and travel documents in app for easy access. I can also book my entire trip minus train tickets right from this app. It is the perfect companion for any traveler.
2019,4,"Hello, Just a quick suggestion. In you explore option, when trying to set the price value, it is very difficult on a phonr. To set a specific maximum. Is it possible to add the option to input this number manually? Thank you"
2020,4,"Reliable app and great service. My only wish is that it would open to the trips page. I'm usually looking there when I open it, not to book hotels, cars, etc. Maybe others are, but I'd rather set that preference if possible."
2022,2,"I like this app, I've never had an issue with any of my reservations. What I really dislike and is very discouraging is when while you're browsing hotels it shows the amount for a reservation, but when you try to actually book a room the price is quite a bit more expensive."
2020,1,"Such a useless, piece of garbage app. No idea why it's so highly rated. Refuses to show the full estimated price for car rentals instead of per day (even though website shows the full rates just fine). Also what's the point of putting pick-up/drop-off times in the search field when the results just ignore them completely and show agencies that aren't open anywhere near those times?"
2019,5,"Simple Program that aggregates all information in one spot. Allowed check on with Delta, access to email booking without leaving the application. Just didn't get seat assignments updated. We shared airline, hotel and rental information on Kayak. No annoying ads or pop-ups."
2019,5,"Absolutely love this app! Has made booking my last few international trips a breeze. Love how many options it comes up with, and that it allows you to sort by length, price etc. Never use anything else when I'm booking flights."
2019,5,"Excellent experience. Very user friendly, intuitive, responsive, effective, smooth, and delivers money saving results. It saved me hundreds on an international flight. I highly recommend it!"
2021,1,"I booked a car in tulum with kayak, when I went to pick up my car I was told by Budget that they have NO cars. It cost me $30 in taxi to get to the budget office. The guy also told me that it happens all the time. Meaning, they are booking cars that are not available at cheaper rates, and then force you to rent at twice the rate. This is a racket. That must stop."
2022,2,"Very wacky pricing. Green on calendar is supposed to be the cheapest, but often is hundreds more than a neighboring date with no color at all. Why not get with the times and show pricing on the calendar like other more useful apps? Or are you hoping we buy the more expensive ticket for greater kickback? Either way, uninstall."
2023,4,"Fast & comprehensive. It would be nice to have default settings on some of the ""filters"". For example, I never use non-airline booking sites and I have to manually select it with every new search. The same for ""group by alliance""."
2022,5,I actually really like this application because it is easy fast and reliable. I have booked a long trip ticket to Africa and I wasn't sure if this app was satisfying. The costumer service was amazing they care about your happiness making sure you get what you ask for. After I booked my ticket they emailed and called me to making sure that was really me that booked the ticket which I thought that was very important thing to do so customer service is one hundred percent true to there customers.
2018,3,"When trying to add an email to my account so I can forward itineraries from it, when I get the request to associate email in the inbox I am trying to add, it asks if I want to associate this account with my main account, but there is no button or way to accept the invite on the email received. This is very frustrating!!"
2021,5,"Great, but every time I try to ""travel like a pro"" a pop-up with the google Play Store link to Google Services for AR opens, which only allows me to open pictures of the services app. After it's dismissed, Kayak just fails to ""create an AR session"". Update: issue fixed in version 133."
2023,4,"The app won't even start. I open it and it's just an orange screen with the title. Maybe there was a bad update, but it's not working. I'll change my review if it changes behavior. P.s it's not my phone, I have an S22 Ultra."
2019,2,"Useless outside US. Skyscanner far better for flight info. It searches a small selection of airlines and gives severely inflated pricing. Used to be solid. Now its uninstalled as there are other, better apps that do what this does, better than this does."
2022,1,I used kayak a lot in the past but since my last experience I won't anymore. Booked what I thought was a full size SUV directly through their app. Picture and description stated that it was a full size SUV but received a confirmation email from Sixt stating I was only receiving a compact SUV. Contacted both companies numerous times to ask for a refund but both refused. Clearly feel this is Kayaks fault though as they did not advertise correctly what Sixt was offering.
2022,5,"My go to app for travel reservations. Been using it for years, have tried others but keep coming back to Kayak. Love all the filters! If I could change one thing, the app should remember my preferred sort order."
2023,1,"The filters have a button ""Sites"" listing ""Airlines Only"" when you remove select all and then airlines only, it will still show all booking sites. Whatever you try it will ignore the filter. Worst of all, when having problems booked through an agent, Kayak refused to help and even still lists that agent!!!"
2018,1,"Rubbish app! Watching flights for weeks, app says the one of the options we were looking at was £590 All the other options went up in price but the £590 flights were still there according to kayak yet we click on them and the price jumps to around £750 pp. Come back and run the search again, still says Cheapest flights are £590 when they aren't there! Nonsense app. Rubbish"
2023,2,"searching for flights keep giving error after last update. I cleared the cache and restarted app, still the same. uninstalled app, restarted phone, and installed Kayak again. worked for 1 search, then gives error again when searching for flights. recommends sending a feeback. Please fix newest update. It was fine until then. Thanks."
2022,1,Booked the hotel through this app and and paid up front (to traveluro)... Got suspicious and checked reviews. They were really bad and I canceled immediately... took me over 3 months to get almost $1800 back. Never had this trouble with any other hotel booking service and will never use kayak again.
2019,1,Purchased a flight through kayak from delta. Plans changed a month before I was to fly so I canceled my flight. I ate $333 because Delta doesn't refund these 2nd party tickets fully. The remaining $53 of my ticket purchase can only be used as credit on another Delta flight. NO REFUND! Best to purchase from the Delta app directly if you're flying with them. I will be driving from now on.
2019,5,This app has always been my go to when trying to plan and schedule for trips. It makes everything so much more accessible and flexible to my routine. They even put up different websites selling a same ticket at similar or more affordable prices.
2019,5,Great App I'm usually not too trusting with people I can't see or talk to face to face. But I have tried this app on a few vacations the last few years and I always feel unsure if I am going to get taken by one of the services Kayak recommends to use to get the biggest discount. After traveling in Chicago Miami Atlanta New York Brussels and Africa. and a few stops in-between. They have earn my Thanks and Praise. Be smart be safe and secure. Use This App .
2018,5,"It's practical, reliable and it finds the best deals. My go-to app/site when buying plane tickets. I have yet to use the other features (rental car, hotels, etc.) but I'll give it a try at some point."
2021,5,I realize kayak is just a portal to connect people with other travel options. I've really enjoyed using the app and I really enjoyed all of the things I found while searching for different trips. Make sure to practice your due diligence though.
2022,1,"I have deleted this app now, the prices that show on this app are not the same when you move to that website. I used it like 10 times but turned out complete waste of time as prices are higher when you move to that website. The company should focus on app development rather than marketing, once the app is doing what it is supposed to do in real time then the app will market itself."
2019,1,"Tried to buy a flight but the ""Purchase"" button doesn't work. Edit in response to Kayak response (and downgrading to 1 star). Thank you for the irrelevant response. It's literally Kayak's ""Purchase"" button that wouldn't take me to the third party site to purchase, so I skipped you and did so directly. Also, Kayak does directly sell some tickets as agent so you're wrong."
2020,4,A pretty good app for searching airfares etc. However I once booked a flight from the US to Windhoek Namibia. My flights allowed only one hour to change planes in Johannesburg. Apparently it is universally known that any connection in Johannesburg takes 3 hours. But I didn't know that and neither did the algorithm at Kayak. Of course I missed the connection and had a huge hassle that nearly ruined my trip! Don't assume that Kayak knows anything!
2022,5,"I travel a fair amount. I have developed many of my own efficiencies that have proven quite useful-- this app makes most of my efforts redundant, as it automates and streamlines my itineraries and reservation info. A genuinely useful app for people travel."
2022,1,"Avoid. Lots of untrustworthy travel agents in this app. I booked a flight that lead me to a horrible Gotogate scam website. Initially, the price seem to be low until you check out and add in keeps on piling up that you end up paying almost the same as a others. Very deceitful. This is just the first stretch of the horrible experience I had using the app. The other part is from Gotogate. Will never use this app ever again. I contacted a popular Canadian investigative journalist to do an expose."
2022,3,i used this app alot. i travel frequently and recently the prices seemed too high. i checked the same flight on other people's phones and the same flight would be significantly lower. kinda feel like they are riping me off since i would use them often and didn't compare prices
2019,5,"I love this app. It allowed me to book air tickets for my domestic travel in US from India for the most economic price that was not available anywhere else. They have a special feature called ""Hacker Price"" which gives you the cheapest option available at that time."
2022,5,Kayak is such a wonderful AND useful app. It seems like they know before the airlines when the flights true arrival time is whether earlier or later. Saved me plenty of times from unnecessary waits whether picking up someone or catching a fight myself. Keep up the great work.
2020,4,"There is one small issue in app. When you search for a date e.g. 10/22 and get results, the results do not show the full date as 10/22. It displays as 10/2. One digit gets cut off and need to visit each result to see what is the date of result in case +/- 3 days results are selected."
2020,1,"Fails to show resort fees up front. For example, it shows the Venetian in Vegas is $83 but of course you won't find out about the absurd $51 resort fee until you've gone through countless booking steps. That’s very shady; will use Expedia instead since they show resort fees up front."
2020,4,"Works well but lacks desktop features. I would definitely give the app 5 starts if it asked me to search packages as well as select the ""all inclusive"" filter when searching for resort properties without the flight."
2020,1,App froze and shut down when finishing payment. I now have no idea if I just bought $700 worth of plane tickets or not or if I still need to buy them. The flights didn't allow cancellations and I haven't recieved any confirmation email or texts about the flights. Now I'll have to wait a day to see whether the purchase went through or not. If it didn't I will definitely buy my tickets elswhere.
2023,1,"have this app on my phone, before it WAS user friendly, but it wouldn't allow me to scroll down hotel list on my laptop. I selected Nuevo Vallarta, so the top two on the list, couldn't select but the top hotel. Lots of apps now, try to sell too much. Deleted it."
2021,3,"Would like to be able to scan larger areas for rental cars. Cumbersome to have to keep picking cities in counties, going back and forth instead of scanning the entire country or for that matter all of Europe for the best car deal."
2021,1,"SCAMMERS! Used this app to buy a flight tickets. Send me on SmartFare. They took the money $2450 and I didn't get a tickets, but I received confirmation. Called them next day, told me that the price had changed and I have to pay 40$ extra for each ticket! I got 2 tickets for me and my son! And asked me if I authorize this transaction. Then I checked my card they overcharged me 142$! I called customer service they asked me what I don't like?! Its been May 26th 2021. NO MONEY BACK!!!!"
2021,1,Extremely disappointing with the app! Even though we found a hotel; kayak refuses to stop sending email after email when I have them turned off!!! Strongly recommended not to use the app unless you LOVE endless emails 20 times a day 24/7.
2022,1,"This app used to be great for finding cheap flights and cheapest dates. Lately on my app the days are no longer colored green for cheapest red for most expensive or white for normal pricing they're just white. And the flights are ridiculously expensive I can go to the airline website and find cheaper flights than I can on this app. Please do better, I seriously used to use this app at least 5-6 times a month now I barely even bother."
2019,2,"The app worked great, and Ioved it, right up until it updated last, now it won't ""connect to google play services"", so I can't use the explore function. edit in response to developer: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app from the google play store, and the error persists."
2022,2,Used to be great. Now all these sites are in bed with a certain airline getting kickbacks for showing them instead of competitors. Ever wonder why all the best deals are the same airline? Look at other sites. You'll see the three other teams. Shameful. Might as well avoid the middle man and shop all the airline pages like before.
2019,4,"I have used it to book a recent trip. Multi-leg, complicated international itinerary. I simultaneously sent confirmations to another travel site for comparison and Kayak deciphered all of the bookings correctly (the other site did not) Thank you!"
2022,4,"I like this app, the only thing I don't like is the fact that no matter what I do, there is an error when trying to link the app to my google account. It keeps saying ""Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"" and the description says I cannot link it, because the app does not comply with Google OAuth 2.0 policy. Not sure what to think about that. Also I can't add my phone number, because there is a very short list of countries, Czechia is not one of them and I can't get past that."
2020,1,"Absolutely has some good things, but... impossible to delete recent searches, even after deleting cache and data and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. And I don't have an account. I guess the app recognises the device. What kind of privacy control is that?? And what does that say about other things it might do with your data?"
2023,1,"Lost $450 because I set currency to CAD in the app, but prices were actually still posted in USD. Didn't find out until the non-refundable bill for the flight came. Thanks for that, most expensive app I've ever used. Nice UI."
2019,5,Kayak is an excellent app for finding cheap flights from any airport or surrounding airports. There's a cool feature that allows you to browse cheap flights if you're looking for any random place to go with no definite dates.
2023,5,"So far I'm loving the ease of use and selections on Kayak. I haven't actually travelled through a booking yet, but I am planning to book my New Zealand trip through Kayak this year. We compared prices with the airline directly and the tickets were more expensive through them than with Kayak. Idk how they do it, but THANK YOU KAYAK!"
2023,1,Lists too many sites which fraudulently show a price lower than the actual price available when you click through. So you end up visiting each on to find out if they are really the best deal in any case. May as well use Google.
2020,1,"The new press and hold requirement is just a mess, I have to repeat the steps 4-5 times till it starts working, when I click on it, it runs but then it does nothing, repeating a few times till it starts."
2023,5,"I like that I'm able to see the price of flights as a total price Inc luggage and also easily be able tweak the dates for the best price. I always use Kayak as my main site for flights and find the prices are hard to beat. There are many sites out there that advertise very cheap prices but they show prices from and when you get the real price it is always 2 to 3 times what was advertised, I don't even bother checking those B***S*** sites anymore."
2023,2,"I am not sure why you think it is a good idea to add ""Mobile Key HCE Example"" to my NFC popup which interferes with my normal digital key. I had to uninstall the app until this is fixed..."
2023,4,"I love this app. The explore function is really neat, but it won't let me change my home airport. It defaults to my closest airport which is a tiny expensive one. I want to see the rate for a big city airport an hour away on the explore function. Please fix!"
2023,4,"Would like to have easier/better access to the best deals from my location in a given time period, otherwise it's great, comprehensive listings, just wish flights were cheaper, and that's nothing to do with kayak"
2023,5,"Gives great advice on airline tickets,hotels and car rental !!!!"
2023,5,"I use Kayak to find best prices for flights cars, and hotels. One of the best apps I use."
2023,4,"The app works really well, but requires a great deal of input from the user to get the best prices. Also, third party sellers feature too prominently, and their fares are usually fake. Other than that, I won't change much."
2020,1,"As described by other poster, when looking at one way flights, it will not let you select or input departure. Uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times now and still not right. Also, when this is happening, if I click in the x to close the select departure / destination page nothing happens. I have to close out the app."
2022,1,I'm never booking my flights or hotels through kayak again. Had a horrible experience for booking a hotel room. Absolutely no accountability at all. They haven't resolved or bothered to solve the issue even though I have been following up since the last five months.
2021,1,"They were great but then they added sub par car rental agencies to their searches. We rented a car through Kayak with an agency called Carzi in Phoenix and it went downhill from there. We were traveling to Phoenix and they canceled our reservation only a couple hours before we were supposed to pick up. They refused to give us another vehicle at the same, or any price, and now we are stuck"
2023,3,Purely based on the car rental and in the age of customer centric app design - the Kayak app can do better. I cant select transmission preferences I cant filter by budget I cant filter by model I appreciate simplicity but it doesn't mean you cannot offer bells and whistles.
2018,1,"When I booked a flight for my employee, the credit card was charged immediately but no evidence for the booking was sent. Only part of the name of the charging business was appeared in the credit card charging list. A nice way to still money. BE CAREFUL !!!"
2019,5,"I have been using Kayak on both iOS (now iPad OS) and Android and now Android One seamlessly. It has been a great experience so far!! To make this experience still better, it would be great to have higher and faster refresh rates for flight/gate/terminal that are added to thepersonal trips."
2022,1,"Not all as it seems. Booked flights, lengthy process, Kayak gave cheaper than other quotes for the flight. Then just before I hit 'book' it bumped up the price by a thousand dollars. It's an old con. Be warned. Uninstalled. UPDATE REPLY TO KAYAK: This reply simply isn't true. I was on the phone with a travel agent when trying to make the booking on Kayak. From the start, the agent told me the flights I was booking on Kayak weren't available. This was only confirmed at the end of my Kayakbooking."
2019,3,"Oct. 12, 2019: There's no easy way to get to Alerts. *It's NOT intuitive to go to: Profile->Notifications->Email ->Alerts* There should be a button at the top of the Main page when opening the app for Alerts. Other reviewers are struggling with this, too."
2019,1,"It's not working! Whenever I try to search for airports, it tells me ""no results found"". Works a couple times after I force stop the app, but then always goes back to not showing anything. Useless, gonna switch to skyscanner."
2019,3,Good app but there's a bug where only the first digit of the date is shown on the left. Makes it impossible to pick a flight when dealing with multiple dates.
2023,5,WARNING : ACE CAR RENTAL IN MARATHON FL & KEY WEST FL. RENTALS ARE LIMITED RANGE USE!
2023,3,Can't share information with my travel.partners searches are blocked
2023,5,"nice application, personally it's ai feature which compare the best and cheapest flights. I tottally trust this app"
2023,5,Have been using this app for years. It's ny first stop for finding travel options.
2021,2,"When selecting dates for a hotel, it's quite easy to select the departure date; but for some reason the arrival date sliding selector is nearly impossible to use. Which negates the whole point of this application for myself."
2021,1,"If there an option for 0 stars I would use it, booked a flight in Mexico city and received a confirmation number, later the flight information was wrong and calling the airline they tell me that our names are not booked and didn't know about the reservation. Really a huge scam!!"
2019,2,Why oh why would you take one of the best features of kayak and bury it like 3 levels deep in the settings?! How in the world does it not make sense to keep it in the sidebar main menu? Are you trying to discourage use of it or what?!
2023,4,"works pretty good, but sometimes a bit redundant and some of the suggestions lead down the rabbit hole of clicking, usually ending in a waste of time. Overall good to use to check ."
2023,5,Great service and booking options
2022,5,"After searching for almost 4 days for a flight, I had to settle for a rental car. I was already in a rental car and complaining about the cost until someone told me to download the KAYAK app and look for a flight. I was so lucky when I found a flight that was leaving my location in about 3 hours. I felt so grateful that I found that flight and I will always recommend this app for anyone who is having trouble finding a flight!"
2019,3,"I've sent a number of past itinerary emails, however, I'm not seeing any travel stats. Is it working as intended? Does it only calculate stats of travels I've only taken after I installed the app? Would love to hear the feedback. Thanks."
2022,5,"Great App! Love Kayak, just used them for a long international trip, from booking, pricing and during your trip you'll receive flight reminders, info about the flights, gate numbers, flight status, baggage claim belt numbers, etc. just excellent, very useful! New fan here!"
2021,2,"App is unusable; ""could not start search"" whenever I look for hotels. Search works on desktop and I'm able to save a search under alerts, but even pulling up the saved search in the app returns ""could not start search""."
2023,5,Very handy Andy easy to use. I like that there is searchoption with luggage and flexibility dates as well as suggestions for the cheapest flight option.
2023,1,will not let you select a different city to stay in from where you are arriving
2023,1,This app sucks! It wont completely load the home screen. Cant search or do anything
2023,1,"It was going so well, I liked the flexibility of filters but when I click on ""view deal"" I just get a blank screen. Uninstalling."
2023,5,My favorite app to check for flights! I love the explore feature also
2023,5,"Good sorting, good deal hunting. Best travel app IMO."
2023,4,The searches are pretty good. I would like to see EV charging as amenities to inform my choice
2023,5,Best way to find the Best flights at the Best prices! I always check kayak first!
2020,4,"Like this app a lot.. especially the stats for my trips. Not sure why it's added some of my future trips into my travel stats though, surely your stats should only be for trips completed? Am sure the developers will get onto this though as the rest of the app is slick and handy. :)"
2022,1,This app is scam...I just booked an international ticket now. But didn't get the exact date have been booked. When asked the trip that they booked for asking now for additional payment. They booked me not Jeddah to Manila back and forth when coming back only in Dubai not in Jeddah. Now have big issue calling the trip they have booked with. There's no one to talked where to email. Please fix this kayak. I don't pick my money on the street. Am working every cent am earning. !!!
2023,5,Useful to at least help plan prices! I've bought from them and had no issues.
2019,1,"Do not waste your time it's rubbish. It would show you ticket price and when you click on it to book , it would redirect you to site and price would be change and would be expensive. Worthless to download."
2021,2,It was very complicated to use this app when I needed it it didn't help me at all it keeps popping up on other apps when I don't even need it haven't even asked for it so they need to get their abs straightened out otherwise yes it would probably help me if it worked right but on this phone that I'm using right now it is not working right on this Metro T-Mobile phone so I'm sure other people had good luck with it but me I haven't had no good luck with it on the phone I'm using it this time
2019,2,"The app regularly hangs and takes multiple minutes to load basic screens (everything else loads on my phone instantly while this hang is occurring). It also regularly drops searches and suggests I send feedback, although the mechanism to send these crash reports is unclear."
2023,4,Great for refining your flight search but the bug that won't me allow to choose airlines only (to avoid all the random OTAs that I've never heard of and that I wouldn't book with anyway) diminishes the experience
2018,5,Kayak is one of the Top flight search applications. Reliable upto 95% or more. You can easily find and filter to reach out to the cheapest fast fares. I recommend it. Good work.
2019,4,excellent bandwidth. needs a for airfare: 1) I like day of week search but does not include baggage filters. 2) Multi City search does not include baggage filters. need option to set filters up front.
2019,2,"when i click on explore, nothing happens. it just shows me a map. why haven't you been able to fix this issue yet? i love the web site, but your app isn't good at all! The filters don't exist. It's a bug that I'm reporting to you."
2023,3,"Kayak found many deals like other search engines, however I made the mistake of assuming vendors that Kayak found were good vendors. Learned my lesson the hard way. Do your research and check ratings closely. Dealing with Priceless Car Rental was bait and switch, not to mention add-on after add on....."
2023,5,"Great service, easy to use."
2023,5,Great application! Helps me plan every Trip
2023,4,great travel search engine
2023,5,Love the accuracy of the app.
2023,4,Did you find a result that looks good? Or was it because I used a debit card first? Or...?
2023,1,"Horrible algorithm now, either airlines are paying you now to boost them or your programmers are destroying your app."
2023,5,very easy to use
2020,1,The worst ever in this pandamic i got blocked in my country and the situation not clear here so they sent me an email wich is not good for me because of the situation to where i live so i called them to make a settlement they told if you want to change it will cost you 790$ wich is too expensive than if i will rebook a new ticket it is a kind of fraud even i sent them an email no answer what kind of app is this it is my first experience with this app and it will be the last also i recommend no
2023,5,best of the best travel app
2023,5,best price for my trip out of all the top sites
2021,2,My G-mail stopped syncing with the app and now it won't let me reconnect. Every time I hit G-mail it is non-responsive. I saw the same issue in an earlier review. Hopefully they fix this issue soon as that's my main reason for using this app.
2023,5,Sometimes you don't tell us how many bags for some flying
2019,3,Not as good as the full website where you have a tick option to leave AND return to same airport and not mix airports. Indispensable when you're driving to the airport.
2023,5,"wow, my first online check-in. easier than I expected. thank you"
2023,5,"Excellent site for everything you need (flights, hotels, rental car)."
2023,1,"Poor search engine,everything it shows is unavailable for the selected dates"
2023,4,"Excellent apps, quick , shows best rates and comparison"
2023,5,"Best for me .. tells me times , prices,the best time to travel.."
2023,2,I have downloaded the app three times and it still won't launch..I don't know what the problem is.
2023,5,"Clean, quick, great responsive design - love it!"
2023,5,A fantastic easy to navigate and delivers quick results
2023,5,My go to app for many years for finding and comparing flights for business and leasure
2023,5,lots of filters and options to find just what you're looking for
2023,5,so far I've had no problem with kayak and usually they have great prices
2023,5,excelente way to check for flight prices and more .
2023,5,good app to get the cheapest flights and hotels. great app.
2023,5,"great app, easy to use, great deals on flights"
2023,2,"Latest update broke the app, multi-day searches return blank results"
2023,1,Sign in with google doesn't work on app. Error 403: disallowed_useragent
2023,5,I have to find a new way to track the pending trips after Google stopped supporting their trips app. This one does a really good job. It picks up the travel information from confirmation emails that come to my Gmail.
2023,5,It's good for me to book airlines tickets
2023,4,"I found really great deals with this app. Giving this feedback only to ask to add one function. Please add in ""explore"", the possibility to find one way tickets (without the way back), useful for smartworkers."
2023,5,I love this app! Very useful and accurate! Totally recommend!
2020,3,Month and date is truncated (10/21 displays as 10/2) on the search results screen. Very inconvenient. I am using a samsung S2 tablet. I do not have this issue with other apps at this time.
2023,5,I've been using it for a long time and its good Thank you
2023,5,"Kayak had become one of my go-to sites to search for flights and hotels. I use several for cross checking, but it rarely fails me. Instead of using the third parties to book, i go to the airline sites and book direct so there's no hassle if issues arise."
2019,5,"Exceptional - saved a lot of money creating own trips. Saved more than travel agents. Please add a search function allowing to choose Airbus or Boeing etc, followed by model number."
2022,2,"Doesn't include deals, which are the main reason I use the Kayak website. Flight tracking and alerts are good, but prices are often more expensive or not available on clicking through to the vendor (esp. with Priceline), which is annoying."
2023,1,I always used this platform to search for the best deals on flights but I have noticed multiple times flights cheaper better options on the website of the carriers. I won't use this product anymore.
2023,1,"I Bought a Flight Ticket from Los Angeles To Hawaii ( OGG ). I got it for 248 Dollars and 16 Dollars for the Insurance. So Next day We went to the Airport And Guess What ? THERE WAS NO TICKET, THEY CANCELED OUR TICKET WITHOUT LETTING US KNOW. That's not Fair. Plus, the United custumer service is not Profesional. Everything was Terrible. Now! I'm gonna se If they Can refund me the Money Back. Don't buy tickets in this Company or whatever it is."
2022,2,"Been using Kayak for some time now but recently it's just not been working, at all. I am not able to login or book a flight. Keeps on bringing 'search failed' message on the screen. I updated my phone to android 13 then this started happening."
2021,1,"Before you book using Kayak, check the actual airline websites. If you are traveling overseas, you will see that this app in many cases offers flights at an extremely high price compared to airline sites and the travel time to your destination can be twice as long. Do better Kayak."
2021,5,"Kayak is charging a change fee also when the airline company itself isn't charging, and also in this difficult time. From now on, I will check twice before I am placing the order via kayak, and I will prefer to order directly from the airline's website. (for example, my last flight cost the same on kayak and on the airline's website, but I was lazy and ordered via kayak, and now I am paying the price)"
2020,5,"Works well but lacks desktop features. I would definitely give the app 5 starts if it asked me to search packages as well as select the ""all inclusive"" filter when searching for resort properties without the flight."
2023,2,"Update - I hate that when I put in my luggage requirements, KAYAK can't give me a price. When I am traveling international, I and everyone else will have luggage. This just sucks. KAYAK is good for estimating the costs to travel but sometimes it is not the most convenient flight times."
2020,1,"it works on my tablet, but not on my phone. my tablet has android 10 system, my cellphone has a android 7 system. when I use it on my phone, it will not display the search result no matter how long i wait. i think it's the app's bug."
2021,1,Need a way to communicate with customer service on this app. I'm still trying to get a refund from a flight that was cancelled by the airline. The 3rd party company has not helped and I know that it is not required to use them. I'll change my review after someone resolves this with me.
2018,2,"Not upto the expectation. App says it provides cheap, but other alternatives like farefirst provide better deals than this app. I would highly recommend the latter app than this kayak. I liked search ui and few other things in this app though, but result wise farefirst has always shown me deals which are better by far. I am uninstalling this app for now."
2023,1,Booked a trip with mytrip. Called and called for refund or reschedule because of being exposed to covid. Airline mention I should receive a refund and only the 3rd party can refund. After 3 phones calls with the company mytrip they keep mentioning the airlines policy states they cannot help with refund or reschedule. DO NOT BOOK WITH MYTRIP. No Manager to help or take a call.
2022,1,"Couldn't modify car rental date, called to car rental service and they couldn't change it, called to Priceline and they couldn't change it. I would recommend people to be completely be sure if they want to book from here"
2019,5,"Probably the best of all the travel apps, and I have tried quite a few. Would be good to have the option for selecting any destination as a search option."
2022,5,Trips are wonderful for organising travel bookings before and during travel. Functionality has improved. Everything U need I'm one place with minimal fuss.
2019,1,"poor customer service, beware, i lost hundreds of dollars. the first ticket payment seemed to fail so i bought another ticket. got 2 emails even though it's the same name and same flight. put in a cancel request on one and then tried to call. after waiting on the quest a long time i gave up. then the next day they told me i had to call to confirm the cancellation. i emailed back and told them i am indeed confirming the cancellation. no need to make customers call. waiting still for response."
2019,3,"Was working well, but now it's taking 2 to 3 minutes to load after updating the app & then the Android version to the latest patch. Granted the wifi is shared, but other activities are not comparably slow."
2018,4,Frustrating that there isn't a progress bar anymore to show that all results have been loaded. Otherwise app is still the best for searching flights
2022,1,I had worst day today because of some kind of muck up. I had made an booking for $211.43. But while I was communicating with rental car agency. They told me it would cost $330+. It cost me mental distress and screwed up entire day. I didn't get the I'm looking for options to sort this out. Looking forward to hearing from you.
2022,1,DEAR VERY CAREFULLY when using this application and especially if the purchase is made with @SUPERSAVER. If you don't want to LOSE the money of your ticket and stay in an airport for more than 8 days without receiving ANY response from costumer service because it DOES NOT EXIST. neither via Email nor by phone is a false company. Be careful. Don't be naive I speak to you from my experience. I bought a Bogota Dubai ticket and they literally stole my money and nobody answered
2021,2,"It used to be great. But now, all it does is show me other sites to book on. Kayak was great when i booked through kayak. Now ive ended up using kayak more often to just book through other travel sites like kayak, so whats the point?"
2022,4,Good app for checking flights I would give it 5 Stars if not for that the expore opinion gives misleading prices on the map which do not match when you actually click on them. Otherwise this is a great easy to use app.
2021,1,"I booked 2 flights and got a confirmation email saying I will be getting my flight details shortly, but its almost been 24 hours since and still haven't received any. I've also been trying to invoice those flights but the code they sent me is not valid, it doesn't exist. I'm very scared I might have lost that money :("
2021,5,Very good app. Actually the best for booking flights and hotel. This I an saying after trying almost a student apps. Have been using it since long. Thought to rate it today. I strongly recommend it to all.
2019,5,"My #1 go to app for Flights and hotels. I usually compare car rentals with Costco Travel. Also don't forget some airlines are not listed in this app, like Southwest. So definitely compare rates there as well."
2020,1,"Broken website and app unless you provide your IP address to them or go through a captcha process from the evil company Google which works only once every 10 tries. I've moved over to just fly due to, too many issues with kayak. Hey kayak, ever hear of privacy?"
2022,3,Some rental car service providers are too bad. I'm referring here to Wisecars. I made a car rental through them two days prior to my contract starting date but my reservation was not shown in Avis system. Even the car I reserve is not available in Avis car group.
2019,5,"Wornderful support. app didn't work on my tablet for long, contacted the support who came back soon, investigated the issue and came back with recommendation that fixed the issue! Many thanks!"
2022,5,"Kayak has always been my go to to start searching for deals on flights, cars, and hotels. I've had the best experience with them over all the other discount search apps, and I've certainly never found any better deals in other places"
2022,1,"Watch out for sneaky extra baggage error. The app gives option to choose how much baggage you want to add to your booking and gives prices showing that extra baggage but when forwarded to make your purchase, you get charged the same fer but only 1 hold bag. This is misrepresentation."
2019,2,"the notices that have dropped on to my calendar are incorrect, showing that i have two checkins and two checkouts, like i booked two rooms? i also have a confirmation for an out of country booking, when i click on source email, it shows my trip to Tennesee. I am worried that someone has hacked my credit card or that I am going to be charged for something I did not purchase."
2022,3,"Easy to use, but flights prices are misleading. The price goes up significantly as soon as you click on it, of course, with a apology message. Disappointing."
2022,1,I had an issue with a car rental booking and I've trying to call kayak customer service since 11:30 am till 17:00 but no one is answering as the app and website doesn't have cancellation option. Worst after sale service ever.
2022,5,A wonderful application that gets you the results that you need when it comes to booking hotels card and flights they offer a wide variety of services but the most important thing you don't have to worry about going to all these sites individually kayak does it for you. Well done keep up the good work.
2022,5,"Kayak keeps all my travel plans in one place, whether or not I book thru the site. The app is easy to use and helps direct my searches. It is my go to when I want to plan any trip."
2020,1,"Having issues finding flights lately. I can check past searches and edit dates from there but I'm unable to search for flights. If I enter the airport name and click it, it'll dissappear.."
2020,4,Fix app. Not sure why car rental drop off time is automatically set to hour after pickup time. Always throws off rates. Have to manually set up time with every search.
2019,2,"Used kayak since it started. Applied new version and now loads very slow, and works very slow on my samsung galaxy tab s2 . Im not happy kayak. I may jump to different co."
2019,2,Yeah....nah! Used to be good but the latest update screwed the ability to search. Updated app 3 times in the space of 24hrs. Roll back the app until it's fixed please. Even the Feedback function is stuffed.
2023,5,My experience with kayak has been excellent. In the early days I received better deals and I do presently. So it's always wise to shop around. But kayak has consistently been reliable and uses companies that are reputable.
2019,4,great app for cheap trips. one issue. I was able to add a trip to the watchlist for the search result anywhere. not able to do this now. is this still possible?
2019,1,"Stupid difficult to use!!! Search hotel only option is near me after turning on location. Try search in the menu and takes me back to the same page of hotles near me. Search local the try and change location, not allowed. What is the point of having this app if i cant look up hotels for a getaway weekend? FIX IT"
2022,3,"Good but annoying, if searching for package holidays it asked for the same information twice and defaults back to the last search. Also the filers are too sensitive and will tick uf you scroll down."
2022,1,"Trash. Click bait pricing. They advertise a hotel price for their partners but when you click on their site, it's almost twice as expensive. What a scam"
2022,5,"Very easy to find what I need and best option to selecting in wide range.. Best part is the price alert, once you set up price alerts!!! 👍👍👍"
2018,2,I like the app but it works when it wants to work. Several times i have to redownload it because it stops working out of no where. Fix this issue so I can give it 5 stars
2022,1,"Good for comparing cities and deals but when you go to ""view deal"" the app just goes to a blank screen and doesn't actually take you anywhere."
2022,4,Could be a little better integrated for a flight/hotel trip or all three but otherwise no major issues. Slow to load but it is checking a lot of places. 🤷🏻‍♂️
2023,5,"Helpful in comparing pricing and flight durations, especially on European trips with multiple cities. I've booked flights through Kayak more than a dozen times since 2010 and never had an issue."
2022,3,Good platform but there are some scammer website is also linked . Like happyfares.in. they are running some scam . They will charge you the money and can't send you the ticket of your selected date . They can't give you the refund . Kayak such a better platform but because of such website it will get ruined
2018,1,"After using it for a week or so for searching for the same flight route, it now shows that route 3x more expensive than it really is at other apps like this. Absolutely 'poop' , shame..."
2020,1,Why are we forced to create an account and sign in after the update? I don't want to have remember another password just for searching for flights! I uninstalled this app and will be using different travel apps going forward.
2020,1,"LOVED this app for years... unfortunately recently I am not required to input my email address etc to get access to flight information. This is completely pointless and needs to be taken off, its inconvenient and annoying."
2019,5,"Simple to use, clean interface, checking multiple providers, relatively fast and up to date. Good work. Keep it up!"
2021,1,"Agoda, company based out of Bangkok Thailand that Kayak allows to book hotels on their on the app! If you select pad the hotel and pay cash you'll be charged on your card the minute you check in. I paid cash and never gave the hotel my card! My charges(cash/card) were the same amount! I'm currently fighting it cuz I was double-charged"
2022,1,The prices are a ploy to get you to click. Then you are taken to shady third party companies that are often send you on a rat race just to get the deal they advertised. The deal is then much higher and there is ZERO customer support. Never ever ever use the third party snap travel. They are a complete scam. Kayak should be ashamed for doing business with them.
2020,4,"Overall the app is quite good, but it has a few bugs: Can't change the check-out date of an existing hotel event. Can't delete a note once it has been added."
2019,5,Currently all has gone well. Everything has been smooth even though the purchases are separate. Allows for purchases to be organized into one app.
2019,4,"great app. though it needs more work with connection flights etc. with changing my destination to a nearby airport and taking another flight there, i savad hundreds of $, and time."
2021,1,It gives you a good deal then when you go to purchase the ticket the price raises hundreds of dollars. So many hidden cost. Would rather go somewhere more honest.
2019,1,"For giving Facebook detailed information without asking me for permission. The apps identified in this report, which include prayer apps, MyFitnessPal, DuoLingo, Kayak, Indeed, Shazam, Skyscanner, Spotify, Trip Advisor, and Yelp, send certain data to Facebook the second they are opened on a phone. The information includes the app's name and the user's unique ID with Google. This information is sent whether or not the user has a Facebook account. This is extremely unethical practice."
2020,1,"Does not work for Flights. Cannot input a departure city. To no avail, had already tried updating the app, so I have had to book four trips with alternate sites."
2021,3,"Doesn't mind too much about the filters I chose and please give the option to take away all ""hotels"" that's only available 2-4 hours a day. Is anyone honestly looking for a place to sleep some hours for 21 days in a row for example? For traveling in Asia it would also be nice with a definition of ""parking"" is it for cars or motorcycles / scooters?"
2020,1,"I'm getting rid of this app. Don't know what they did to it in the latest update, but it's terrible! Have used it for years with absolutely no problem until the past 2 months. I deleted my other review. DON'T USE THIS APP!"
2018,5,"Really great so far. I like the trip planning function and the ability to connect direct to all vendor sites, including Homeaway."
2020,1,"Good morning. Community International (Attention try to read this before you buy a packages of trip in this application) I'm Edwin Parra. Try don't to buy any travel packages with this application, Because they are the only agency, that you lose, everything. In case of any inconvenience, even you paying insurance. I lost $3,800 dollars. even I paying insurance. Because they have a return policy. That another travel agency, or application travel. Does not have it. pleases. open your eyes.."
2022,5,"Unlike other apps that give you insane 4 days travel routes, it makes sure it gives you the fastest way to arrive at your destination.The interface if the app is so smooth,with all additional flight info. I just love it 🔥🔥. I gotta say..um impressed"
2018,1,If you're going to send offers & promotions notifications then at least let me disable in-app. I shouldn't have to go into the OS settings to disable.
2023,2,"You show prices from the scam-services, like edreams etc that would always rise the price. I believe such services should be banned. Also you don't mention that prices are per person, which is super inconvenient. Why do you ask the number of passengers, if you don't show the total price?"
2023,5,"I've been using the Kayak app for years. It is my favorite of all the travel apps I have to use, and it makes it easy to book + consolidate reservations into a coherent trip."
2022,5,"Well I started to use this recently. I saw the packages and I love it. Super awsome. But I am struggling finding the umbrella symbol wich is for the packages. I was there when I went to kayak through Google. But when I signed into my account which I had since time ago but didn't use it, it wasn't that alternative until I found it and now its gone again. I left it there while I was in the kitchen and when I came back it wasn't there. Isn't in the menu. No anywhere."
2019,5,The ONLY app I use when booking flights. Simple app to use and the + or - feature is perfect if your schedule to fly is flexible.
2023,1,"The app is worthless in finding flights. It won't let me change airports and defaults to my ISPs web server's location. Lousy programming, for sure."
2023,5,Live Kayak!! Great tool for booking trips if you do your research
2021,3,I installed the app in hope to not readjust my filters with every search but it's the same as on the website so I don't see any advantages over the web version.
2023,5,"Great for exploring flight and accommodation options. I wish it could sort ""cheapest"" by default instead of ""best""."
2019,2,I usually book through kayak for the vacation packages including flight and hotel together. I'm not sure why that option is not available on the mobile app but I'll stick to the regular site.
2021,2,"Why does kayak show pricing from travelgenio when it's an untrustworthy site? Travelgenio uses bait and switch pricing to decieve travelers and has horrible online reviews. Unfortunately, I fell victim to being click happy and realized I overpaid after it was too late."
2023,5,Best flight search engine there ever was!
2020,4,"Great app, very efficient and clear but unfortunately they also post offers from scammer companies like FARESCAN. My flight was cancelled and, even though the airline was providing full refund, the Farescan company who sold the tickets demanded extra payments to provide a refund. DON'T USE FARESCAN!!"
2019,5,"Fantastic app for finding flights. Sometime there are other ways to get cheaper prices, but this is a good way to get a picture of the range of options."
2022,1,Account Error: Automatically Logged Out - This app used to be excellent but now gives me this error reading after a few minutes of usage. Still happening after I update the app.
2020,3,"You should be able to isolate your saved hotels on the map view in order to compare locations. Air BNB has this feature, it's a big let down for people who like to weigh their options."
2023,2,App every time changing my country and currency from France where I live to £ and GB. I have lots notification by email completely not relevant to this what I'm searching ( at least date is good🤣). So I'm sorry but only 2 stars.
2020,5,It's wonderful. And I would like to recommend you to build a trip total cost calculator. So we can manage trip budget easily.
2022,1,"Normally a really good app, used for years. Current version won't keep me logged in/errors on login all the time, making it impossible save flights"
2023,1,"Search feature doesn't work, never has, always returns an error. Won't waste your time with this app, try SkyScanner"
2023,1,"I don't understand why give me the option to fill out the seating, class, carry-on, & dates/time but still forces me to get redirected to an airline just to redo everything all over again!! Why deal with kayak in the first place"
2023,1,The prices are double than the other app im using and even is not added luggage nearly 300£ Will delete the app bcs have better options on other apps with luggage 🧳 and priority tickets 🎟 for 3 people on half price of this and including insurance!
2023,1,"I have updated the apps just now. However, when i try to find flights after the update, the apps keep unresponding. I'd try several times but still unresponding."
2018,5,Great app containing everything when looking for flights! Should add prices for when youths travel alone because right now you can only search for one adult prices.
2019,3,"Great App for finding round trip, multi-city flights as well as hotel stays. Flights times and prices not the same when redirected to booking site. Went directly to airline and got everything cheaper."
2019,5,"Great for researching, watching and buying flights! It's also awesome that it syncs emails from your inbox to create an entire itinerary for your trip"
2022,1,"Imagine, every flight is false advertised to be so much more expensive than what is shown. Imagine using an app that wastes users time. If you value your time like I do. Please don't download this or waste hours like I have. Google play shouldn't allow this fraud to continue. It's sick."
2020,3,"Good app overall, however it does not always show the lowest economy price. Google Flight has had lower economy flight prices for 3 of my booked trips over the past 10 months."
2021,5,I was able to get a hotel at the last moment and saved over $800 for the room for 6 days and 5 nights in Mobile Alabama. I would recommend kayak to anyone. I plan to use Kayak on future trips because of the ease of planning a trip through them.
2018,1,"you gave me wrong date for Birmingham to Dubai. the original dates and flight was for 27th Dec - Cork to Birmingham , 5 hour wait and then onto Dubai. you sent data saying flight from Birmingham to Dubai was 28th , which meant an overnight in Birmingham . this was in contradiction to original data. we ignored the 2nd set of dates and got to Dubai ."
2019,1,Kayaks flights have become a lot more expensive than other travel search engines. I've been using kayak about since it came out. No more.
2023,1,"Inaccurate Hotel Prices. If I search hotels in Las Vegas, filter to see total price, yet somehow it still gives me inaccurate prices. YOU GUYS USED TO BE GOOD. Are you guys now selecting partners that are SPAM? UNFORTUNATELY I WILL BE REMOVING APP."
2023,4,"Missing ""pets allowed in the cabin"" filter."
2020,1,"It won't let me sign in. When I try - no matter through Google, Facebook, Booking, anything - it says ""Something went wrong"". This used to be my favorite travel app. Please fix."
2023,5,easy to book flights
2021,5,Really easy platform to use Kayak! Never have had any issues with the app crashing or other technical difficulties. And of course great for finding travel deals!
2023,5,"Excellent, simple & user friendly 👍"
2021,2,"The ol' bait and switch. Rind something reasonable on the app, click and the price always increases. Easier to go through the airlines and hotels themselves."
2019,3,It used to have: how many days youd like to spend (like the website does) but this has been removed. Also would be easier if i can type the max price id like to spend on the trip. Change these and 5*
2020,5,All prices are affordable depending on your peference. It is a great app!! Has lots of options to choose from and it is the bomb!
2021,5,"I am from the Republic of Moldova, a country in vecinity of Romania. I registered for Kayak and everything seemed good, expecting the fact I couldn't set my region to Moldova and confirm my moldovan phone number, starting with +3. Please add this country to the application. Besides that, the overall experience is pretty good 🤠👍😊."
2022,2,"Because Kayak directs you to untrustworthy providers like Budgetair, I will no longer be using Kayak for my travel needs. If kayak sends you to budgetair, do NOT use them. They will scam you. Unfortunately Kayak would not help, so they either don't care, or support budgetair's shady practices."
2022,5,Great app for looking for cheapest prices on flights! Only wish there was a way to put flight you want on hold for a few days when you find one.
2022,4,"Previous syncing issues fixed. Occasional glitches and I wish that Southwest Airlines was an included search, but overall very beneficial."
2022,3,"Frustrating app. For example, I can see non stop flights if searched on their own but not in multiple city requests. Too frustrating for words."
2023,5,kayak has been my go-to app for booking flights and hotels for years
2022,4,ChatDeal must go. My experience with ChatDeal has turned me off from ever wanting to use a booking site like this again. From now on I will book directly with the airline. Prior to this I had no issues with Kayak.
2023,5,Very helpful app especially do e air travel. The only thing is Southwest isn't included for flights so be sure to check their prices separately.
2020,4,This is a great app to make sure I get the best deal. I usually hotwire hotels then compare prices with kayak. You can see so many at once
2022,1,The way you select the dates is absolutely annoying. I am unistalling this app. I'm trying to plan a trip and this app isn't working with flights. I'm done with Kayak.
2023,5,"Easy to use, very responsive"
2023,5,very good to search flight
2023,5,Highly recommended app for comparing rates for hotel flights works exceptionally well. I have never really faced any issues with this app.
2021,1,"They went downhill in the last few years. I searched for s hotel WITH taxes and fees, they sent me to a third party that clearly displayed the room fee and taxes. ONLY AFTER i put in my chair l credit card and they charged it, they displayed a message that the hotel will be charging me YET ANOTHER FEE. Gotta find a new travel app."
2019,5,"Absolutely Essential travel app, and I don't usually leave ratings or comments but it was necessary for this app. Gotta give credit where credit is due."
2021,1,Absolutely dreadful user interface that keeps resetting the set preferences. Prices also not as good as the competition. Just don't use Kayak
2020,5,Excellent place to not only get reservations of all sorts but to also possibly save more money by adjusting your schedule by plugging in different dates and times.
2019,1,"Hotels are booked through a third party called agoda. They literally wanted me to scan the front and back of my credit card and submit it to them. Absolutely not. See you later, kayak."
2022,1,KAYAK IS A SCAM. DO NOT INSTALL. Paid 1200 euro for a flight from Amsterdam to tlv (2 tickets) payment went through edreams and I never got confirmation email even though I paid for this option (yes you have to pay for it) called edreams and they explained to me that kayak published flights that doesn't exist. Thx to a kind guy that works in edreams I got my money back. DO NOT BOOK WITH KAYAK. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY.
2023,1,"Don't ever buy a ""Kayak"" branded trip."
2021,4,"The app will cover the basics of travel (flight, room, car). Things like tours, trains, etc are better handled on the website."
2023,4,I appreciate the honesty in the app.
2023,5,Easy to Use!
2019,4,"mostly a great app, BUT you need to kick Snap Travel off your platform. They're garbage! They charge you immediately, but don't tell you it could take HOURS to actually check in to your room. If you have any issues, they have a No Refunds policy, so you're basically screwed."
2023,5,"The only app I use to check my flights and the only one I need! It works, saves time, and you get the best offers!"
2023,5,always so accurate
2019,5,Very good App for flight searching and booking. It is very useful to plan business trip. I would recommend to my friends and colleagues.
2023,5,Very convenient tool to have on your phone. Helps you to have a peek into flight prices. Been using it for years. No complaint.
2019,4,"I like kayak, but the explore tool doesn't work. it displays a price and when you click to get flight info it always shows a higher price."
2021,2,"It's hard to pick which airlines you want, for example, I don't flying to a certain country cause last two times I've lost luggage etc."
2020,1,"Used KAYAK for years and has always been my go to comparison app. Unfortunately it now requires you to sign in, why? This means I've now switched to alternate apps. Flight searches from 'London all airports' returns only Gatwick!"
2019,4,"It is a very good tool. But it presents offers from only limited airlines per time, limiting options. But a very useful tool."
2019,5,Love this app. been using for a few years and never had any issues. I like that I can see all airlines in one place. Every now and then find amazing flight deals
2019,3,"kayak, I like the cheap flights you have offered, please stop using Vayama as one of your cheap scanned flight. they have scammed a lot of people and I have yet to receive my refund. i'm already thinking of legal avenues just to get their sorry as* to do the right thing."
2020,1,As good as it was. Searching flights is a chore. With update it has been made up into most user unfriendly. Time to look for a replacement search app.
2022,5,"User friendly, safe, easy to navigate, overall its just a really solid app to use, it will always get the job done for me."
2021,5,"That Middle Eastern Commercial Lady I saw on the Ad in YouTube, Whoa She is Hot And sexy and motivated me to download this app. I wish I can have her name and Instagram and then marry her. I haven't used the app just wanted to leave feedback about the Ad. Sexy Stuff"
2023,1,I've never met anyone who has used split flights... Ever! Yet there is no way to have direct flights as default for my searches. Poor design.
2021,5,Does what I usually do on my own but sooo mich faster. With all the filter options it's super easy and fast to find the deal that fits my budget.
2022,1,One of the resllers forced my airline to process a refund i did not want so that they could keep $600 of my ticket price. Kayak wont help resolve the issue. I would recommend that everyone AVOID USING THIS APP bc they work as a referal service for scammers that they dont vet properly.
2020,5,My experience with Kayak is always flawless. This is my go-to site for booking flights and reserving rental cars and never encountered any problems.
2019,5,"By far the best travel app. I've used it religiously for several years, and each time I try something else, I always cone back to KAYAK. Job well done & they keep improving."
2020,5,"Great I find only the best rates for hotels in and around Lafayette, la I have to travel for work I'm in the home health care system and I'm constantly looking for great deals on hotels in Lafayette, la for work so I use this app a lot and always quite satisfied"
2022,2,I've seen several times that the search displays hotels prices that are not real. When you click the site of your partner the price doesn't exist and that's is making me waste a lot of time.
2020,4,"It doesn't always show the lowest fare, but it does show current flights and has a great interface."
2021,5,"This app is phenomenal, I've never seen an app that helps me keep track of all of my reservations like this one does. Truly usual, not just for finding the best deals, but also great at that too!"
2022,5,"This site aggregator does a great job of letting you compare prices and deal specifics. There's also some great ""mobile only"" discounts that pop up that can really save you money."
2019,5,Easy to use and find the exact type of flight you want! Great prices as well! Love the convenience of the app and the flight alerts!
2020,4,When searching flights I really need to see the date. Right now it shows 'Nov 7' to 'Nov 1' instead of 'Nov 17'. I prefer viewing this on the computer because this is time consuming to click in to check the date if I want flex dates...
2018,5,"Convenient and reliable! I love how all of my trips, no matter how i booked them automatically show up in the Kayak app."
2022,1,"Okay so I don't know if it was just a bug or if that's actually what you're trying to charge people but the ticket prices on there are absolutely insane, it literally said $14,000+ I'm just at a loss for words after that"
2021,2,"Usually great but with the latest update trying to book a business flight now grabs a premium economy flight and you need to really be aware that it's not business, even when you specifically choose business cabin Be very aware of this Kayak, please sort this out, it's actually false advertising"
2023,4,"It helps a lot when trying to compare prices. Sometimes it is tricky the information regarding the baggage policies, but overall it has helped a lot."
2021,5,Great deals and medium-level instructions. If you're very familiar with how apps work it will be easy to schedule a variety of flights at a low price.
2019,5,"Amazing app best app to check real fast alot of prices. But there is a new airport in isreal Eilat called ramon, i would like to see it in the future because its international. Its a new airport, but it allready got 2 flight international so... please update it"
2023,4,"While not the prettiest or slickest app out there, it's efficient, and the color coded/shaded airfare calendars are helpful tool when planning a trip."
2018,5,Awesome and reliable site. I can always trust Kayak to deliver the best possible prices from flights to car rentals. Love Kayak! It's the only site I use when I need last minute flight plans.
2021,5,"My go to travel app. I like how you can get flights, cars and accommodation in the same place, I also like how it stores your trips for you. And it always finds me good deals."
2020,1,Slow and confusing as it redirects to sites that ask you all the same questions and make you re-choose your hotel. Also.. the prices change significantly when you click.
2019,1,"it was very great when airlines used to diaplayed their real fare, and not clickbaits to sell expesive tickets, it was useful when able to buy round trips with one transaction not multiple.."
2023,5,I like the way it finds cheapest flight hotels and car rental. I was at the airport and one rental was $1600. On the spot I went on kayak app and with the same rental company it was $700+ only 🙃
2019,5,"After lots of updates, I can finally stop using the mobile website since the features are the same now. The filters are really useful."
2019,1,"Good but TOTALLY USELESS APP. I cannot read your outliney/hollow font. the 3's, 5's and 6's all look the same on my phone. Duh!"
2021,1,"FYI KAYAK is promotin a site to book your flight called SmartFares. I found them through KAYAK and booked a flight, when I called the airline to confirm that all was in order, the airline customer service told me there was nothing book with reservation # or my name. I called many times SmartFares and they kept disconecting the call. I ended up calling my credit card to cancel the transsaction with SmartFares. Becareful!"
2019,5,"Great app, use it 6-7 times a year for domestic and international flights. Great experience, efficient and user friendly."
2019,5,Only start using it last month. It is a must for traveller and absolutely a game changer. 5 star are indeed wll deserved and a well done to the developers. Highly recommended 🔝
2020,4,"Really nice pricing and sometimes is the unique platforms where you can easily make a Ryanair flight with decent transit (otherwise you should make it manually, which take hours, and probably you will made a mistake like 17 hours at the airport waiting your next flight)"
2019,4,"I have been exploring this app fo 2 days now, so I am still getting acquainted with it. I shall return with a better review later. But so far so good. I like having options from all types of booking sites. ~TOODLES~"
2022,5,"Of all of the third-party travel apps out there, Kayak seems to me to be the most straightforward and leads to the best deals."
2022,3,"Seeing actual prices in the date selector similar to Google Flights on a mobile browser, rather than just some color coding, would be a huge improvement."
2021,5,"pretty awesome! in fact i did not expect it to be that detailed, and yet simple to use, and quite accurate; i was thinking for a while about joining Kayak and i wasn't doing it but hey it's definitely worth it!"
2021,1,Do not. I reapet DO NOT use (travelgenio)!!! on this app. They are a scam and will rip you off. Now with this whole covid thing going on these companies are finding ways to get over and not pay your money back. Cancing trips and not answering the phone.
2021,5,"Love this app. Always finds me the best prices, and some unique places to stay every time. Book all my trips to Europe with them. Will use them again and again. 👍"
2022,2,A great app - but you need to be careful - Kayak offers great prices with companies without a customer service. There's no option to cancel or complaint.
2020,3,"All good, but when selecting one day rental, it sets automatically +1 hour for the return time (intentionally or not), which increases the cost if unnoticed."
2019,5,I have used this app in the US and other countries and it's good for booking a planned vacation. But it's also been a life saver when you can't find a hotel somewhere.
2019,1,"takes forever to load, then search for airports does not show any results. seems that connectivity to the server is dead slow."
2019,5,Out of all the travel apps Kayak definitely sits at my top favourite . The search engine is awesome and it genuinely seems to strike better prices than it's competitors
2022,5,"Excellent! Love that it shows the prices. Great time saver. Just one thing, why are my emails showing prices in £ not $? How do I fix it?"
2020,3,Keeps on crashing on Android. When tracking flight date default to previous day. Most times apps crush. No search results
2018,2,"Looks good but you are drawn in by cheap hotel prices which change as soon as you open the link, rarely are they the same as what you see when you search"
2019,5,"I've used this app for almost 10 years...love it! I haven't traveled much since hubby retired from the military, but I use it to plan our vacations. It keeps getting better and better!"
2022,5,"Personally I've found that out of all the apps of it's type, such as hopper or Expedia it always finds the best deals and is very quick"
2020,5,With you I have no problem it's with the Airlines airports border controls etc I have a problem you would think in this day and age you could pass through airports airside without needing to go into quarantine if you use the same airline but to get a straight answer everyone refers you to someone else so I find your or app very straightforward yours Brent Watts
2019,5,"Look no further, this app is reliable in comparison to other search engines. Gives me the options comparing different sites and getting the best deals."
2023,5,I'm happy with kayak app. So far so good. 5 star for sure. Organized perfectly. Explore all app in period of 24hour and learned how to use it. Just amazing.
2019,1,"DO NOT BUY TICKETS THROUGH KAYAK! I lost $6000 worth of tickets over three days in April 2018 even though some were bought over a month in advance and cancelled in less than 24 hours after buying the tickets. Even with cancellation insurance, I only received a refund of $125. Apparently unknown companies sell cancellation insurance on Kayak because when I tried to file a claim, Kayak said they had no idea who was selling the insurance? Use the site to find the route but buy the tickets yourself."
2019,1,some of kayak partners have some bad cancellation policies some good some really bad. i wouldn't recommend this app at all. i think now that's how this app makes it's money. screw people over if they find a better deal.
2023,1,"What happened? Used the Kayak app all the time....now it's unusable. It keeps getting stuck, can't look up anything. Will be un-installing if this continues."
2020,1,This version of kayak app sucks the last version was way better I've never had so many problems I've used kayak for years very disappointed please fix your app
2019,5,1 of the best travel booking sites i have ever experienced. i always book everything related to travel from this site. highly recommended.
2021,3,"It was good so far. But new updated version loses the option to book with Kayak. Please keep the option "" Book with Kayak"" in every flight info. Do not redirect to any websites"
2019,5,I have used it for over 7 years and find it a great app. I like the notifications re flights gates time change etc.
2022,5,The best ticketing app I've used which includes many platforms. I like the+-3 days for finding the best deal if you're flexible with timing!
2022,1,Called customer service to cancel a flight and they keep hanging up on me 5X they don't address you with thank you or anything really bad cust serv from over seas by the sound of the voice. Will never use this app even if I have to pay more
2023,5,Really like feature of it showing adjustable dates with pricing.. New to this & seems very easy to understand ... THANK YOU!!
2022,4,"Lately I've been having a lot of issues with failed refreshes. I've rebooted, un/re-installed...no change."
2018,5,I use the Kayak often while out of the country on business for last minute hotel and flight arrangements. Always lots of options and great prices.
2018,5,Haven't actually booked a flight yet but quickly searches through all the travel websites. Easy one stop site for your travel needs.
2018,5,"Ads are a pain and if there was another I'd delete it. Ads that's supportive, contributory, fine. Disruptive, no. And you even ask if they are disruptive! You know they are."
2023,5,"I've relied on good prices from kayak for years, before even the app existed. The app makes the searching experience even easier. Thanks Kayak."
2019,4,"Automatically sharing trip details with a given email address isn't working. i have to manually forward... couldn't find help out support in the app, so posting here"
2022,3,"Kayak is ok, but I wish you could see rooms, sizes, descriptions, etc... I end up leaving the app to search the hotel's website, which is probably not what kayak would want..."
2023,2,"Why no hotel + flight on the app? And anytime I try to do something on the website, it loads this app and erases all my progress. Had to uninstall to actually book my trip."
2019,1,"where is ""trips"" section? its gone in both app and web! ::[[[ do you restrict some users from the full functions? upd for dev: it's NOT in the menu - do u think i'm blind?? mentioned support page immediately hides feedback form if Trips topic is selected"
2020,5,"Works great, saves me money, great UI/UX. Expedia is also awesome tough and has found me deals that kayak doesn't show."
2021,1,"Broken. Booked wrong days twice by auto changing fields. Wasted a lot of $$ on two wrong, non refundable bookings. Impossible to get ahold of customer service."
2019,5,"I can find the best prices very quick with just standing home and enjoying my coffee.I have booked many times my flights through this app and I didn't have a problem at all, I definitely recomend it👍"
2021,5,Very good to navigate the entry States snnd flight options. It is timely and up to date.
2023,5,"All in one place, whenever I need an app or site that can give the best value for flights my go to is Kayak. I specially love the world map where you can see cheap flights all around the world"
2018,5,"I have only ever used Kayak for flights but I will look into the other offers they give. It is cheap, they compare prices, great app, love it."
2023,1,Prices shown are higher than if you go to/through the hotels directly or the other travel apps that they are comparing.
2022,3,"Trip planning could be easier. Such as all inclusive deals, total price of the trip and itenerary."
2018,2,Only useful for the trips feature. The actual search features are lacking compared with momondo and skyscanner
2020,1,"As others have said, android legacy systems cannot use this app. Running android 7 here, and getting no results. Uninstalling and switching elsewhere"
2021,1,Very bad customer service. No one to answer phone calls or emails. Horrible traveling experience.
2023,5,I always use kayak to find the best flight options. And the trip function is really handy.
2022,5,Hi. I am unable to search for flights since yesterday and the app said that I should give you feedback if it continues. Something needs to be done. Thanks.
2020,1,"It was a decent app before they forced people to create an account or sign in. Very foolish, I'm done with Kayak. There are plenty of other apps which don't force me to share my personal info."
2023,5,The interface is very user-friendly; I often prefer it to google for rapid travel information due to ease of use.
2022,5,"Always use kayak when looking for airline tickets, especially for international flights. I use it for reference."
2019,1,Been trying to book a flight for 5 days and still not pushing through. I called my bank and it seems that your site has the problem not my card. This is so upsetting!
2023,5,I switched to Kayak for the trips feature which Google inexplicably decided to get rid of and it's great! See ya Google Travel.
2018,4,I'm having issues communicating back to you thru the kayak app. When I try to rate from the email - How was your trip with Southwest to San Diego? None of the links work.
2023,5,Great way to get the best price! Compare all airline prices or car rentals. Easy to use modify your search ect...
2018,4,"Its missing package option. Flight+hotel and also if that is added then the feature of ""I only need hotel for a part of my trip"" must be added."
2020,4,I use all the booking apps. Lately kayak is the first to be opened in searchs for options on budget friendly prices
2019,4,"Wonderful app Looking forward to the time when all the airlines, including the discounted ones, show up in my searches."
2019,5,I like the explorer feature where you can check prices around the world and monitor different trip ideas in planning with a plus or minus 1 to 3 day feature.
2019,5,"I travel frequently and have been using Kayak for many years now. It's the only one I use, always gives me the best deals, flights & prices."
2023,5,This is the best air travel application that I've ever used. It hasn't disappointed me even when purchasing tickets through it. Well done and keep it up!
2020,5,"Best flight finder, hands down. This app will look for routes that no other app or site can and will open up possibilities that you haven't even thought of."
2019,5,"Love the ease of use and simplicity of the app! In one go, i can see the best prices of hotels and flights with taxes."
2020,5,"I've been using kayak since before the invention of the horse. I love this engine. The app is a very functional, effective tool that helps you get right to the point."
2020,2,Be careful when using this app. They take NO responsibility for the BS companies they allow to list on here. Like Fox Rental Cars. Zero human interaction in the event of an issue. Trip Advisor much better customer service.
2018,2,"Was loving the app but all of a sudden, I cannot connect to the app via WiFi or data. Very frustrating"
2019,1,"they probably track how many time you look for a flight and raise the price, if you go incognito on your browser and look for the same price you might be surprise.."
2019,4,We have used this app for flights almost 7 years now. It is fairly comprehensive and easier to use than other booking apps.
2019,1,If the language on your device isn't set to English (e.g. Russian) then the section Trips disappears. It happened recently after previous update
2019,3,It's ok would give higher score if listed packages from Canada in Canadian prices. All email packages I receive are from JFK departures in US $ totally useless to us. Will uninstall and block their emails or unsubscribe.
2020,2,"I Just Uninstalled it. Why do you force people to sign in? It was a good app before the latest update, there are plenty of apps which don't require all that bureaucracy to check flight prices."
2022,1,I should be on the flight 29 August from Cayman islands transit thru Tampa to England and never knew that I should have a transit Visa any how is when I reach to the airport I knew that I should have it I receive it call the company asking for a different date to travel they didnot from I have been traveling I never knew that a person can't change date offer purchasing a ticket people be careful with this App Kayak a thief them you a lone leave on the wayside .
2021,1,"DO NOT BUY flight tickets, KAYAK is NOT returning the money of flights that were canceled by airlines even when I purchased straight with KAYAK. They told me to call the airline and I told them why? I booked thru you. I moved to Expedia they assist you way better. Do yourself a favor don't make the same mistake I did."
2022,5,Kayak rocks. It is my go to for trip planning. The Flex Dates feature is fantastic for finding the most affordable flights across many days fast.
2023,1,"Won't be using Kayak again. The company they use Travelers help desk was suppose to accept our tickets from American Airlines but they didn't. So when we went to get our itinerary we found out our ticket was suspended. After talking with American Airlines they were able to reactivate the tickets but it was an additional 600 dollars, update, U am currently working with Kayak customer service, they have contacted Travelers help desk and they will contact me, So just waiting to hear from them."
2023,5,Great place to start planning your travels. UI is amazing and it integrates well
2023,5,Great deals on international flights. You can even get good carriers for cheap if you choose the self-transfer option
2020,4,"Love the filters you can apply, and that you can sort by best days to travel (instead of guessing when it will be cheapest)"
2019,5,I like the trip itinerary planning feature. Keeps track of all my conformations in one location.
2018,2,"They don't give you right prices and their support is terrible. Instead of being greatfully for your time explaining their error, they keep saying the same execuses. Don't buy tickets using their plataform, is not trustful and the support won't treat you well."
2023,5,Always good place to find good reasonably priced flights. Easy to use interface too.
2019,5,I love Kayak because it's easy to use and to find deals without all the crazy extra windows and blinking stuff like other apps.
2021,5,Explore feature in this app is really a great one feature for budget traveling & helps exploring the new routes worldwide within pocket friendly budgets
2022,1,"I ordered my flight. Money was taken out but I received no email with the flight. Now I can't contact anyone to figure out the time, date or flight carrier. This is ridiculous. Atleast you should show what flight I purchased. Who am i suppose to contact to get help?"
2022,1,Not as advertised. Downloaded specifically for the bag measuring tool and there is no option for it anywhere on the app.
2022,5,Excellent travel price search up. Intuitive controls and display.
2021,1,"New update is horrible. Constantly applies filters. When I close them, it puts them right back in."
2022,5,I always use Kayak to get great prices and multiple choices. Filters are handy to get what you want.
2019,5,Excellent selectability and ease of use. Options are easy to investigate and price.
2020,5,"For years this became the tool i am uaing exclusively for travel planning. Easy, flexible, reliable."
2019,5,everything u need to find in one app bought flight with ease always the best prices no false advertising it very simple and fast to use it takes you directly to the proper airlines or hotel love it
2019,5,"Awesome app for flights, hotels and cars. Gives me best deal comparison for all three. Really useful."
2021,3,"Laat time price alert now the traveler option can change i choose 2 traveler adult 1 youth and 1 child. But the option not change still 1 traveler..so i can find the price, annoyed."
2019,1,"Kayak has lately been offering bookings from a fraudulent outfit called Agoda. I booked a $72 one night stay at a condo and 10 mins later was notified by my bank that they had blocked a fraud attempt by some LLC in Hong Kong with a different name to hit my card for $272. When I notified Kayak of this, they blew it off and asked Agoda to contact me directly like I didn't get mints on my pillow or something. This isn't bad customer service...this is actively supporting fraud for profit."
2019,5,"I feel like there are many more options, abundant info on places, better deals when planning a trip"
2020,3,"I just deleted the app after being a faithful user for many years, due to the new obligation to register a profile. I'll keep using the web service as long as logging in isn't required."
2021,1,"Worst customer service. Don't book your flights through Kayak, book directly through airline. My flights were canceled. Called kayak customer service multiple times, put on hold for hours, and transferred from one department to other - customer support, schedule change, refund departments, with no solution. Called airline and they said refund can processed if the booking agent kayak files RA number. But kayak does not provide the RA number. Kayak Customer service is rude and has no empathy."
2021,1,Dodgy agencies! Sent me to edreams which ripped me off and pretended to sell me a flight! I also had an issue with a flight i booked through a different agency years ago where i was stopped at the airport and they wouldn't let me fly.
2020,1,These are scumbags taking advantage of people while in a state of emergency in the United States do not trust these people do not use this app they send you to other sites that are just scammed to get your money and hold your money to 15 to 30 days so they can make interest off it and then get it back to give it back to you after they made their interest and inconvenience in you
2018,4,"Overall good app, but prices in the explore mode significantly different from the ones via web interface"
2019,2,think it might be a glitch but you can't search the destination ypu want to go to with out it saying no results found. ie man to Lisbon or man to Tokyo
2021,1,"Do not book from Kayak or its partner Priceline. I booked a car from Kayak and canceled after a few hours. Despite their return policy, they did not refund in full ($50 missed). Nobody responded me until now!"
2020,5,I am using this app fir years and no other app is as good as this. You get best prices. But tgete is one downside that it uses cookies to prevent giving cheaper prices next time.
2022,1,Not able to change the cost to total cost in the settings. I am alway seeing single flight fees.
2023,1,"Made a flight and then it appears it did not work. Disappointed right now, time will tell but poor start out of the gate. Very poor."
2022,2,Most of the hotels in search results are unavailable on the dates specified. UX is good but on the whole it's a waste of my time.
2023,3,"Was fantastic till I connected it to my google account. Now it is too busy trying to ""help"" and keeps getting stuck doing even the basic things"
2019,5,Best app for searching travel i have ever utilized. app actually works better than the online version if you ask me and easier and simpler to use.
2022,1,"Waste of time, prices never match with the linked sitee or the flights don't exist, even to the point where spent the time putting in all the details and credit card information then it fails to process the payment as flights do not exist"
2022,3,Great app but lags on the plane tickets. United airlines never works ever . Used to not be like that but lately it's horrible
2021,3,Doesn't work at all.. i write the city name and it disappears one i press the V button. Update : Seems to be working now after the phone updated to andriod 11
2018,4,Easy to use. Well laid out. Reasonably intuitive. I'd recommend it for anyone who travels.
2019,5,"I use this app to plan every trip, I highly recommend this company. very fair prices and never had any issues."
2022,2,"There is no option to put all airports in the country, you always have to select the particular one. Uninstalling."
2022,5,It great but it would be better if it can let me know prices in surrounding airports to find the cheapest airport too.
2019,1,"You took my favorite feature away: Watchlist. It is useful and without it, this app makes no sense for me. If it's not back I'm gonna uninstall it."
2021,1,I am very disappointed to this application! This is a 💯legit scam until now still its not paid my booking and i didn't find may eticket and the oman air asking for settle this payment 1st but my credit card is is already lessen worth of $977😭😭😭😭😭
2019,5,Simple. Full of tracking options. Love the anywhere anytime part to see where is cheaper from my origin airports
2021,1,Filter does not function. Filter out an airport... but it still shows up on the list.
2023,4,A good app to find which airlines are flying where at what time and the cost. I'm going to use it more for booking hotels and keeping travel info in one place.
2022,5,"Kayak is great one stop shopping for trip planning. It is also a wonerful trip organizer with notifications of flight changes, checkin times andgate changes at airports which unfortunately has become a routine travel eaperience in the USA."
2019,5,"Absolutely a must for traveling. Easy and convenient to use, keeps you informed with fluctuating air fares and flight changes."
2019,1,"Firstq1 of all, this app can barely find any flights, secondly, this is to complicated, ALSO THE ADS ARE CLEARLY NOTHING LIKE THE REAL THING!"
2018,5,"Great deals, great UI for easily browsing around and easy comparing different websites!"
2018,3,The app is actually easy to use when it works. Sometimes on my Android phone the app refuses to accept flight dates and crashes.
2020,5,"Great App. Very fast, easy to use, and unlike Skyscanner, the flights shown are actually available"
2023,5,"Good app! Very fast, informative and full of filters to personalise the search."
2023,5,Kayak knows better than most airlines when you're departure or arrival will be early or delayed. Perfect for airport pickups and drop offs.
2020,1,Force Signup to window shop for hotels... This used to be great...now its a typical marketing wasteland. Uninstall! There are plenty others to use.
2020,1,"Contrary to online price choices do not allow to filter booking site by airlines only, airlines are more responsible then resellers in my experience. Also selecting business class for some reason economy seats appear, what is the point?"
2019,4,Wish I could save potential trips as I am searching for vacation options. Honestly I just been using the app for 2 days... Not sure if that's actually a function.
2020,5,One of the better apps I have installed and worked with. Very quick and to-the-point. I am yet to book a flight on it and will report as soon as it is done.
2020,5,"I like this app however I found that it tends to find the better deals for western countries, but not always the lowest deals for countries in the east."
2023,1,"The worse service. No one picked up calls when you need, dont buy tickets on this app. I will buy in flight agency."
2023,5,"Very nice app, extremely low prices for flight. I recommend this app to y'all if you are a cheap person😁, very nice app"
2018,1,"According to the Finincial Times, the androod version of this is one of 20 or so popular apps that shares user data with Facebook - without asking user permission. I am uninstalling."
2020,5,Straight forward display of information. Easy to understand and modify your searches.
2022,5,"I love kayak. I ways find a great deal on flights, car rentals and vacations. My family can't believe the prices and deals I find. Owe it all to kayak."
2019,5,"Great, user friendly and easy to use. Especially the multi city option."
2021,5,Got all the options I wanted except attractions which I needed since I am traveling with my kids for fun. Great app guys though . I will recommend to friends thoug
2022,1,I have been trying for days now to book a flight from Johannesburg to Durban and I keep getting an error that says couldn't be processed. I give it time and go again still same issue. Please help.
2023,3,No widgets support. I love Kayak Trips to access my flights and hotels at a glance but the lack of widgets prevent me from switching from Trip it.
2019,5,It really works.Prevents you from all the hassle of finding cheap air tickets. It does the job perfectly.
2018,1,"Doesn't seem to work in China. Shows no flights from both WUX or PVG on any given date, using VPN or not doesn't make a difference."
2019,1,When clicking $29 flights nothing happens. Looks like Travelgenio abusing your platform and I do not see normal flights because of it. All flights comes from Travelgenio.
2018,5,"Works perfectly especially when you're about to take a quick vacation that doesn't require much planning, Kayak does that for you!"
2021,4,"Quick and manageable site, easy to maneuver...and love the forecasting advice...You should have better tie ups with airlines so you can offer better rates than other provider."
2020,1,Most confusing app I've ever used. I was trying to book a flight from Dallas to Orlando and the best result it gave me was Dallas to Dallas for $111.00
2023,1,"Can't make any searches, doesn't work!"
2019,1,"Hotel price alert emails are useless. Eg last email said ""hotels down by 77% "".. hotel name not mentioned in the email..click on links, again doesn't identify the cheap hotel. Waste of time"
2019,5,super easy to find anything your looking for and always ends up being the best price!
2019,4,"A really good app, I wish I could be able to see the prices of flights by looking at the calendar."
2018,4,"While a good and handy travel app, more and better user data management is needed. Reduce the number of clicks when deletion is required."
2022,4,The kayak website usually shows dates in green that have deals but why does the app not show the highlighted dates that have good deals. It would help in searched
2021,5,My favorite engine for search flights. Please don't change never and continue like this!!! Best app ever for flights search.
2019,4,"pretty easy to use, some of the prices shown don't seem accurate when you try to book"
2022,3,"Add a tab for saved flights, if I want to compare saved flights i have to look at each search individually"
2023,2,"Very bad No feedback allowed Always changed dates Current position can't be found Once transferred data to another app, dates are changed."
2023,5,efficient and easy to use
2023,1,"This app was good, now you can book a room that's not there and good luck on a refund, that's the world according kayak and super travel these days I can see how they make money 👎👎"
2019,5,best app gives best price for booking and same price given at a time no change at merchant site very nice and easy app but have to make account individually for all airline
2022,5,"Easy app, really works well and isn't false information. Always gets me the flights and the car hire it's found me"
2019,5,"Wonderful app, I love the layout, intuitive design and exceptional accomidations filters!!"
2023,4,"Love the Kayak app, both for searching for flights but also keeping your trip information organised in one place by forwarding your receipts to Kayak."
2021,4,"Very useful when comparing prices but there's room for improvement for other features like deals, airline ratings etc."
2019,4,airlines use kayak and others to plug holes for cheap flights. so dont look to often . i always use kayak first anyway .
2021,2,"Prices not stable unlike before, difficult to navigate the UI, which was basically the reason Kayak was so good previously."
2020,4,Nice update. Please remove the white bar at the bottom of the screen for full screen gestures.
2020,4,I t has nice filter and sort features. The only missing thing is to be able to. combine trips
2021,5,Great filters and I really enjoy seeing the prices from so many different sites all at once.
2019,4,"Great tool, would be better if it saved +/- day and bag options to saved searches."
2021,5,"I had issue with just fly through kayak, but the immediate respond from Kayak and just fly . Issue fixed. Thank you kayak, thank you just fly."
2019,4,Easy to use and i used to use Skyscanner but now i find the interface of this much easier to use and the numbers appear larger
2020,5,"Great way to find the best deals for traveling. Book everything in one place....air fare, hotels and rental cars."
2023,5,"Easy to get pricing for trips from flights, hotels, and car rentals. Let's you know the best deals too."
2021,5,Love kayak! Always comes through in a Last minute pinch. Plus the features on the app work really well.. Thanks a lot guys!
2019,5,"Easy to use, affordable price and the most important is kayak have option for checking luggage which is important where many air flights not include it nowadays"
2020,5,Great app features such as choosing variable date ranges and organizing the desired flight+housing into itinerary form.
2018,5,Great app for finding and buying flights. Even has how many bags you can check on your international flights.
2023,2,Was not able to connect through Google 3rd party
2023,5,great travel search tool
2023,5,best for checking all the airlines
2023,5,Best airline tickets. I always use Kayak!!
2020,1,This app never let's me select package deals... I can only choose Flights or hotels I can never bundle on the app that sucks.....
2023,2,Linked site doesn't offer same price searched
2022,5,Excellent app for searching lowest airfares. I checked a fare in domestic flight in India in GOIBIBO and Makemytrip. It showed lowest fare as 6900 INR. Even on airlines website lowest fare was 6900 INR.But strangely KAYAK guided me to websites where ultimately I bought tickets at 3500INR. Would recommend this app to fellow travellers for searching lowest airfares
2023,3,Better quotes of price would be appreciated
2019,5,simple easy and all in one place. i love the digital boarding passes too.
2020,4,Good app but have some issues after latest update!!! In dark mode hours are not visible in rent a car option. Please update!
2021,5,My go to traval app.i like how you can get flights cars and accommodation in the same place.l also like how it stores your trips for you..
2022,3,I am disappointed this app will not let you choose a handicap room. Would like to see this change making easier to use when booking hotels.
2021,1,Looks like this app steers you to the highest rates they can find. $450/night for a motel. Anyone paying that is an idiot. Uninstalled as quickly as I installed it.
2022,5,My go to app anytime I'm booking a trip. Very easy to use with plenty of options.
2023,5,I always use Kayak to plan my trips. Excellent reference for when prices are estimated be the best.
2019,5,I love this app my husband and i work for the airlines so we just have to get hotels and we got the best rate in NYC for a week vacation could not be more happy with this app
2019,1,"Its very bad experience they does not booked tickets and cuts my credit card payment if we connect kayak they saidThanks for reaching out to KAYAK. A quick reminder, KAYAK lets you easily compare hundreds of travel sites at once. Once you find the booking option you like, KAYAK gives you choices where to book. You can book with an airline, hotel, car rental company, an online travel agency or via KAYAK through one of our third-party providers. We do not have record of any recent reservations"
2020,5,Gives accurate and a wide range of services. Extremely helpful and useful app.
2022,5,At this point I have only used Kayak for rental vehicles. This app always gives me the cheapest price for the vehicle I'm needing.
2023,1,the check in with baggage makes a huge difference
2020,5,"A must-have app if one does any traveling, even if it's just one night of the a year. I always find the best rates on Kayak."
2019,5,"love all the filters, makes shopping easier, love the ""anywhere"" flight destination.. fun to dream !!"
2022,5,"Need provision to add past trips for record keeping purpose, by adding the past dates manually, also add sea journey by ship, also add feature for managing airport lounge access cards"
2019,5,Simply beautiful. very much useful for frequent flyers and those who are planning for a trip.
2023,4,"I've been using kayak for more than 5 years. I liked it better in the past. All the marketing is annoying, but I guess they have to make money"
2023,5,"After trying out a lot of flight-searching apps I think Kayak has the leadership, best experience, best flights."
2023,5,Easy.to use and the app helps you put a whole itinerary together in minutes. I planned a short notice trip in a matter of 48hrs
2019,4,"It's very good app we wish that your partners always write the luggage weights allowed with each ticket, all the best."
2023,4,"This app is easy to use, and it is very accurate. I like the almost ads-free experience."
2022,1,I have booked a flight ticket which took me to Ease my trip website. The payment is done. But I haven't been given the ticket neither to my registered mail Or phone number. What's the issue?
2023,3,Does not cover all options so have to see other sites as well. And fair shown are sometimes different from actula fares.
2020,5,Very easy to use and pulls from all the different travel apps.
2021,5,Great and convenient way to get trip started in as little as no time in a travel agent office as to old traditional way 😀love it .
2022,5,Great APP you can see on the calendar the dates that should be cheaper and the ones more expensive.
2022,2,90% of the time when I click on a deal the page is blank. Must be a bug somewhere.
2023,5,My experience with KAYAK is excellent. I recommend to book with KAYAK.
2020,5,"This app is the best and it meets my expectations you can find flights, cars, and hotels. I love it ♥️"
2021,3,Keeps glitching an signing me out everytime I search. But other than that I love kayak itself for flights. It's the only thing I use
2020,1,I dont want to sign in when using this app and then start getting emails trying to sell. Please go back to how it was as I have stopped using you.
2020,5,Very good apps you can find good hotel at this app.You also can find the cheapest flight tickets .......just need one minute.....
2020,4,Flying to Thailand was a snap with Kayak. Drove to Georgia and back easily finding hotels when I needed sleep and food. Even saved on car rental.
2022,1,"Do not buy tickets with DELTA- I was supposed to have a flight to NYC Thurs 6-15 and and now its Saturday, and they keep pushing it. They keep pushing my flight the next day to the next day and so on. I WILL LOSE MY JOB BECAUSE OF TBEM. I dont know how is this legal- I need some help. ANY LAWYERS OUT THERE."
2021,1,Rating this a one star for inaccurate pricing. Like a solid 50% difference between the listed VRBO price and the actual booking price.
2022,1,"CHEATS... Try to scam you by showing cheaper flight prices at the start and for no reason, the prices are much higher by the time you gonfor payment. Scoundrels!!!"
2021,5,It's just easy to navigate and I like how it saves your searches. Very handy!
2019,5,better than all the others so far. more room selection and lower prices. love the heat maps.
2018,1,I enjoyed using Kayak until I discovered that they shared my personal data with Facebook without my explicit permission. Now uninstalled.
2023,5,very good app and competitive price
2023,4,Good information and reliable
2022,5,"Easy to use makes it easy to organize, plan, and share trip information."
2023,5,Used this app for years to track travel. Easy to use and easy to share access to others with a need to know.
2019,5,"Finally one travel app that works for me. Simple, clear and fast. Bravo"
2022,5,Shows ALl deals from all travel sites so you only have to use 1 app. Thank goodness for that. Always lowest prices
2022,5,Very intuitive search interface and near accurate results. Never disappointed me when it comes finding the best flight
2019,1,They removed the watchlist feature without saying so in the update description. All the hotels on my watchlist are gone.
2019,1,Terrible. Account working fine on desktop site but this does not show trips on android app. Keeps taking me in loops
2019,5,"My favorite travel app. Easy to use, competitive pricing and great service"
2023,5,Love that it checks all the web sights. I used this all the time as a Travel agent. Saved a lot of time
2023,5,Best way to find cheap airfare. Domestic and International. Whether in the U.S. or using from abroad.
2023,5,they always give all options.
2023,4,One of the best travel
2023,5,Love the app. Been using for years
2023,5,my go to site for traveling
2019,5,"best prices from any website I've checked, and enjoy the nearby airports search feature. wish it had more range on nearby airports however"
2019,4,"It's a nice app but it has a fault when you selecting the +/-3 days since the last update, please fix it."
2021,1,"Lists prices for cars as the per day rate (and doesn't say so until check out) to disguise high rental prices, sleazy move."
2022,5,Use this to track flights for myself and family members. Very helpful and accurate.
2023,5,Makes booking simple. I appreciate how easy this app is to use. I travel often for work so I highly recommend it.
2020,1,"This ""middleman"" has become a greedy bloodsucker nowadays. The same services are much cheaper from some other entities. People, consult other booking services before paying anything through kayak. I'm so happy to uninstall this from my device and give it a well deserved rating."
2019,5,"I'm using it for 3 years, and arranged almost 20 flights around the world. The cheepest platform to buy tickets"
2023,5,When I have friends arriving at the airport I use this tool to see when they are arriving. Thank you it is great.
2019,1,"It's returning no flights found for all searches, even though the same searches do return resulta on th website. Please make sure that your app is working before releasing"
2023,5,really clean interface
2023,5,always works way and fast
2020,2,"Online desktop/laptop is still way better. Ok, for basic web searches/pricing. Can't lock in mobile web prices...so why even bother?"
2021,1,"They wouldnt rent me a car for 1 day only, in guadalajara Airport, I was on an express trip and it made my day hell when I got there and they told me that my reservation could not be because I had to rent 2 or more days in order to get a car!!!!"
2021,1,Had a car rental for 13 days. The price was just over $300. Now they want in the upper $400 range. Very unhappy.
2019,4,"Kayak has taken the stress out of my traveling, with great prices and many choices to choose from."
2021,3,"There's 1 thing. It's either missing, or I can't find it. Taking a very long flight to Sao Paulo. I have to use Business class. I don't want economy."
2022,5,"permit lot of search filters, flight tracker, easy to use, amazing."
2019,5,"Gave been using Kayak got years. Whether on the web or on the app, love my easy experience every single time! Very accurate too! Thank you ❤️!"
2023,4,Enjoy getting pricing w/baggage amounts. Most apps show $ for baggage after you are halfway thru thinking about booking.
2023,4,"This is a Outstanding app to use for all your travel, very informative website. Price checks, alerts etc."
2023,5,Very useful app
2023,5,The greatest app for finding flights!
2023,5,It is so helpful and very easy to use.
2023,5,Best app for traveling around the world 👌
2023,5,reliable and cost effective.
2023,5,good clean interface
2023,1,Flight search is not going through!
2023,5,Good for finding flights.
2023,5,Excellent fhe best 'price comparison app i love it
2023,1,Kayak refers you to scammer travel agencies and when you call Kayak they say it's not our problem
2022,5,Great wide open comparison across flights. Un advertised and un compromised. Stay true to yourself Kayak!
2023,5,very nice app
2020,5,Easy to use. Displays multiple options. Displays most airlines for one location with pricing options
2019,5,I always check kayak for the best prices on flights and have been using this site and app for at least a decade.
2020,5,My experience is great! This app gives the information I'm looking for every time and is totally easy to use!!
2022,5,"Very helpful , I used in monthly basis so far NO Surprise ... what you see is what you get !! 👍👍👍"
2022,4,Trying to add a flight to my hotel purchase. Having trouble finding that...but I do like the app so far
2019,5,Great tool. Easy to use. Found some great inexpensive flights. So far very happy with this app.
2019,4,Very easy to use and a good guideline for cheap rates and availability but the prices are not accurate.
2019,5,Excellent and very easy to use and navigate round would recommend to any body
2022,5,Easy to use and have found the CHEAPEST flights from trusted travel sites to Paris. Love it!
2023,5,App is very stable and is the best option for a comprehensive listing of flights and prices.
2019,1,Always a hassle with your bookings . I booked a ticket on the wrong date which it was returnable and I cant cancel it.
2023,1,"App does not narrow down direct flights, despite filtering for direct flights only. Useless."
2019,5,"being in a long distance relationship, for the last 4 years, we do a lot of flying. This is without a doubt the easiest and best way to search flights."
2019,5,good for hotels and flights and finding the cheapest flights with the plus or minus days function that booking doesn't have.
2019,1,Could not verify new account. Never took a password created. I had to uninstall the app.
2023,5,Need a feature to add the details of past old trips by typing the dd/mm/yyyy directly and not selecting from the month-wise calendar
2022,5,I am very happy with Kayak. Every time I have a requirement I find Kayak fares lowest of all booking sites. Thanks Kayak.
2022,1,Worst app. Saying it offers hotels at cheap price. But prices are very high than other apps.
2023,5,Great concept and great execution. Perfect for planning a trip abroad and getting the best prices
2023,1,"Why can't I search flights to Moscow? There are no government regulations preventing that. Any other app can do it including Google flights, but Kayak decided to introduce self censuring."
2019,5,I have been using KAYAK for several years now. I have always found a good hotel or fight with the app. It is dependable and easy to use.
2022,3,I do not know why but there isnt Bulgaria on the Country of Residence Choice and this is a discriminating for sure when other countires and languages are supported.
2023,1,Was working great until it updated and now it keeps crashing while I'm trying to book a hotel.
2019,5,"I travel a lot, used to use Worldmate, tried TripIt but the trips feature of Kayak works the best for me."
2023,2,The Kayak is recruiting people to mislead and trick them to invest their money more and more in the system which falsificates hotel reviews and bookings! They are commiting a crime and there is criminal investigation in Germany! This is complete fraud!
2020,5,"Simple, fast, effective comparison shopping and alerts for best deals."
2023,5,"I love the map view, so when I'm traveling, I can see exactly where the hotels are that I'm interested in."
2019,5,"Great App, use it all the time for the best deals. Kayak has economically arranged my last 4 vacations!"
2019,1,Always used this app but since recent update when you search for airports they are no longer coming up...so skyscanner now for me
2022,4,Great overall but I cannot find my points and I got an email saying they are cancelling the points system.
2023,5,"Great options, search filters and very efficient algorithm for flight search."
2019,1,Very disappointed kept saying my credit card wouldn't work and wanted me to book a much more expensive flight I called the airlines direct and got a lower price
2022,5,"Difficult to find the deals, but the app delivered when it counted. Got a sweet deal. Much recommended"
2019,5,excellent app for flights and hotels. i travel a lot and this is one of my favorite travel apps.
2022,5,Very easy to use with lots of options from flight timings to layover times.
2020,5,"We just booked a flight with KAYAK, it was great.There was so much prices to look at, overall it was a great experiance."
2022,1,These guys also use carjet hire car company who are terrible. I'm still awaiting a refund from the 16th August. No response from carjet. Kayak should screen the hire car companies they use.
2020,5,"Best prices, so many options and you can filter for whatever you want. I just loved this app"
2019,4,exceptional. easier booking would be great but search engine is amazing.
2020,1,Guess they don't want users who might take trips lasting over 2 weeks. Advanced length of trip to 14 days and then it cycles back to 1 day!
2023,5,Excellent app..easy to book and easy to look for options on best prices
2019,5,Amazing app. Great deals. Cheap flights. Easy to compare with other sites.
2020,5,Very easy to use. Keeps track of your searches and advises when prices change
2022,1,I booked flight and after sucessful fund transactions details neither I received email nor ticket... horrible. There is no toll free no. Now what should I do
2019,5,Very user friendly. They have the cheapest flight tickets and car rental by over 20% difference.
2022,4,Works good. But no matter what prices are offered. You always end up having to pay over twice the price.
2020,5,Been using kayak to research flights and prices for years... always decent affordable and accurate. A
2019,2,"After searching, the flight date only shows the tens digit. This has been awhile now."
2023,5,"Great app. Easy to use. Flights, hotels. Very convenient. Recommend anytime."
2021,1,"Worst booking flight app , not helpful. There is no communication between airline and kayak"
2019,5,my first destination when looking for flights. easy to use to has the best prices most of the time.
2018,3,I could not find how to look for same departure and return airport. Should that not be a basic function?
2018,4,"In comparison ,I found this app is neck to neck with Google flight, finding the cheapest & shortest duration flight."
2020,5,Can you please add a function to exclude certain airlines from results? I don't want to fly my national airline as it is pretty bad.
2022,5,"I like being able to see when fares will be low, and the advice to wait or buy now. I've used Kayak for several years."
2019,5,"Love this app, it's great, time saving, pretty accurate, 1st app I go to when starting planning a trip."
2019,1,no phone number for custmer service.my conecting flight got canceled and i have to wait for 18:30 hours in istanboul and the air line said they cant give me a hotel room.pay alteel more with anther app have a good custmer service
2023,5,I think this app has better rates than many others. I like it
2019,1,"apparently, this app shares your search data with Facebook automatically, regadless if you have a Facebook account or not. i dont recall being asked for this behavior. disgusting. uninstalled."
2020,1,These people are Crooks. They let me book a reservation only to be denied when I went to pick up the vehicle and still was charged the full amount that was non-refundable. This should be illegal what these pieces of s*** are doing! Stay away from this scam!
2022,5,Very helpful when traveling for alerts and staying organized.
2018,1,Load of rubbish... cheap fares initially displayed are never actually available. Total waste of time.
2020,5,Always finds good prices. Like the fact you can add baggage so no unexpected fees on top
2022,1,"In 2 minutes after registering with google got a call that I will be charged a lot of money for my Amazon Prime. Scam. Scam. Scam. They sell your data, AVOID! Deleted account immediately, but my data is gone now..."
2019,5,I've been using Kayak for years it's always clear and straight forward and very easy to use..always
2022,2,"After the most recent update, Flights no longer show what type of plane you are flying on. Example- Airbus 320neo."
2020,4,I have found it is cheaper to go directly thru airlines for the last year & a half.
2019,5,"Works great. Has found the best flight prices for my trip, hands down. Will use again!"
2021,4,"The app makes it easy to find rooms in a pinch, I wish it'd add Kayak bookings at the top of the booking list."
2019,5,"I've been a fan for years even before they had the app. Now this allows me to be sitting anywhere and dream about the places in the world I'm gonna be. I love it, thank you for this app."
2021,2,"A very good and fast response app. Though never travel through here ,but am willing to risk it."
2022,2,Used to be my favorite travel app. They are slowly destroying it. This latest update may the the last straw for me.
2019,2,shows you a price then when go to book the price updates and has went up by €60. or it takes you too a site a prices are up by £400 !
2019,1,every single price I've looked looked at is wrong when going to book. this is a absolutely rubbish app.
2022,1,"seems one cannot sort by rating, nor filter by odd-number ratings (less powerful than desktop site)"
2021,1,"Embargo on Cuba flights, even on the UK version of the site - classy. Not."
2020,4,"Be nice to be able to use Google maps in clicking locations, but great app!"
2021,5,Good.app .... sometimes shows the flights and sometimes does not show ... getting puzzled ... but it seems to be better than other apps I've used so far
2023,1,says done but doesn't show any results
2022,5,Enjoy the quick searches and remembering my profile and travel history. Love the Explore piece of the app.
2019,5,So far I love the app! I definitely intend to use the watch list as I am scouting for a good deal.
2022,3,"The app is no longer showing green, red or orange dates on the calendar to show you deals fix ASAP please!"
2019,5,i love how easy and convenient it is to use the app. always finds the best prices for flights!
2020,5,"After last update, today 27-05, the app is back to run like always. Good work! Thanks"
2020,5,I'VE USED KAYAK FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS and it's been my go to traveling website because I've always found amazing deals.. Thanks KAYAK
2019,4,Could be a 5 if they add more of the options that are on the website. Such as searching by deals.
2023,4,Good travel scheduler app. Need a way to import more types of travel docs.
2023,5,Easy to navigate and lots of filters to gear your travel plans customized
2019,5,have been using Kayak for years. No better place to find deals on airfare hotels and car rentals. Saves so much time
2022,1,"None of my bookings were confirmed from this site and was a nightmare for our vacation, never again will I use this junk app"
2023,1,Search keeps failing over and over. I've used many other airline pricing apps with no problems.¯⁠\⁠(⁠°⁠_⁠o⁠)⁠/⁠¯
2023,5,Just super great
2022,5,I love how organized I feel about traveling with kayak and being able to find the best price available.
2023,4,Comprehensive search. Wish they had cruises and travel agency organized tours and trips.
2019,5,"very helpful, secure and easy to use. Also give you the best offer available at the moment."
2018,5,"Well, what can I say...Kayak is, without a doubt, the most user friendly travel agent bot ever."
2023,3,"I would like a little more detail on the size of the rooms. My son ,his Wife ,Children ages from 5month to 6 years old. Need to have room for 2 pack and plays"
2022,5,Easy to compare price. Fast get cheaper ticket. Can travel diff flight in a same trip
2023,5,I just wanted to let Kayak know that you have a booking site called FareScan that is operating on your app. They are known Scam . They took $348.00 of my money a month ago and have not refunded it. Beware of FareScan! They are a Scam.
2023,5,Outstanding App. Definitely first stop for all travel
2023,2,Look at holidays but when try to view deal all I get is a black screen
2021,5,I love this app! I've been able to find some great deals on international flights to Colombia and Cuba.
2019,5,I am finding more flights than I have the time to take! Great prices being found!

2019,1,"useless app. nothing will load, can't sign in, can't even search for airport."
2023,5,Very easy to use and love that it compare multiple websites to find you the best price
2019,1,Uninstalling after writing this review. I don't have a Facebook account as I think the company is evil. Finding out that unrelated companies like Kayak are using their apps to give my data to a FB is very unfortunate. Kayak has lost my trust and won't be regaining it.
2022,5,Powerful search engine with hacker options to find the most travel options.
2019,1,Why would it even ask how many travelers when all the prices are for 1 traveler? False advertising
2019,4,"traveled many places thanks to the great deals on Kayak. no issues with the app, love it :)"
2021,4,What the hell is wrong with your logo? Don't you have common sense. People book flights using your app. The logo has bones makes feel like its flying into graveyard.

2022,5,Easy to use. Loads quickly. Love the explore feature!
2018,5,It's a great app.I can book not only flights but also hotel and cars easily in right time😊

2018,5,"When entering credit cards expiration dates, it would be great to have the month number next to the name of the month!"
2023,4,"Wide range of offerings and deep mining of price comparisons, but can be confusing around availability and luggage qualifying criteria"
2021,1,I really like Kayak but the mobile app is unusable. Keeps on signing me out and says 'account error'.
2023,5,the best way to search for flights

2022,5,Easy to use...Good selection of flights in all travel classes at competitive prices
2023,5,Using it to research flights and hotels for our Italy trip. So useful!
2019,5,"Great for booking flights, easy check out. Highly recommend."
2021,1,App is good but their partnerships are worst..the airline called budgetair just scammed with my 16000 rs..why they do not block such fraud websites..please refund my money you are responsible for it
2023,5,I use Kayak to do initial survey of almost all of my travel. I get a nice overview.
2022,1,"App doesn't let you include more than 4 adults on a search, why? This renders it absolutely useless for me."
2019,1,really not interesting I really would like to see a single person that got a cheap flight using this application
2023,4,App helps to compare prices. I usually beek flights directly with the airline.
2022,1,"Your adds on YouTube are too long and obnoxious. Google has made apps like yours completely useless. You clearly can only cater to suckers and clueless baby boomers. Knock off the obnoxious adds, nobody wants this app!"

Arrived at BWI airport with spirit airlines at 5:15 a.m flight departs at 6:40a.m we argued with the male desk attendant about charging for carry on bag and personal bag up until 6:00. He told us pay the fee for both bags which I thought was free but did so anyway. we came back @6:05 he tells us the gate is closed theirs no more seats on the plane. Mind you I pre booked this flight and the plane departs at 6:40. I am disabled. We lost ALL our money😡
2023,2,Stop referring clients to Agoda: it's the 2nd time they scam me by taking my money and not doing the reservation. Kayak is enabling this shady business.

2022,1,Search engine doesn't work. No results when Kayak online produces lots.
2020,3,"Just for info. for Kayak, the name of the international airport in Dhaka, Bangladesh has changed about 10 years ago. It's no more Zia. It's now Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. Thanks."

2023,1,"I have been using it for years, but there are some issues, i.e.: 1. The emails of a new trip are treated as a continuation of the previous trip. 2. When moving the last trip from the previous trip to a new one, the new trip option is the last choice in a loooong list ( I am a very frequent flyer) and I have to scroll for long time. 3. Because of this unwanted integration of the new trip with the previous trip, it has changed the name of the previous trip. Have to go back to previous trip name."

2023,1,"Wow, I don't like leaving negative reviews. But I have to on this. I booked an airline ticket for international travel using the kayak app and I went directly through the kayak service. They use a third-party called Chatdeal. I now need to make some adjustments to my trip and there is literally no customer service . At the same time they have a special agreement where they lock us out of being able to receive help from the airline directly. Please, don't book through them, use Expedia, etc."
2023,5,"I've used kayak since it's launch on the web, and its app is powerful, fast and fairly simple. I don't love the requirement to use the magic sign-on link though."

2022,5,"Galaxy S8. User since 2013. Countries traveled w/Kayak: 18. 2022 Update: Pros: Great UI, easy to use, loads fast. Cons: -Hotel finder freezes app when used in cities with 2k+ search results **might be my device** -Sketchy sites! Poor regulation of sellers on the app. Kiwi (iffy), mytravel (avoid), and other sites that are exact duplicates. -Nomad feature fun but underdeveloped. Lists prices exorbitantly higher than what individual results yield. -Near pointless rewards program/incentives"

2022,3,The new kayak app will not allow the flight tracker app to run without crashing. Please fix this. The app used to indicate in which baggage claim ares my luggage would be. This has not worked recently. Also the notifications for check-in time have been a bit tardy lately. The cruise itinerary function used to allow for editing of the ports on individual days of the cruise. Please restore this. Thanks for the opportunity to comment.
2022,4,"Thrilled with the app. Intuitive to say the least. I also appreciate flexibility and the overwrite feature. Could we build a world map pinpointed of the locations most visited offering more visual than just statistics,."
2022,5,"What I love about kayak is it keep my trips very organized and on top of that it allows me to independently track flights up to 3 days in advance which is better then some dedicated flight tracker apps and saves them so you can track multiple flights, which comes in handy as I have a B&B and offer pickups and dropoff from the airport."
2022,4,"Kayak has regained a lot of lost credibility with various upgrades over the past year that are bona fide improvements. There's still one annoyance about carry on and hold luggage resetting every time you make a change, but still overall, much better"
2022,5,"Day of the week search is amazing! Thank you, thank you! Getaway planning made easy right here!"

Update: When using multiple day search (+/- days) the results vary depending on the date picked even if you choose one of the overlapping dates. App has really continually gotten worse with updates.

2021,1,"Was a great way to search for flights. I have used a lot of other ways to search and this is the best. I wish that once a filter was set, it stayed set as I search through different airports. The hide Basic Economy option does nothing. It would be nice if it did. Since having some updates, the app is pretty much useless. It fails to search for nearby airports and it fails to bring up all the flights within your filters until you clear them."
2021,5,👍🏼
2021,1,"This used to be my go-to app. But, the fact that I just opened it up and was greeted with this... ""How to travel safely as an LGBTQ+ traveler"" has me disappointed :( Let me clarify that while I don't condone the behavior of these individuals I'm not trying to lash out at the people themselves who choose to live this lifestyle. However, at the same time I definitely can't support corporations that choose to openly promote this agenda."
2021,3,"With the last update, the ""trip length"" parameter/slide under the ""time"" icon is no longer available. That was the only option under ""time"" that was useful to me and that I used every time. You can keep the current parameters just BRING BACK THE ""TRIP LENGTH"" OPTION !!!!!"

2021,5,[Update on 04/13/21]: we can make +/- 3 days search on the app so changed the rating to 5 now.. We cannot do +/- 3 days for round trip as we can do on the website... and would be good to have +/- 3 days for multi city trip as well.

If it weren't for my son thinking he heard a shower running in our hotel room, that is what would've happened. There is a lot more about what Travelocity did to create the situation, but I'll describe that elsewhere. Since I got to Travelocity via Kayak, I wish the app had some way of warning people of bad travel sites."

2020,2,"I have to lower my rating for this app. Over the years it became more difficult to use. The newest layout (as of 3/30/20) is horrible. Why would you have options to pick flights - hotels - cars AND a search bar that does not have any function other than.... Opening a new screen. If you select what you want by clicking on the icon (flight, hotel or car) why do you have to click on the 'search box' again in order to finally start putting your cities and dates? This adds completely unnecessary step"
2020,1,"This used to be a 5⭐ app, but over time it's gotten harder and harder to find the steps to use the main feature, which is the flight tracker. I can't find it at all now, amongst all the junk about social media and booking hotels and whatever. It's time to uninstall it. Sad to see a good app get so messed up."

2019,5,"Best app for finding low cost airfare that I've been able to find ANYWHERE, and I've looked almost everywhere online. It is super simple, and easy to use it even includes an option of adding additional baggage ( i.e carry on & up to 2 checked bags)fees to the total cost of the airfare. This is only app that I have found that has this, and baggage fees are very important because of the total amount spent. Go and try it out, what have you got to lose. It also includes car, and hotel searches."
2019,5,"August 2015 - I enjoy using it all the time. Really helpful. December 2019 - still a very good place to find and order a flight, car or hotel. The price doesn't change like it happens with other apps."
2020,5,"Still loving it. But... I've been using Kayak for a number of years and for the 1st time I had a ""surprise fee"" appeared on my card account, days after I booked. The booking went through Flighthub and I am not sure why."

2019,1,Me mandaron la confirmación del hotel garantizada y al llegar al hotel me dicen que no tenían habitaciones disponibles. Tanto planear el viaje con anticipación para que Kayak lo arruinara. Pésimo! Aparte me cobraron y ahora tengo que pelearme con el banco.
2019,5,"I continue to rate this App 5 stars predominantly based on being the only App of this kind that offers multi-city. Not to mention, this App is quick, reliable (always works) and intuitive."
2019,5,Thanks to kayak I always get the cheapest flights!!! Better then a Google search!!

2019,3,"had to take out one star because on a few occasions it showed outdated air prices or non existent fares. also, the developers didn't seem to respond to the feedback in my earlier review below. Nice app! 2 suggestons: can you guys make an option to save settings: non stop, departure times, airlines, airports? Each new search I have to go over all settings again. Also, table view for +/-n days in the web site version is much more convenient than the list view."
2019,1,I captcha da browser in modalità anonima sono noiosissimi. 2 minuti per accedere alla mia ricerca.
2019,5,This app is the best because it gives you prices from each brand's website which tend to be lower.

2019,4,they've got to allow filters when using theme based searches so you can eliminate unrealistic horrible options like Spirit Airlines.

2019,3,Including dreams is deceptive. They skew the Kyak results because of slow updates. Flight for 5 days was listed for $300 less than actual ticket.
2019,2,Blunt instrument. Have to re-enter filter options every time the search is ammended. Could be much better.
2019,4,"hmmm... still, one top best search apps, worx pretty well and you can quickly find rates"

2018,1,USE SKYSCANNER TO AVOID KAYAK DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING. Typically the fares advertised noon Kayak DO NOT EXIST. Skyscanner- on the other hand- consistently has accurate and real prices. You may want to avoid the false advertising in numerous junk mails and just go with another service. Kayak CANNOT BE RELIED ON.
2018,5,"I use kayak pretty much exclusively for finding flights, and the app does not disappoint. The tracker is very useful. Update: now unusable, interface is huge and many fields/buttons off screen, and you can't resize! What happened??"
2018,5,"Never seems to go wrong and the backup team are very quick to rectify errors if they occur (certainly that's my experience from Windows Phone). It's easy, intuitive and frankly the best place to start when booking plane tickets."
2018,5,"Siempre me gusta comparar precios antes de comprar pasaje y usualmente tenía que entrar diversas páginas para hacerlo. Desde que empecé a usar Kayak no necesito nada más. Los filtros son excelente uno puede escoger horarios especificos en que desea buscar los vuelos, aeropuertos ,líneas aéreas. Incluso la herramienta de explorar que te da la oportunidad de escoger un mes y ver las tarifas alrededor del mundo es lo más que me gusta! este año viaje 5 veces y todos los vuelos los busque por Kayak!"

2018,1,Trying to book an international flight. Constantly displays WRONG fares! Always 20%-30% more expensive when I click on booking. Says not available anymore. But ALL THE TIME! Don't understand the positive reviews here. Apparently nobody actually books a flight. They all just check the (wrong) fares *rolleseyes*
2018,4,"This is the best of the travel sites, searching the best the Web he's to offer for travel in A few clicks or in this case touches. I cannot recommend this app and site enough. Whenever I so much as just want to get a quote for a rental car for work or plane tickets to Vegas. Slick app. Swag"
2018,5,"I find the app very useful for keeping track of the bookings that I make prior to starting out on a trip, all organised for me automatically once I forward the email confirmations of the bookings"
2018,5,"Gr8 very comfortable and a quick app for finding flights , hotels"

2018,4,"Ads used to be the same size as the other listings. Now they're huge, take up 2 screens worth of scrolling, and pop up while scrolling or attempting to click on a listing. This type of advertising doesn't work, no one wants it, and its driving people away from the app. EDIT: Thank you very much for fixing the ad issue. I had quit using it for a while, but after last update, the ads have went back to a reasonable size, and no longer take over the screen while scrolling"
2018,5,10/22/18 Gets better and better Managing itinerary and check in and now trip notes. One stop shop! Latest updates put this app in a class all by itself. Wonderful! Free and no ads! Best travel app on the market. Love that you can copy key flight information. Well done. Recommend it every chance I get.
2018,5,"After the longest time, hotel maps are finally scrollable. Something as basic as this should not have taken forever to implement. Airfares are also mostly accurate and there are no nasty price shocks at the end of the booking process."

2018,4,"I use it a lot to search for flights, especially the flight fare tracker. I don't book too often on the app though. It takes too long. I'll go to a computer for the full site instead."
2018,3,I wish you could pick several airports as options to fly out of and several airports as options to fly into. That way it will find the cheapest flight by mixing and matching between the airports.
2018,5,Very useful app to book flights and hotels. One of the best neatly arranged UI and tons of useful functions.
2018,5,Hacker fare is the best... Most useful app ever..

2018,1,The app will change prices while trying to book. It will sometimes lose the flights you are looking at. Overall just go on a computer and complete. This is total garbage.
2018,3,"It's good but when you try and share it a second time to another app it won't let you, only gives the same opinion"
2018,5,"I love the filters of Kayak that allow me to choose the duration of flight, flexible dates, and especially the airline alliance filter option which helps a lot!"
2018,5,Great app to use with Google flights to find the best deals
2018,4,Great app. But I hate giving reviews!
2018,5,Still love it the way I loved it 3 years ago

2018,4,Easy to use. Unsure if it saves money but it's very useful.
2018,3,"Hey Kayak, please fix your app to allow it to show all available flights for multi city trips. In the search I did, I got like 4 results while on your website I get a gigantic number of options. Also, would be great if I could put a tracker /reminder on multi city trips"
2018,5,"Terrific app. Always shows the best, most competitive prices. The only minor pesky thing is when it takes kind of long to show the final price. I'm not sure if its a gimmick to watch the price dropping or if it actually takes that long."
2018,2,"The location finder doesnt work. A bunch of the filters ACT like they're working but, block out things they shouldn't and let in things they shouldn't."
2018,5,"This is a great app. I use this all the time whenever I decide to travel 
easy to use. Also like getting updates when prices for flights drop."
2018,5,"Simple ro use. Easily understood and helpful in not only finding a great 
price but in finding places to go, even at the last minute."
2018,3,I havent booked anything yet once i have ill let you know. Thanks :)
2018,3,"For some reason on many searches the hacker fares appear briefly then disappear, making it frustrating to price out many trips"
2018,5,"I like this app it's extremely very nice ,I can book the ticket for cheapest price and apart from that kayak makes me to know the price even to my local currency"
2018,5,Search is easy and brings the best competitive prices. Its a useful app.
2018,5,I wish you guys would include package deals! I hope I am missing that part when I submit this!!
2018,1,"Because this app support scamers like travelgenio and still showing travelgenio flight even after i filtered it out, its completely useless"
2018,1,"Tried to sign up a dozen different times through Facebook and Gmail. Never 
let me create an account."
2018,1,"Searched for holidays in Greece, and it gave me results for Bali - Epic 
Fail."
2018,4,Its really nice app I found cheapest deal compare to others
2018,1,Car rental price quote doesn't include tax with Holiday Cars
2018,5,"Me gusta mucho la interfaz de Kayak, simple, bonita e intuitiva!"
2018,1,"Garbage, price was listed as 500 got charged 750"
2018,5,Love that there is no pressure (e.g. only 1 left) and that it compares other sites
2018,5,Thank you for the app God bless all in Jesus name we pray

2018,5,"My favorite thing about the Kayak app is that it is the very best with 
solving one of the most painful parts of traveling: keeping all your 
various reservations saved in one place. The itenerary view is so very 
valuable while on the road. Thanks so much for this great feature and great 
application!"
2018,1,"This app is a lie. Have not booked one of the low prices I've chosen. It 
times outs to ensure you did not get it. Tried to book a $450 flight and 
now's it's $2500. Ridiculous, done that 3x."
2018,4,"Like the feature that let's you see the prices from one airport around 
other places in the US. Super awesome when you're not locked in to a date 
and can just travel at will, but still at a decent price."
2018,5,"Kayak app saved me Rs.2000/- for flight ticket, which showed 3500/- where 
all others top rated apps like make my trip etc showed same ticket price 
for 5900/-. Finally purchased through Kayak."
2018,4,"Great app so far, trying to plan a trip to Europe. I hope this app will be 
helpful for that."
2018,5,"Got best rates in market for international flights. Can't say the same 
about hotels."
2018,5,It is wonderful site to get the real insight of any flight. Thank you KAYAK
2018,4,"Wonderful app! However, please add more payment options like debit cards, 
wire transfers, KayakWallet etc."
2018,1,"Clickbait app, prices not as advertised. Not recommended app!"
2018,5,"Is very easy to use, the sim pl locityvis the best part, not complicated 
with adds and a million offers like other sites."
2018,5,Love the new layout of the app! Smooth stream line.
2018,5,"Best app I've found for plane tickets love the variable days and multiple 
stops option."
2018,1,Not easily possible to change the currency of prices.
2018,5,"Great app to simplify the process of finding places to stay when travelling 
and to speed up loading of the web interface."

2018,5,"Been using Kayak for a good number of years now but recently Kayak has 
stopped showing my travel information in Trips. I have to forward multiple 
email confirmations yet it still does not register. Otherwise, still good."
2018,2,"App is good, able to search cheapest deal, catch is when you view actual 
detail on vendors website, price is different. That's misleading."
2018,5,"Love that it has hotels and flights showing the prices as well. Very useful 
and complete app."
2018,5,"Very useful apps.. I use it to check and book flight tickets.. one of the 
best apps"

2018,5,No
2018,3,"I was looking for an app to use as an alternative to google flights, 
especially for flight price tracking since I don't feel like I get all the 
price updates. Even though kayak shows me several flights for under 100 
euros in the flight search for a specific flight, the watchlist and alerts 
I receive always say that the cheapest option is at 126 euros (with no 
flight at that price in the search list). I guess I have to look further..."
2019,2,"Kayak has gone downhill. Kayak uses too many third parties to book cars. Literally could not get an answer from kayak or third party. When you call kayak they advise they cannot do anything with reservations. Also, I could not talk to the human. I had to contact my credit card company to get assistance."
2018,1,"Tried booking flight and gave all credit card details and information and 
then went to directed site to have to start again. Felt dodgy. Try to 
register, add all details and nothing happens. Waiting for a positive for 
this site."
2018,4,"I love the app but it really needs a Trip widget. This widget could show 
flight updates and upcoming travel plans. That would make my life so much 
easier."
2018,5,"App is very user friendly. I enjoy the fact Trip Advisor reviews are shown. 
Very trustworthy and true descriptions. Much better than a few I have used 
in the past."
2018,5,"Great prices multiple options to book car, hotel, flights all around great 
app for everything you need"
2018,5,"I could not believe how simple the app is to use and very user friendly.. 
Great stuff"
2018,5,"Love this app! Good for planning trips I'll actually take or just living 
vicariously :)"
2018,3,"Why can't I get to my boarding pass!!?? It only pops after check-in there 
is no separate way to get to it, so if you move away from the boarding pass 
screen you're screwed"
2018,4,"Simply put, it works... except when it asks to refresh, it deletes your 
search filters"
2018,5,"Great app. It helped me find great prices and its really good and easy to 
use"
2018,5,"Plan my first trip overseas for time and found easy to use and great deals 
already planning my next trip overseas"
2018,4,Works good. Use it as a starting point for pricing
2018,5,Oly excellent application to find the best get away. Thank you.
2018,1,The updates to this app has made it unusable. That's unfortunate...
2018,5,"The prices are the best I've ever found and I search all over for bargan 
flights"
2018,5,Love the options. Love that it shows you the competitors prices.
2018,5,"Kayak is quick and nimble, light weight but most effective. I like it very 
much."
2018,5,Love it. Has helped me find reasonably priced flights last minute.
2018,1,Wants me to setup a phonelock before use. NO
2018,5,"great one..just add against hotel that whether they are couple friendly or 
not plz"
2018,5,Great app... Thanks!

2018,5,Thanks Kayak!
2018,5,Nyc one
2018,4,Really useful app but... I cannot see my notes on the Android app. I can add notes on the PC where they remain visible but cannot find them on the Android app. This reduces the usefulness of the app as I cannot keep all my trip information in one place. Help!
2018,4,"Love this app except one drawback. When you search fare for more than one 
passenger , including free infant than it will mess up with fare shown. For 
example if full fare for each adult is $100 and child is $20. Then if you 
search for 2 adults and 1 infant, it should total up to $220. Then kayak 
will divide that fare by three person and show $73. But when you are 
redirected to booking site it end up showing original $100 fare. Apart from 
this, all amazing."
2018,5,"Great app, helped me save over $100 on flight tickets for my family to fly 
over and visit. Highly recommend as I've gotten better prices than all the 
other apps and sites I've used."
2018,5,"Great app! Gives a wide variety of options to decide on flights, hotels, 
and others. 🤗"
2018,5,"Useful tool for finding flights or hotels. At the very least, it can help 
you compare prices which can vary among websites."
2018,1,"No real purpose to this app. It just searches for stuff you can do on any 
number of other sites but this makes it a painful experience."
2018,5,"Kayak got my girlfriend and I a $800 roundtrip flight to Italy! I love this 
app!"
2018,1,"Exact Same flight shows up 10 times guessing they meant to show 10 seats 
left but instead shows the same flight before showing other options"
2018,5,Amazing app for searching flights. Always my first stop!
2018,5,Great app. No complains at all. 100% recommended
2018,2,"""The selected room is no longer available"" -> search again -> still showing 
unavailable rooms"
2018,1,"DO NOT USE. This app glitched when I attempted to book a flight, and as a 
result the flight was booked with the WRONG dates."
2018,3,"Currency must need to change.can easy calculation any country Singapore or 
US $"
2018,5,"Really Accessible, great prices. Like the layout"
2018,3,I need motels with truck parking. Please add this to the amenities list.
2018,1,App only shows half the price for a ticket.
2018,5,Showing flight rates much cheaper than skyscanner and others!!
2018,1,Why price is only mentioned in Dollar? I want euro
2018,5,The most accurate app for finding cheap flights.
2018,5,It changes flights automatically to give you different options
2018,5,Just got ...love it though!!!found cheap ticket finally ...in 2 MIN!!!!
2018,5,"Great app, easy to use."

2018,1,"Absolutely horrible customer service. Very rude people..sorry your app 
changes the date when I'm trying to.book a hotel. I acknowledged yes, it 
was my mistake for not triple.checking the date (who expects a date to 
change from.what is searched) and simply asked of there was anything that 
could be done to help. A simple no would have sufficed not being snapped 
and and talked to in that manner. And on a side note, the hotel 
acknowledged that it shouldn't have happened and is working to try and 
cancel.it. they were very nice. Even if they can't their customer service 
was the opposite of kayaks."
2018,2,"Flights via Expedia and Orbitz show prices that are not current. I keep 
reentering passenger information and get error messages that I am not 
entering information correctly or that there is an issue with seat 
assignments. In truth the Kayak prices are not being honored by the 
airlines. Kayak should just say ""Ticket price no longer available."""
2018,3,"I like to book vacation packages which saves me money. I wasn't able to do 
so here. Only allows me to search hotel and flight separately which costs 
more."
2018,5,"Love the ""Anywhere"" option that kayak offers where you can see where you 
can go on a budget all over the world. Also, after checking multiple sites 
when I buy tickets, I have found kayak to be the most cheap 100% of the 
time. App is also easy to use and straightforward! Great job!"
2018,3,"There's no way that ORD to LAX is the exact same price of $699 year round. 
Something is wrong with the app."
2018,2,"Can't even let u select the dates u want to travel. What is this? Worst 
experience ever."
2018,5,"Love the explore section where you can see a maps with deals for flights to 
anywhere in the world"
2018,4,Fine App found flights for good price and clicked through to book easily
2018,3,"need the ability to easily change the notification sound so I don't mistake 
every alert for a txtmsg"
2018,4,"I would really like to be able to set a mile preference for ""nearby 
airports"" or be able to pick multiple departure options"
2018,3,"Definitely buggy when trying to register an account under Facebook and 
Google..."
2018,3,"When searching for a flight, don't know what the progress is on the search."
2018,5,Very good. Keep searching and eventually you will find what you want *****
2018,5,"Makes it easy to find an optimal flight......love the explore option as 
well."
2018,5,Best app out there for cheap flight tickets

2018,3,"Uninstalled after only half an hour. Utter rubbish refuses to show me 
flights for my selected dates, when I say I want to fly anywhere on a 
specific date that doesn't mean I want to fly 10 days earlier! Siged me out 
after 20 minutes and refused to recognise Facebook there after very 
disappointing"
2018,2,"Was good years ago. Now Kayak overdoes the cookies on my searches to 
manipulate pricing. Worse yet, they throw out the budjet airlines like 
airasia right in the middle of search results loading, and other times 
doesn't show them at all. Good search platform in general."
2018,5,"I downloaded multiple apps looking for plane tickets. This app takes the 
cake! Super user friendly, easy to navigate, and THE best price out of all 
of them! 10 out of 10 will use again and have already told my friends to 
use this app!"
2018,4,"Very useful app. Two more things to make it s perfect. 1. Including 
terminal number 2. Including gate number when known or updated."
2018,3,"Better than trivago, trawl means to catch fish, you might want to look up a

2018,2,"When I say beachfront I do not mean 2 blocks away!!! Useless app if filters

2018,5,Beautiful
2018,5,Good
2018,5,Good
2018,1,Extremely overpriced
2018,5,My go to flight comparison app!
2018,1,"There's no reason for you to now require access to my photos and files, 
both on the device and SD card. Stop with the needless overstepping and 
intrusions. If that wasn't bad enough, the app has had 5 updates in less 
than 2 weeks. Apparently, these fools cant get it right. If an update isn't 
ready, don't release it. Learn to test appropriately before wasting our 
time. Previously rated 4 stars, but this juvenile and amateurish behavior 
is getting out of hand with incompetent developers. Kayak is far from the 
only one, but enough is enough. I've lost my patience for stupidity. If I 
waste time updating, and the next day another update is released, it means 
you're a moron."
2018,5,"I always use Kayak to start my travel searches. It helps me to hone in on 
the best flights for my needs at the best price across many carriers. 
UPDATE: I LOVE the trips function . Having all my confirmations and 
itinerary in one place is so handy. I'm often in charge of planning for 
multiple people and being able to have it all put together to share with 
everyone is great!"
2018,5,"Does a great job... Hey Tech Heads.... Under Events Could you please 
include all modes of transport or at least add the following just like the 
Train event including departure and arrival ports and coach terminals Ferry 
Cruise Line Bus and Coach Thanks"
2018,4,"Looking like a very clean app, and more clear than TripIt. What's missing 
to give it a 5 star rating is a widget showing current and past trips, hope 
to see a widget soon and up the rating to 5."
2018,4,"Only started using the app but so far I am enjoying it. Nice user interface 
and easy to use..."
2018,5,"Kayak is quick and easy to use. Great for getting a feel for price trends, 
as well."
2018,1,Please explain me. We trying buy ticket for friend. But fault why?
2018,4,Good app to find quick destinations flight. I really appreciate it.
2018,5,Way cheaper flights then Expedia had.
2018,5,Awesome... tracking my elderly mom's flights...
2018,5,A Great App To Get Best Rates to Travel

2018,5,Very good
2018,1,"I started using this app to plan a trip in a few months and got excited 
looking at the prices and everything. Well when it redirects me to the 
website. The prices are all 200 more than what this app reports. So I went 
back and refreshed the search and everything, but still the prices are 
severely different than what the airline is charging."
2018,1,"Prices quoted change far too often when you actually try and book. Multiple 
examples and it's not due to the price changing during the booking process. 
Avoid unless you want to use it for very rough indicative purposes or to 
check flight times"
2018,3,"The advice note watch or buy change all the time but not the prices? so not 
sure if is working properly. My notifications are On but have not receive 
any yet after having the app for 4 weeks now. Improve the app. Is ok but it 
could b great."
2018,1,"I gave it one start because there is no filter to set *minimum* number of 
days. All the flights offered are for 1-2 days. What's most infuriating is 
that there is already a filter for maximum number of days, so adding a 
minimum should be trivial."
2018,1,"What's the point of ""per person"" when you fly with a lap infant? 
Uninstalled it. Update: Three years later, I forgot that I ever installed 
it and faced the same issue. Uninstalling."
2018,1,"This app sucks for notifying you of price deals. It will tell you when it 
was the lowest price that you missed instead of notifying you when to buy 
at the lowest price. I don't need to know the money I COULD have saved. I 
need to know the money I CAN save."
2018,1,"I booked one flight and it got cancelled, the worst part is the customer 
service are unreachable. Never ever use Kayak to book your flights. 
NEVERRRRRRR"
2018,5,"Best travel search site. Unlike other sites shows prices from all main 
players. V. convenient n fast."
2018,5,"Greatest travel site I ever used. So great for comparing prices, tons of 
choices, detailed but sleek overlay, I loved it!"
2018,5,"I really like the 'explore' feature! I found my next trip! Booking and 
payment was almost to easy!"
2018,1,"Not even close to GOOD Deals really very expensive when I compare the same 
flights with the airline own websites RUBBISH"
2018,5,"Easy to use and best price comparison app. Also it's price predictor for 
flight prices is very accurate"
2018,5,"Great for having all trip information in one place. Does not give you ALL 
airline prices"
2018,1,"App doesn't work , ive uninstalled & installed several times , waste of 
time kindly fix the bug.."
2018,5,I really like the prices and options. Very good app
2018,5,"Amazing ""Explore"" feature for cheap flights within the U.S. and worlwide"
2018,5,"Easy to use, good info for planning a trip."
2018,4,Easy to use to scan prices. Some times shows outdated prices.
2018,4,"very good and very user friendly app .. I can find what i am looking for 
easily"
2018,5,"I use this app to comparison shop for plane tickets. This app is much more 
useful and usable than expedias app"
2018,5,Kayak app is just as reliable & easy to use as their awesome website.
2018,5,Wow its the best thing that ever happened to bookings...
2018,5,Very good app but could we have the option of flight + car as well ?
2018,5,Love this app! Very easy to use..
2018,5,Very good if u are searching cheap air tickets
2018,3,Really haven't used it yet.
2018,5,Easy to use. Filters are very helpful.
2018,4,how am i gonna rate... if i havent started yet
2018,1,No help... Websites gives you unexpected charges
2018,5,I think kayak is better than cheap flights
2018,5,Just started traveling a lot big help

2018,5,Always helps me out
2018,4,I like to improve
2018,5,Never lets you down
2018,1,"The prices they show are great, but when it comes down to actually being 
able to book your flights.. It's a nightmare!!!!! Especially Vayama that 
offers flights... So it seems Kayak likes to use companies that try to scan 
you and are questionable. When trying to book 2 adults and an infant... 
Nobody seems to be able to do it, Vayama told me I had to book the adult's 
tickets and call the airline to add the infant. They said it was how I had 
to do it, easy and not much to add an infant. WRONG!! NIGHTMARE!! I had to 
cancel my flights with Vayama after talking to the airline because they 
said that was rediculous, the only way to add an infant to my existing 
flight and tickets would be to go directly to the airline in person..4 hour 
drive for me. I had to then go online with the anything I had originally 
booked flights with Vayama and book then directly with the airline. Ended 
up costing me about $150.00 more but I got my flights booked. WARNING, 
DON'T USE VAYAMA!! ESPECIALLY WHEN BOOKING INFANTS WITH YOU!!"
2018,4,"First time using it, and so far it's way better the Expedia. The entire set up is easier to navigate; and although prices are slightly higher, I'm at least getting exactly what I need."
2018,2,"This does not show all airlines. Not even United. 650 dollar tickets, but 
with United 400. It would cost me 250 if I only relied on kayak."
2018,1,"The app gives great prices and when you decide to book the price is another 
much higher. For example one flight goes from aud 1355 on the app to usd 
1800 when you tap to buy it."
2018,5,"Great layout, the trips feature is amazing, and the filters for searching 
are second to none. Used to be an Orbitz girl, but Kayak is my new number 
one."
2018,1,"The only thing and most important matter to me when using flight apps is, the fact that you have to put each individual Airport you you want to fly from, you can't just select UK and let the app find the cheapest flight, which you can do on Skyscanner also found cheaper flights."
2018,2,Unfortunately all the discount airlines no.lonher show on kayak..hmm guess what I can no.longer use this app :(
2018,5,"It's a very good app and easy to use. Gives the cheapest airfare possible 
and purchasing ticket is very easy too."
2018,5,Just want quick airfares And it's great at that ... and hotels too
2018,5,Kayak is a very helpful app and helps me with traveling alot!
2018,4,"User friendly, saved me some$$"
2018,5,Great app. Love the fare tracking.
2018,5,it a great app thank you for creating it..
2018,4,Good app to plan travel
2018,5,All my tickets purchased was through KAYAK I am still since meny years.
2018,1,I can't select the dates I need for my trip
2018,5,Helped me get through 7 flights from North America to Europe for under 1.5k
2018,5,Very good app!
2018,5,Great App. Love it
2018,5,Its sooo easy to use..

2018,5,ابداع هذا التطبيق
2018,5,Goodddddd
2018,5,A ok
2018,3,The app is inconsistent when using the +/-3 days option. A cheap Wingo flight BOG-UIO on May 17th IS found when using exactly that date +/-3 days but NOT when using May 16th +/-3 days. That is plain wrong and still makes you have to search all individual dates.
2018,4,great looking UI and best way to search for flights. the mytrips feature is great but I wish Kayak could add digital airline tickets to it. The sameway passbook does on the iPhone. Kayak you should do this. It would separate you from all others and would be a great feature.
2018,5,Love price tracking. Would like to see a feature to search multiple airports not just what is nearby. Such as Europe is very train connected can I fly to cologne and take a train to Dusseldorf for less kind of thing.
2019,1,"I paid for the ""pro"" app years ago. Since stopping support, I have the pleasure of ""sponsored"", ""suggested"" and straight-up ad results. No thanks. Obviously uninstalled"
2018,5,I like that Kayak gives you comparisons across pretty much all airlines and this app is very easy to use and set up notifications. It packs a lot of information into the screen without seeming cluttered. Love it!
2018,4,"Love that you can use the app to combine all info about your trip. I would like to be able to see the itinerary at a glance more clearly, and maybe include a maps feature"
2018,4,Just used it. Linked to Google account. not sure if that's a good thing yet
2018,5,"I love this app, and I will love more if Kaykar give me one free trip to New York! ❤️💜"
2018,5,Its an amazing app it shows you everything the prices of flights Hotels etc i love it and i dont have to struggle anymore..
2018,5,Love the option to automatically see prices for similar dates.  My travel dates are usually flexible and this is a great tool that saves me time.
2018,4,"Very good. The best app for buy flies, reserve hotels and rent cars."
2018,5,"It is a good app for taking care of everything for trips. I had to change trips twice, and customer service was great."
2018,1,Watchlist is now completely broken. Shows impossibly low fares that never are bookable. Please fix!
2018,5,Love kayak!  Its convenient and awesome to search for possible trip fantasies and itineraries.
2018,4,"It gives you a quick glance of the prices offered.. be it flight, hotel or car.."
2018,4,I've used kayak for a long time now. It's convenient and finds great prices.
2018,1,Fui lesado. Aluguei um carro via Kayak na FOCO Aluguel de Carro e não foi disponibilizado. É  golpe!!!!
2018,1,Sponsors Laura Ingraham's show on Fox. I need to make travel plans not support that kind of toxic trash TV.
2018,5,Just dowbloaded it. But seems great and so user friendly
2018,1,Your app is showing Rs.500/- more than other cheap flights app.I uninstalled your app.
2018,5,user-friendly works very well
2018,4,Don't often buy through kayak but it's always my first search
2018,4,Really useful to compare all the prices in once
2018,5,Its a very good app it helps out a lot!!!
2018,5,Love it... versatility at its best!
2018,5,Very powerfull apps for looking flight arrangement

2018,5,Awesome
2018,5,Marvellous
2018,1,No good
2018,5,Gucci
2018,3,My only problem with it is the updates and alerts when it comes to flights and hotels on the watch list. It never alerts you when there is a price change and honestly doesn't track it that well. Went to go look at a hotel I've been scoping out for a trip to see what the prices were looking like. On the watch list it was still the price I had originally seen it at. When I clicked on it to go book it it had gone up nearly $80 with no notification even though it was on my watch list. Other than that it's an easy to manage app I just wished it updated the user better.
2018,1,"Go to Orbitz, Kayak is a poor service that doesn't keep it's word. They have very unresponsive customer service and will tell you what you want to hear just to get rid of you then not follow through."
2018,5,"This app is amazing! It is so quick and easy to find flights all around the world. Definitely lives up to what the app claims to be, far beyond  my expectations. Kayak is the future of booking flights, hotels and rental cars."
2018,1,Garbage turd of a middleman company with outdated results and inflated prices. Customer support does not give a f. Save money by booking directly
2018,4,"Application is very reasonable for search for domestic flights in the US, also provides advice to buy or to wait not sure of accuracy. I would recommend it."
2018,5,I use kayak to book almost all my flights! I love it. I also love using Kayak explore to plan future travel. Its great
2018,1,"Very bad, can not search within a certain city. It displays all hotels in the whole country."
2018,4,Love this app so far! It even includes hostels and has a way to explore seasonal flight deals to destinations around the world!
2018,5,Love the stats for trips! Finally I don't have to calculate how many miles I've flown. Thanks Kayak!!!
2018,5,"Kayak is easier than checking individual websited, and it's the most comprehensive flight finder I've found so far. It's my first stop flight finder every single time I fly."
2018,1,Been trying to use this with my Chromebook Flip for over a year....still a no go because it won't let me sign in to my Kayak account.
2018,4,I use this app when planning all of my travelling. The trip alerts are helpful too.
2018,5,"Nice app, compare the price. Now I can book my ticket from my home."
2018,5,Dope app. Use it. Easy to use and definitely helps finding great deals for you!
2018,5,"Good, keep them flights cheap. That's why we like it"
2018,5,"I've been using this  app for a very  short time, but so far it seems easy to use, intuitive. It's also very quick."
2018,3,Great app but unfortunately doesn't include low cost airlines...limited
2018,5,"Intuitive use, good deals - makes booking travel easy"
2018,5,"Amazing app, navigation and deals are great!"
2018,1,Rates Only Dollars. No use in India as there is no convention option.Useless for INDIA
2018,5,677 dolars for costa rica feankfurt round trip. No words
2018,4,I like the fact that it shows me the lowest fares so I can do one stop shopping.
2018,4,Easy to use and great to have multi-city search and price watch.
2018,4,This app is good easy to use you can compare with other  ticket price
2018,5,"It's easy, it shows you multi options, I would've never thought of. No annoying pop up's."
2018,1,"It just stopped working, so I uninstalled it."
2018,5,"If you are looking for an app to find travel deals for flexible travel dates, Kayak's your app!"
2018,5,I am not able to compare airlines from Mexico.  Only airlines from the U.S. please help
2018,5,Great one stop travel planning / booking app

2018,4,Offers a lot of cheaper option to fly
2018,5,"Kayak found a resort in Florida I only dreamed of going to, during spring break for a special price none other of the other apps had. I can't wait!!"
2018,4,"Good for planning out trips, as well as, comparing the prices of the big 3 when ever you travel."
2018,4,Used it for flight booking....pretty easy to try different booking arrangements quickly to look for the best price.
2018,1,Kayak app is a scam. Shows higher flight prices in app versus their website. Crooks!!
2018,5,Great trip planning interface. The desktop version is much nicer though.
2018,1,Doesn't give the option to change currency. For a travel app this is ridiculous.
2018,5,I always use this site for all of our travel needs!!! Love it!!
2018,5,This is my first time planning a trip and this made it so easy I booked a trip in less than 10 minutes when I try it on the computer on other sites I was confused and left frustrated I am so grateful for this app now I am on my way to LA
2018,5,Quick way to find lots of options and good deals  : -)
2018,4,All at one place. Great app.
2018,4,It's a cool application and helped a lot!

2018,5,Hacker prices are never available
2018,5,Like it
2018,1,"Booked a car and went to pick it up to find out they were out of cars. Per the agent, the sites list cars that aren't available to push inventory. This completely messed up our travel plans as we have to scramble to find a car and pay more."
2018,4,"Why is it that when your travel forecast recommends ""buy now"" that my lowest ticket price I can find is always about $40 above today's date on your 90 day tracker deal? It never seems to be accurate to the prices for that date."
2018,4,Love the app but the constant notifications is very frustrating. I get them even after changing settings. After I  clear all searches and do just one new search I get bombarded with notifications sometimes more than one an hour. Could push me to not use the app which I love
2018,1,"The app continues to request the location, despite i did not use it since a while. Otherwise also no real upside compared to just using the website. Removed it again."
2018,5,Have booked several flights to Europe and across the US with this app. As well as good emergency same day flights out of town before.  It has never let me down.  Idk about hotels.
2018,2,The app and the website always have different flights and different prices with the website usually having cheaper flights. Even after resetting the whole app.
2018,5,Found a pretty  cheap ticket to Australia. ($490 one way from the midwest) The app is super easy to use and sometimes has cheaper rates than the regular website.
2018,5,I always use this to check flights. Always. Prices are amazing.
2018,5,Amazing app indeed. Helped me a lot of times :) Good job!
2018,5,Really easy to use and the filters really help narrow down the flights to find the best one for you.
2018,5,"Beautifully designed app that is also functional, a rarity!"

I got message asking to call a number to see the status of my transaction (btw for booking I used eeb UI), and I had to call the number on next day to read my trasaction failed . Havent got any text or email on the status of transactio - its funny😥"
2018,5,"Please add a ""return to the same airport"" button to filters. It would help when you search trips from nearby airports and plan to drive your own car to the airport."
2018,5,Very user friendly. It returns a maximum number of flights with good filter options to help narrow down the choices
2018,5,Simplicity and speed in the use of the site really helped me make sound travel decisions. KAYAK rocks!

2018,4,"Need handicap choices.. otherwise it's excellent.   Got to Hong Kong, had trouble finding the connecting flight because it was difficult to read their signs. However, the app posted the gates and had a timer for the next flight."
2018,2,"App is very slow when pulling up search results, and no it's not the internet speed. Very annoying when you're trying to do multiple searches and half the time is spent waiting for results to load. Uninstalling."
2018,5,"What sets this app apart from the others is that you can search for round trip fares to anywhere from your location so you can kind of see where and how much ""bang you can get for your buck"""
2018,4,"Pretty good, the best and more reliable out of all apps I tried,  TripIt, TripCase etc. Could use the option of saving documents somewhere within the app though."
2018,4,Love to check flights here. And compare pricing. It's good enough for me.
2018,2,Very glitchy. Have been a user for years but now looking for a new flights app.

2018,5,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
2018,5,This app is amazing!!!!
2018,1,"This is malware. Unwanted popup ads started appearing on top of other apps even when Kayak was not running. Finally found and fixed this issue by uninstalling Kayak. I can't believe it. I was a loyal customer, too. Not only will I never use this app again, I will never use Kayak or Priceline ever again to book travel."
2018,5,"Easy, snappy user interface and finds the lowest prices. One thing missing though, is that you can't lock (select) just one part of a round trip, then search for a return trip that combines to the quoted price. People have said that Skyscanner and others are better, but I haven't seen anything to back those claims yet. Still haven't been able to find anything that gets cheaper fights than Kayak and Google Flights."
2018,5,"Very easy to use! The explore feature is how I've gotten great prices on multiple trips. The filters work great, setting price watches is simple and effective too. Great app."
2017,4,"Choose a seat through them, however if the airlines doesn't confirm it as well you will not get the seat you chose. They also don't tell you if this happens, you would have to notice it yourself on the actual airlines ticket site. Use this app to research then go buy it through the airline instead"
2018,5,My go-to app for travel planning. Always.  So easy to use and the prices are awesome.  Keep up the great work!
2018,5,Great app! Really helps me to find a good deal and easy to figure it out. My fave app!!
2018,4,Cool app to use for looking up flights. Usually I use the website version. I like this app because its on the go.
2018,5,What a wonderful tool. Basically brings everything you need to one place. Super cool.
2017,3,This application its like 3 in one ( tkt-hotel - rent car) and you can search about flight status
2017,5,It gives the best price for a flight and also while checking in the status of an upcoming flight it gives full details along with the terminal gate no. Which is a helpful tips!
2017,5,"Well designed, everything is intuitive. The flight search feature is great, as well as managing my trips."
2018,4,"Love the app, my only frustration is that often when I'm looking in the ""explore"" option and find a good price, when I go to look at the details the cost is much higher."
2018,2,Still showing wrong information after flight update on a trip that's been booked.
2018,5,Great for ideas. Make sure you verify account so can use other features
2018,3,No ability to have settings. Must change manually with every new flight.
2018,5,"Fantastic app at finding the cheapest flights. Fast, simple, and painless"
2018,5,This app is great. Designed well and making booking a flight so easy.
2018,5,Amazing flight booking app. A must have for frequent travellers.
2018,1,Why enter travel dates if it throws them out the window when you try to look at flights?
2018,5,the easy-to-use app contains excellent info and prices
2018,4,"It's nice to not have to access the website, however not all room choices are available when booking."
2018,4,Would be great if explore flights could filter by custom dates like the website.
2017,5,Great DEALS finder! Money Saver!

2018,5,My go to app for all my travels!
2018,5,Does the thing it is for.
2017,5,Go to travel app
2018,5,Cheapest app
2017,3,Used to be on the flight status page you could see what status of the aircraft inbound was in.  Like location and ETA which made it easier to judge How late your flight would be and other things like when you needed to he at your gate.  I don't see that extremely useful feature anymore.  Anybody know an app that still has it?
2017,2,"I use Kayak to double check fares with other, more thorough apps, or to find metadata for other searches. Typically Kayak airfares are double or triple what I can locate elsewhere. Kayak is not for finding good prices, but is a good place to get information for searches elsewhere."
2017,5,Helped me to find great prices for an upcoming trip that the other apps didn't. ☺☺☺ I wish I could give it more than 5 stars
2017,2,Recently the search results are highly inaccurate and include reduced results based on filters that aren't identified. Also had a flaw that prevents you from switching to one-way or multi-colored searches.
2017,5,Easy to use. Love the price alerts.  Wish it searched JetBlue and Southwest as well
2017,5,"App is great. Zippy and clean. HOWEVER, you must remove Cheapoair from your algorithm. Bait and switch is their game. They're really terrible."
2017,5,The app is great. It allows me to find the best flights and prices for our family trips.
2017,5,"This app is easy to use. I used it to go to many states and Tokyo, Japan. No issues at all!  It does what it says. I love this app."
2017,5,"Easy, reliable. Use it for all my flights."
2017,5,"Great app, the app finds the cheapest flights and hotel rooms."
2017,5,Fantastic flight aggregator. Love the explore feature
2017,5,Really cool to see actual prices to plan future travel
2017,5,No glitches. Works like it is supposed to work
2017,5,Easy to use. Great for flight searches.
2017,5,This search engine finds you the options the other operators do not come up with in their search results. Very helpful!
2017,4,"I used to be able to filter it so I only got flights with layovers, now I cant"
2017,4,Easy to use. Great App. Love the Hacker Fares..
2017,4,Easy to use pls give more coupon like traveloka

2017,5,The app is easy to use and allows you to easily check which surrounding dates would be the cheapest.
2017,5,Everything I need for a trip in one place it's great.

2017,4,Sometimes the app offers expensive prices or lower that no exist
2017,5,"Comprehensive booking app which offers lots of interesting features (filters, alerts, price forecast, flexible days, etc) in just one search. Information is clearly displayed while all deals are only one click away. Best among its kind!"
2017,5,"Things I like: Quick indicative, competitive pricing, multi-trip flights Things I don't like: No obvious method to create a mulit-city hotel trip"
2017,5,Easy to use app. Best prices. What more do you need.
2017,5,"Saved $1,803 dollars !!! All 7 other apps I loaded were not offering the price I was looking for. Super Excited !!"
2017,5,I love how quick and easy it is.  Nothing feels better than the idea of getting price alerts on future travel.
2017,1,App sucks.  Provides the same hotel rates that all of the other hotel apps provide. Worthless.
2017,5,The ultimate flight tracker. The explore feature is my fav really good in finding places to go
2017,5,Consistent app I have used for a long time. No fuss. No muss
2017,5,The best flight search app ever. It has everything you need and more.
2017,5,"Good tool to look for best prices on flights, very useful!"
2017,1,Load of rubbish having to register just to look at destinations. .prefer trivago

2017,5,جميل جداً
2017,5,شكرا
2017,1,Repeatedly shows you flights with the lowest prices that are not even available. In a span of a month of searching..every time I see the same fare and flight...it gives me an error message. So frustrating.
2017,3,"Really nice app. The flexible dates option is very useful. On the negative side, the watchlist is really poor implemented as it takes forever to load even in high speed connections and the information is cramped"
2017,1,"Apparently I already have an account, don't know the password so do the usual change my password thing and each time it's like ""oops something went wrong"". Such a helpful app"
2017,2,Keeps informing me that my filter has blocked cheaper flights being listed. I have set my filter to show all. And I cannot clear it
2017,4,"Very useful Flight Tracking App. Similar to Google flights, however Kayak has an edge over Google flights of having it's own App for the same."
2017,5,"Just doesn't look modern without Material Design, which has been the standard for more than a year now. And why the huge icon?  I think the wrong scale is being used."
2017,5,Amazing deals all in one place. They are always trying to find new ways to save us money.
2018,1,Bait and switch app flight prices change after you select your flight Junk app just sends you to someone elses website to prices that are out of date
2017,1,"Don't book rental cars on this app, they are cheats.  You will be charged fees you never saw coming."
2017,5,My go to search engine for everything. Plus great way to store trip info.
2017,5,"Great app! Love the platform, and it's very user friendly."
2017,5,"Brilliant, flights especially. Makes Skyscanner look an inferior alternative."
2017,4,They are giving amazing prices. User friendly
2017,5,"More great price, please.. thankyou"
2017,1,It appears to automatically update with no way to prevent it.... I don't like that....
2017,4,"Very nice, but please let me know how to book for kids under 12!"
2017,5,You are going to get the best trip deal with this app
2017,5,I struggle in life trying to make ends meet. But this app helps me dream and enjoy life the way it should be
2017,5,Easy to use. The filters really help to narrow down what you're looking for.
2017,5,Easy to use. I don't know what I'd do without it.
2017,5,If they could add the Amtrak it would be even better!!!
2017,5,So easy to use. And it's fast !
2017,5,Thank you amazing app i have ever use.

2017,5,Just saved 120quid on flights.
2017,5,It works
2017,1,"Thanks for switching the dates in the UI silently, screwing me out of the reservation. Somehow you managed to re-book a car on the same dates as a booking u made last week, despite the trying to make a booking today, for today. A day ruined is always nice. Learn to code."
2017,1,"No use of your a family of five or more. Will only let you search for hotels, apartments or villas for up to four people! Amazingly awful UX. Uninstalled."
2017,5,"I don't know what you did with the app but it's awful and messy to look for flights there!  Also you choose a date to travel, when you choose ""go anywhere"" you simply put the date you want and have cheaper flight! If I want to flight with no date schedule I would do it, but I wanna flight anywhere on that date!"
2017,5,It's so helpful and very useful app. Helps me a lot with The cheapest flight. I would say it's better than sky scanner :-)
2017,5,Pretty good. It's my go to app for travel. I've used it to book 4 or 5 international trips so far. Works great!
2017,4,"Great app for massive variety of flights but even do have search set for results in euro, my price notifications appear in sterling which is annoying as must go into app to see price"
2017,4,"They changed format completely. Why, it escapes me. Worked fine in prior format. Unusable now. Uninstalling."
2017,5,Great for planning and finding cheap flights to anywhere in the world. Good for those who explore on a budget
2017,2,Nice and easy to use design. However the app keeps crashing on pixel XL even after reinstalling
2017,5,Love it prices for planes and hotels easy way to book and get reservations
2017,5,Terrific app. Rates for world travel are a touch away.
2017,5,great handy app... best deals always
2017,5,Just used it to book a trip! Was very easy to use

2017,5,Number one software
2017,5,"Easy to use. Fair and honest in comparing prices, even if they're not the lowest. Planning my dream vacation so far has been easy."
2017,5,Very pleasant experience made booking my flight very easy and found better deals than me and my family could find plus I got confirmation seconds after booking 10/10 I would recommend and will use again
2017,5,Have used this app to purchase plane tickets and hotel rooms. Highly recommended!
2017,5,On Kayak I seemingly ALWAYS find lower priced fares to the locations I wanna travel to.
2017,4,Let's me choose  what i want at my affordable price without having to search all over the place which drives me nuts!
2017,5,"Only used it for flights, but it works brilliantly."
2017,3,More details on the flight numbers on what and when looking to book or Lookin for someone to land

2017,5,Very helpful application for getting most cheap flights and hotel than you so much for KAYAK all team :))
2017,5,Best travel app yet!!!!! I refuse to use any other... thanks Kayak
2017,5,"Easy, simple, and a good tool to look for the best prices on flights."
2017,4,Flight plus hotel option should allow for multiple locations for hotel in a single flight
2017,5,It works perfectly and you can always find the better price
2017,5,Unfortunately the explore functionality does not work properly from the app since it does not allow to choose the departure airport. Please fix it!
2017,5,Great for finding the best deals on flights quickly
2017,5,"After trying to book a flight to los angeles on expedia and orbitz failed, i tried kayak and was finally able to book my flight"
2017,5,App is great for any part of your travel planning

2017,5,Awesome
2017,5,best
2017,5,its cheap and legit website.
2017,4,👌👍
2017,5,User fdiendly
2017,3,The reason I downloaded Kayak was to do Anywhere searches but it's a bit annoying. You have to choose dates before selecting 'Anywhere' as the app loads right away..and then provides the user with various not-so-similar dates even though I chose Exact Dates. So I ended up going back to Google Flights and then to the airline's website to book a flight.
2017,3,"Up until updating to this version (I'd avoided the previous few updates), I've considered the Kayak app to be 4- or 5-star. But, now... no more than 3 stars. We've lost several sorting options. Filters are more cumbersome. The look and feel of the UI is less elegant, more ""clunky."" Search results take up more space on the screen, thus less information is visible at any one time. Please give me a way to revert to a previous version."
2017,3,"This app could very easily be five star, if the app developers would change the selection of the departure and return dates selection calendar.   It seems nearly impossible to select a date range that spans over a Sunday, since app doesn't recognize your touch screen movement from Saturday to Sunday. As soon as you select Sunday, the app thinks you have abandoned your travel plans and want to depart/arrive on Sunday. Annoying!"
2017,5,"The app is beautifully built. Awesome UX. Just talking about the app though. The flights' prices found are not the cheapest. I can find cheaper ones on Skyscanner. Anyways, awesome app!"
2017,4,First time using this site.  Liked that I can save my trips and go back to items saved.  Also like that prices update when you sign in.
2017,3,Explore function is barely useful.  Filters have to be reset every time a change is made; I never want to fly Spirit so I don't want to have to turn it off over and over and over again.
2017,5,Great app!  Suggestion would be for flight check-in reminders be changed from 24 to 48 hours in line with most airlines...
2017,4,Better deals on rental cars would be nice but great for flights!!  App works smoothly and fast!
2017,4,"I have sat in a hotel lobby, got a great deal and than walked over to the desk and checked in."
2017,1,"Not worth it , flights on dodgey sites with hidden charges.. look @  reviews for gotogate"
2017,5,Just started using the app on a colleague's recommendation and it's so helpful. Thanks for it
2017,5,Easy to use and keeps track of my travel. Great app!
2017,4,Clean UI. Info can be buried under drop down menus.
2017,4,"Love the app overall, but While booking a multistop destination I could not find the +/-1-2 days option"
2017,5,Seems to find all possible flight combinations and best prices
2017,4,"Great delas, would like to search on a calendar to realy know the cheapest days to fly"
2017,4,"Still learning the ropes, but i can see this is going to be very handy."
2017,5,Straight forward and easy to use. Always check Kayak first!
2017,5,Fantastic app. Much clearer and easier to follow than rival apps
2017,4,I wish I could just search for deals with no exact dates.
2017,5,"Super accurate, show even gate number of flight and realtime updated in caae of changes"
2017,5,"Prefer Kayak over Skyscanner, hopper etc. Design is sleek, search is clear, and many filters are allowed"
2017,5,"Excellent !!! #1 recommended for major travelers, vacationers, business trips and party animals."
2017,5,"Simple,been using it for years , easy as 123, I'm off to the airport"
2017,5,Everything thing you need is in this app. So convenient.
2017,5,"Go-to App for Flights, Hotels, and Vehicles!"
2017,4,It's a good App and worthy replacement to the website
2017,4,Great App easy to use to find bargains
2017,5,Great viewing fares offered by different companies by comparison.

2017,5,
2017,5,Easy to use and pretty reliable
2017,4,My favorite travel app for sure. The only thing I can think of that they should add is a flight status widget. I really like the flight status feature but you have to open the app to use it. If this had a widget for flight status it would be awesome!
2017,2,Used to use it to track fights.  Now they require access to my Facebook friends list.  Why?  I'll go elsewhere.  Uninstall time....
2017,4,"Great for searching flights.  Doesn't remember filters, though, so you have to re-enter every search."
2017,5,"Love booking my flights on here! So fast and easy, and they have great deals"
2017,5,I love this apps... is everything you need when you want to trip for vacation!!!
2017,5,Easy to use! Quick and accurate results with great deals.
2017,4,It's a useful aplication just sometime the redirections pages are no allowed to book tickets...
2017,4,Good and Friendly. Thanks
2017,5,I love this app. It is my one stop solution for any airticket bookings
2017,3,Pushes to buy now and not wait for best price.
2017,5,"Easy to use and purchase flights, love the flight info that's available"
2017,5,I have used this app for many years.  It is very reliable.
2017,5,By far the best app to find travel deals!
2017,4,Show lowest price for flights please
2017,5,Great price...keep Us Happy
2017,5,The connect inbox feature is so good!

2017,5,Awesome
2017,2,Does not list all flights. For example SIN-ILO. This route has direct nonstop flights (3hr 40mins). But the kayak app doesn't show them. It only shows the longer one-stop flights. Which result in a journey time that can exceed 15hrs.
2017,5,"Best app to get best flight ticket. I had been using this app 4 year ago, and always, but always, get cheaper and convenience prices with it for my home and international flights.   Simple and friendly software. 100% recommended."
2017,5,"Always gives me good prices. Unhappy with sudden changes in price, but I think that's the hotels catch. Still find great deals"
2017,2,When I try to use the explore feature it uses Boston as my home location; I am in San Diego. It doesn't have the option to change your home location.
2017,1,"Additional flight details eg. meals provided, wifi etc seem to have gone missing! Pls fix it."
2017,5,"I use this app every day, whether or not I'm actually traveling. Definitely a great way to choose an inexpensive hotel, flight, or car"
2017,5,"Easy to navigate through and comes in handy when you've missed your flight and need to book another one, you've got all the prices in one!"
2017,5,AmaaZzing! Love the EXPLORE feature! Gives you soooo many advantages if you want to just go away short notice or plan a trip!
2017,2,I look for cheaper hotel offers on Google then on this app. I just look up hotel near me and better offers. With better flights
2017,5,This app has some nice features others don't I.e exploring the globe for applicable tickets. Plus they sponsor f1
2017,4,"Just using it for the flight function so far, but simple interface and consistent results are very appealing!"
2017,2,I thought this was the best but not anymore  :(..for example American airlines show up for a second the tickets and then disappeared. ..why!!!..fix that
2017,5,User friendly application and great deals on air tickets. Cheaper than others.
2017,5,Great app! It's my go-tp app for cheap travel deals.
2017,5,"Easy to use, simple travel planning app with good price online."
2017,5,This is a great app.  I like the email notifications about price changes and availability.
2017,4,Well is good but the problem is I can sing in whit any email whit any password so it's a big deal
2017,5,Works well. A lot of useful info
2017,5,easy to use.  lovely UI
2017,5,"Very quick and smart app, gound to bevery useful for flying travel..."

2017,5,Go to app for my many trips.
2017,5,🔥🔥!
2017,5,Daily browse for me
2017,5,Lots of choices
2017,1,"Wonderfully designed app with a very intuitive interface that's quicker than all the others. But none of that counts for anything if the app fails to load the booking/payment step.   I spent days researching and when I was finally ready not a single one of my choices would load. I keep getting a time-out error and when I try from my laptop, none of the options i had my eye on are available; none of the prices match the app's choices!  It seems I'm going to pay premium price for an awfully long connection of flights after having spent my day trying to get to the booking window of flight after flight, any flight!  Kayak has failed me in THE worst possible way!"
2017,4,"It's a good app for booking flights and hotels etc. but it's really confusing with departures, it said ""etihad flight to Shetland"" and China Southern to Amsterdam and delta to Amsterdam, all from Edinburgh which you can fly to those locations but not with those airlines and that's the really confusing bit."
2017,5,"Used it to find some great car rental deals in Europe. Really good at finding the cheapest prices, but make sure to play around with the dates and places to get the best deals!"
2017,3,Let down by lack of aircraft type displayed in flight details. This info is provided in desktop version.  Hi
2018,5,"This is a fantastic app which makes my travels and trips much more easier 
and managable. Special thank you to the diligent team behind it."
2017,5,Best app in the whole entire world would recommend to anyone wanting to get the lowest price possible for their trip.
2017,3,"I like this app but it freezes after I have filtered the results. Then,  I have to shut down the app and start my search all over again"
2017,1,app freezes up. overwrites itself wont scroll. generally a mess
2017,4,"The best app in terms of prices, only one but: it shows cheapest ticket for a couple of seconds and then this ticket disappears..."
2017,5,Excellent app to check daily deals on flights.Easy to use.Loved it.
2017,5,Easy to use. Makes life easier. Love this app.
2017,4,"Great at finding flight deals, or at the very least redirecting to other sites that do"
2017,4,Its nice site to work on whatever your travel plans get done
2017,5,Why in one way search we cannot select anywhere as destination. This is a bug need to be improved.
2017,5,"simply the worst app is the Kayak app, hence i want you to use the ixigo app"
2017,5,Plz give me India customers care number kayak Site
2017,5,Surprisingly fast results turn around for a search! 🖒🖒
2017,5,"Easy to use, can save someone a lot of many"
2017,5,Best prices I've ever been able to find
2017,5,Excellent for planning and keeping track of complex and busy schedules

2017,5,Great
2017,5,Efficient
2017,5,Great
2017,5,This app should include all the flights
2017,5,Nandito na lahat
2017,5,"Love this app! Great flight search features to plan multi city itineraries.  The best filtering features compared to other flight search apps. Now you can even ""explore"" to find flights in a certain month that fit a budget and travel duration - in case you need ideas for a holiday. My most used feature however is to filter by airline group (like oneworld). I also love it's ""my trips"" feature where you just email flight or hotel reservation and it logs it in a travel diary/itenerary feature."
2017,2,"App for pedestrians. Serious people, avoid! Again new UI -1. No life filling of search results, no progress indicator -- archaic wait screen instead. Search button looks like right arrow. Why? "" making things faster and better"" usually means making things slower and worse. ""Bug fixes and improvements"" and ""all day, every day"" are not explained. I do not upgrade, because I do not understand consequences. -1."
2017,5,"Absolutely love the app. Finally one that i dont have to put where i am going to. Just put where from, when and how much you would like to spend thats it. It instantly shows places around world that meet your needs. Thank you very much guys. Great job!"
2017,1,"Tried to book an hotel, got error message asking to try again.  Tried again same error.  Then went to another aggregating site and got same hotel same price.  HOWEVER in spite of the error message KAYAK booked the hotel and  charged me.  They denied any refund.  BEWARE!"
2017,5,"Literally 10 minutes after installing Kayak I now have my flight booked and paid for, and it was $200+ less. Oh, and the time works better than the options I was getting with everyone else! (google flights, Expedia, flight network, etc)"
2017,1,"I can't even view airfares in this app. I want to start my research with this, and it always tells me no flights available, even on a common route like ORD to LAX."
2017,5,Absolutely love it. Interface is really easy to navigate. Really quick. And plenty of options on flights. Integrated really well when booking with British Airways. Can't fault it!
2017,5,I use it for flights and car rental. Love it. Haven't used it as much for hotels but need to do this more because it is so good.
2017,4,"The app is great, but if you look at flights or god forbid *save a trip,* you will continue to get spammed with emails to book the trip even after you remove the flight from your saved flights."
2017,1,This app guaranteed me a price of approximately $400 on a Budget Rent a Car turns out the price was approximately $800 needless to say except my budget back on the trip it was not appreciated I will never booked through the site again or with Budget Rent a Car
2017,4,This works well on my android and for my laptop I use the website.  Is there any chance this can be ported to Chrome for my Laptop?  Or is this a redundant feature?
2017,5,The app allows for a good insight into what is out there to choose from with indicative prices. Very user friendly on your android phone.
2017,5,Sleek design. Nice interface. All the shizzle you need
2017,4,"its great, i just dont like the date of birth input option...i can never figure it out and its a pain when you have 5 passengers and you have to go back to your dob from todays date on the calendar"
2017,5,Very user friendly and helpful for comparing flight info and prices.
2017,5,Easy to use. Let's me check prices with ease.
2017,4,Need to show hotels on a map not just lists   to choose best locations.
2017,5,"Good app, i use it all the time for searching flights and finding the best prices"
2017,5,Flight selecting option like the desktop version should be made avaliable.
2017,2,Not sure if it is a good app. Someone is pulling the wool over my eyes.
2017,5,Also love the trip tracking feature with real time tracking of flights
2017,5,Great comparison tool. Love hacker fares.
2017,1,Can't even sign in or look for flights after they added mandatory login.
2017,1,Setting up the app goes round and round. Completely useless.
2017,5,Great app for keeping everything organized in one place that's easy to access!
2017,5,App looks and feels great. Straight forward and makes it easy.
2017,4,Love to see all my options on one site
2017,5,Very easy to use and the sliding scale for times and date makes it an awesome app good job guys.
2017,5,Great app that helps me find good inexpensive flight tickets
2017,5,Easy and very convenient. Recommend any day anytime.
2017,5,Always find the lowest fares no matter what I am comparing against.
2017,5,Love this!!! So cheap!! Getting ready to book soon!
2017,4,Love the app. Easy to use
2017,3,Where is function when kayak notify when have cheapest ticket between dates or months?
2017,5,Nice application. Very clean and reliable.
2017,5,Easy to use while looking up prices
2017,4,Good App just starting using  it
2017,5,So convenient for comparing flights from day to day.
2017,5,Won't be able to travel anywhere if it wasn't for kayak
2018,4,Useful and easy to use

2017,5,The app for travellers
2017,1,Needed a hotel in Orlando. I said your card will not be charge until your stay. I booked the hotel thru Kayak and was redirected to Getaroom. My card was charged but received no confirmation number for my reservation. Called Getaroom and was told i got no reservation but i told them you charged my credit card. Was told called my Bank they did not received any money. Called my bank and yes they got my money. Now i have to wait 10 days and dispute the charges. Stay away from Kayak this people need to block Getaroom.
2017,4,"The app is great, but some of its parts do not accessible for visually impaired especially when they want to select date and month during booking. It neither works with Google TalkBack Norwood voice assistance off accessibility. Please pay attention to it."
2017,1,"Downloaded this to see if it'd show me deals Google wasn't and sure enough it had cheap listings, however when I tried to book them I was only brought to the hotel's website where it said no reservations available. Waste of my time."
2017,1,Very untrustfull app. Uses 3rd party (like one travel) that are telling you that the reservation was confirmed  and call u the next day to say the airline cant issue ticket so you need to buy a new expensive one . Sounds like scam
2017,1,Lately the whole app or website is giving horrible services and fake prices. I contacted support and they said just to refresh the page but it never fixed the issue. False advertisement!!!!
2017,1,Do not buy through this apps. Just use this to search and go directly reserve from the hotel website. They charged 30 dollar more than the hotel price.
2017,5,"The app is fast, convenient, and you can set up trip alerts for prices that are below what you are looking for. I love it's speed."
2018,1,Ever since the in-stream/in-feed ads started the app slows to a crawl and resets to earlier in the scroll causing me to have to scroll back down and get hit by an ad again. Vicious cycle
2017,5,"It's very easy to use. Unlike other apps, while doing the booking we don't have to be baffled by local language & many other tiny clauses that might have escaped our attention."
2017,1,Horrible experience. Not able to select dates for multi city. New UI is very confusing.
2017,2,The flight tracker features doesn't work. There is always an internet error...
2017,5,Awesome app for cheap flight fairs. Loved it. 🖒
2017,5,Started to use this app few days bak. Very user friendly and up-to-date.
2017,1,"Doesn't let me search. It always says, ""search failed, try again later."" Useless."
2017,5,"Great search options, also best prices. Use it mainly for flights."
2017,5,Very useful app. Can be used to keep the trips organised.
2017,5,I love that the trip tracker updates with changes to your trip with such ease and speed.
2017,5,Love this app! Great for planning trips.
2017,5,Great for quick travel changes and works well anywhere in the world
2017,5,"Love it, young traveler, and business owner. App made traveling tension easy on me"
2017,4,it will be wonderful to have luggage fare information as well
2017,5,Super easy app and always updating so you gotta move fast on good deals!!!
2017,5,"Easy to use app...use it on the average of twice a week,  every week for over 2 years now."
2017,5,I love the push notifications for price drops and also the option to explore destinations and filter base on budget
2017,5,"Good app. Easy flexiblity, lots of filtering."
2017,5,Great site that checks more companies for the best deals than Expedia does.
2017,5,Just getting used to it but it looks and seems very good indeed.
2017,5,"Good App, worth every single MB of space on your Mobile"
2017,5,Very cool features like seeing where you can fly on a budget.

2017,5,thanks
2017,2,"Don't book through Amoma! My booking was made and charged, but when i called for my confirmation i was told the rooms were all booked. Due to an unknown error during my booking i would not be able to stay at the hotel i was charged for and will have to wait up to 15 days to have my funds rerurned! No help from kayak customer service either!"
2017,5,I've used kayak exclusively for the last 2 years for all my flights and hotels.  I haven't had a single negative issue with any of my bookings or flights.  Great customer service.
2017,3,"I keep getting fares that do not exist which throws off my results. When I contacted customer service ok the concern they seem to blow me off an chalked it up to ""constantly changing fares."""
2017,5,"This is a great price search and comparing engine, with a simple and immediate interface and a lot of accuracy in the quotations delivered! Even the visual geographical search feature is innovative and well done: gives first glance the best options simply wandering on the map!"
2017,5,Very helpful app for planning vacation trips. It compares prices against all the popular services and provides reasonable options. I just love this app and would recommend to all looking for planning their vacation trip.
2017,5,Super easy to use. Even had a price alert update while I was on app which allowed me to select an even cheaper flight! Will use it again. 👍
2017,3,Could be so much better. Very annoying to have to go to airline sites with no mobile version in-app
2017,5,I have been using Kayak since it was Side Step. This is the best flight / travel search engine to date. I love this app.
2017,5,Its always my go to. Flew my Dad from Tampa to Houston round trip for $169 when all the others wanted $200+. Love it!!
2017,4,Super easy to use. Probably makes it too easy to day dream about trips and make it happen with a quick submit button.
2017,1,"Outsourcing development is never a good idea. Idiots. Every little thing, makes me have to reenter information."
2017,4,"App is great, but I would like to have control over the before/ after option for flexible dates (be flexible in just one direction)."
2017,1,"New app changes make it pretty worthless to check your alerts, oops I mean watchlist now which won't update nor pull up results."
2017,5,"Fantastic app! Really helps me plan for plane, hotel and rental car! Luv it!"
2017,5,So easy to use and the filters are great especially when flying over seas. Last thing you want is to book tickets and find out your not arriving when you thought you would be (time zones).
2020,2,"Antigamente era o melhor sítio de pesquisa de preços de passagens aéreas, mas desde o fim do ano passado os preços mostrados eram beeeem diferentes dos que as companhias ofereciam, eu precisei pesquisar companhia por companhia para ter os valores reais. Desisti do Kayak."
2017,5,"So easy to use, and its fast. Not to mention the slogan of one and done is so true, best rates possible from a highly experienced traveler!"
2017,5,"Quick, easy, intuitive.  Excellent features, fare tracker, and trip builder."
2017,4,Great app but a search option to keep spirit airline off the ticket option would be great. I don't mind spending more for a decent airline
2017,5,Great little app. Used it while travelling on the east coast of Canada for lodging.  Use free wifi at Timmy's and McDonald's.
2017,4,Great to have kayak in your pocket but it has a difficult time accessing the other sites so you can purchase tickets.
2017,5,Really good app... it is letting me the price that I want to know.
2017,5,Love this app! I can always find awesome deals.
2017,4,Great app for travel planning. One of the best.

2017,5,I love Kayak. It helps me to manage my trip.
2017,5,Very intuituve and easy to use. The alerts are great and the interface is uncluttered.
2017,4,everything is good just that the prices are not always the same from the company compared wirth the app
2017,5,"Great app! Only improvement I could suggest is to include the ""explore"" option in the app"
2017,5,Great app for finding best flights at best prices
2017,4,Best travel tool since the Swiss Army Knife.
2017,5,"It's a great app, military friendly too helps the guys here, you bastards did well."

2017,4,"Easy to use, lot of options."

2017,4,Nice to have the comparisons from other sites.
2017,4,Overall it is a good app to manage trips.
2017,3,I wish there was a filter to exclude basic economy
2017,5,New design and even better than before! Wow!
2017,3,Doesn't let you select same-day returns.
2017,5,My only to go app for booking flights 5 Star
2017,5,The alerts rock!  A great time-saver
2017,5,This is a great engine to search your fligth. Congratulations  KAYAK

2017,5,Like the explore feature.
2017,5,Super buena...!
2017,5,Use it everytime I travel.
2017,5,Kayak is the only way to fly!
2017,5,Found really cheap flights
2017,5,Use this all the time
2017,5,ok
2017,5,Ok
2017,5,Lots of options
2017,1,Use a map to select a hotel. Travelers  do not know local neighborhood names
2017,5,The new update is Amazing. The explore feature is superb.
2017,5,User friendly and best filters to organize travel options
2017,4,"Pretty easy to use, gets better with every update."
2017,4,Not bad but there 's better deals directly on your website
2017,5,"Very easy to use, and shows you exactly what your looking for."
2017,1,"Did not work when I tried to book a car rental.  It booked me for Springfield MA when I wanted Hartford CT.  Had  trouble selecting number of days.  I ended up calling the rental car agency direct to get a car.  And when I tried to cancel the reservation to Springfield MA, I got a message that I need to call Priceline direct.   I gave up. I have used Kayak before, when I had an Apple phone, or from my laptop, and never had a problem, but this past trip, they lost me as a go-to source for booking travel accommodations from my Note 4.    It was a frustrating waste of time."
2017,4,"Great app, easy to use and process. But prices are not always those advertised (waste of time) and very small airlines companies displayed I am not sure I would book into. Otherwise good app."
2017,3,"I would rate it higher if I could have more options for the watch list. I don't particularly like a certain airline. I would enjoy the option to exclude a particular airline from the alert, or to select an alert for a particular airline only. Thanks."
2017,4,"Was much better before the update. Still good but before was 5* now less easy to navigate, slower and results not always reliable. Go back to previous version please!"
2017,5,Missing Mobiata's Flight Track app now that its been shuttered by evil  Expedia?  Look no further than good guy KAYAK.  Almost all the useful features you remember from Flight Track.  A great substitute.
2017,4,"I like this apps, one thing isn't accurate than pruce of chosen fights are not the same in other countries , ex. I searched for a flight from Dublin  to Manil, September 4 and return in October  6, Manila to Dublin, my gf search at Dublin and me at the Philippines"
2017,5,"Kayak searches come up with the best deals.  Even when an airline claims the cheapest flights are booked directly through the airline website, I can still find better deals on Kayak.  I love how it organizes all my trips too."
2017,5,"Great way to compare flights, hotels and cars. Booked hotel in Singapore via the App on my mobile. Nearly booked a flight also but found price beater guarantee on another site. Overall impressed with the functionality."
2017,5,Very smart app. Not used others like it to compare but very happy with it. Keeps all my travel plans in one place and the live updates at the airport are a nice touch
2017,5,It's detailed in information. I love the smart sleek navigation and bug free operation. Work hard to make it's user friendly send the best among  others
2017,1,Warning. Booking through Kayak is deceiving. They use third party companies with bad reputation that mess up with your flights and MONEY!
2017,4,amazing app... i also like flight tracking need to allow price watch by seat class .. business class
2017,5,Ive used Kayak nearly exclusivly for booking flights and they keep getting better at finding the best price or route. 10/10.
2017,5,Great selection and price for flights within Asia (thailand to Japan for eg).. Thanks guys
2017,4,"One of the best travel apps, however, still lacks some of the advanced planning functionality or it's hidden somewhere such that I can't find or use them"
2017,4,Kayak provides some companies to buy tickets with bad reputation that you do not want to deal with it and see that companies with very low price of tickets is very distracting
2017,5,Easy to use.  Good deals on short notice travel. Lots of options.
2017,1,Love kayak but this app is unresponsive. Not sure if it's a bug with the latest build or what. Please fix!
2017,5,My go-to app for arranging my travel... lots of it. It's never failed me.
2017,5,Very easy to set up complicated searches to find the best prices. Love it.
2017,4,"Helpful mobile trip planning, but not necessarily the best prices."
2017,5,Love it.. I got some amazing deals with no hassles.
2017,5,Pretty good prices when buying personal tickets. Easy to use.
2017,4,"Great app for a quick search on flights, hotels and cars"
2017,5,"New interface is well thought out, now prefer the app to the online version"
2017,5,It searches a whole week for the cheapest flight.  Push and e-mail alerts.
2017,5,Favorite travel app. I refer friends to use it all the time.
2017,5,The most convenience and accurate price ratings thank you kayak .
2017,5,This app is Amazing!! Making travel plans are easy using this app!
2017,5,Great way to explore travel options and dream up trips
2017,1,shows me no results for car rental in TLV airport. ridiculous
2017,5,it is convenient to keep track the flight before and during travel
2017,4,"Good app but can't find how to change units, eg ft to m"
2017,5,"Nice application! But can't find how-to switch Fahrenheit to Celsius, help me please."
2017,5,It is always my goto app or website. Better than all others.
2017,5,I love it. I trust the great deals.
2017,5,"I haven't used it that much, but the app makes things much easier that just trying to use Google!"
2017,4,"Header image for playstore page currently reads ""Search hundred travel sites at once"", should be ""Search hundreds of travel sites at once""."
2017,2,Don't like the new look. Please bring back the logos of the companies
2017,5,"A great place to buy, even impulse buy, international round trips."
2017,5,Brilliant app to find cheap flights in your budget I highly recommend it for anybody even think about traveling
2017,5,"Great app, one of the few I use to plan my trips."
2017,5,"I consistently find the best prices in a clear, concise display."
2017,5,"Stress free, deal finding, stream lined app."
2017,5,Funky little app that makes spontaneous trips really easy.
2017,5,You simplified the app recently making it a bit easier to use.
2017,5,I wish BudgetAir site accessible on mobile phones through the app.
2017,5,I have not complain best app ever.
2017,5,Very resourceful app...always on point!
2017,5,"Click it & book it. Anywhere, anytime. What's not to like?"
2017,5,"Good prices, easy to use."
2017,5,I'm enjoying the app so far.
2017,5,This app keep me informed. I love it.
2017,5,Easy to use with great price alerts.

2017,5,great
2017,5,Nice
2017,5,Decent
2017,5,Useful
2017,5,The go-to app for all travel bookings
2017,5,Can always count on Kayak!!
2017,1,Poor user interface
2017,5,"Pasajes economicos, fácil busqueda"
2017,5,My go to app on travel information
2017,5,The World at your fingertips
2017,5,Ok
2017,5,Like it
2017,2,"Used to be my go-to app for plane tickets. It no longer let's me actually purchase tickets in-app! Something is broken, and it renders the app useless."
2017,4,It is a quick app. I am not sure if this app gives you nonstop flights options. Other than that I love it.
2017,3,"Site is just OKAY, could be GREAT, needs work! REVIEW your stay emails do not open link in order to give FEEDBACK, please fix."
2017,4,Great for searching. Wish there were more options for flexible searching. Prices are not always accurate.
2017,5,For flights this is the best app ive seen so far
2017,5,Best price found every time
2017,5,Excellent
2017,5,Save time and money
2017,4,"Before I begin, I would like to say that Kayak has been an excellent and extremely well-designed app... up until now. The recent update moved around everything and hid some pretty basic things (hotel searches, flight categories, etc.) where they should be at the top or in the tab like the old version. The old version was very well thought out and organized. For example tabs at top had flights, hotels, cars and you could click on them and everything was there to utilize. Also I loved the option to eliminate airline alliances and search by individual airline since I prefer a specific airline. I also LOVED the ability to see the TOTAL cost of hotel stays and rental cars since I can see the total amount to help me out with my travel budget. Both features I mentioned are very clearly found in old version (under the options button and then airlines; click on 3 dots in hotel search and price options). I would give a 5 star review if developers included a ""classic"" version of the app. Bring back the old UI and I would use it alot more!!! Kayak can continue to be the best travel app once classic version is brought back!!"
2017,1,One star for kayak's introduction of obnoxious notifications over flights you searched but didn't request monitoring of. This kind of attitude is rude and unacceptable and there isn't even a way to disable it in the app. Get your act together kayak!
2017,2,"Great company and nice app interface, but buggy and won't let me actually book a rental car through the app -- despite multiple attempts and logging out and starting over, I just keep getting a message saying ""prices have changed"" and to re-run the search. Frustrating."
2017,4,"Rather US centric when it comes to booking stuff, for example booked a car in the UK and didn't include taxes that are mandatory that's not the case with many other car booking places... But it is great to see a trip info in one place. This is the reason to use this app for me"
2017,3,A previous version had a spinning cursor to show it was still searching.  Now you can't tell when it's finished.  It can sit for ten seconds and then more results pop up.
2017,1,"Hotel search is horrible, it only allows a search in a 1mile radius... The hotels in the area I searched were booked due to an event in the area, and I couldnt search surrounding cities/towns easily. It was easier to look with Google Maps"
2017,5,"This app is so useful if you are planning a holiday. 5 stars forever  1 thing though is that you cant plan that far ahead (e.g august 2018) , so you cant get the real prices. Apart from that, perfect"
2017,5,Saved me from getting ripped off. I showed up and the hotel told me I had to pay cash up front and they wouldn't refund my deposit for a 7 day stay. Called the 1800 number  a day no questions asked after I told them what happened and they called  to hotel and chewed the out and got me a hotel across town!
2017,2,"Prices are hardly ever accurate. It'll state a deal for a certain price and when you go to book, the redirected site you're buying from will state that the deal is no longer available. Hopper is 1000% better."
2017,4,"App is good for finding cheaper rentals, flights, and hotels. One issue i am having is that it will not let me set up price change reminders right now. Hopefully this is fixed soon."
2017,5,"Keeps repeating that message when I click on My Trips. I am logged in but can't view my trips. Only logging out and logging back in solves the problem, but close the app and there is the error again. Pls fix."
2018,3,"I have been a long term user of Kayak, however the third party reservations 
they are allowing lower massively the quality. After several issued with 
flight and hotel cancellations I am happy to be back to Expedia."
2017,5,This is an easy an efficient way to organize travel. Just forward your email receipts and you're done. The details are added with a link back to the original email if needed. It also integrates with Google Calendar. Very happy with this app.
2017,5,"Great options and fantastic prices. There are flights, airlines and other options here that I could not find on mayor sites such as Expedia or other big sites. Bravo Kayak!"
2017,5,"I love the explore features of this app, it gives me a chance to consider parts of the world that I have not thought of. The one improvement I would like to see in that respect, are air specials from your own departing city, instead of random ones."
2017,5,"As advertised works great except it should find me cheaper flights, hotels, and cars. If it can't find them...then it should create them! 😂"
2017,5,Yay! You guys listened and developed a merge feature. Best update yet. Love this app to manage all my trip details!
2017,5,Super easy way to find the cheapest.  We have saved loads by setting price alerts and being a little patient.  Great new feature
2017,4,App works great. Pretty good functionality compared to desktop experience. Needs more flexible search capabities for deal alerts.
2017,5,I like the info. and choices available so far. Trying to book a multi-stop trip and it's been easy so far.....now if the prices would just go down!
2017,5,I just downloaded the app but it seems like an easy way to save time and money. After I make my first trip I will come back and rate it again.
2017,5,"I travel at least twice a month, great for keeping itinerary in one place...also has been my go to app for last minute car rental..flight cancelled, had car booked by the time I walked to rental counters"
2017,5,I recommend kayak explore to absolutely everyone. It got me roundtrip tickets to both Copenhagen and Bangkok for under $500 each just by paying attention and setting price alerts!
2017,5,"I use this primarily for flights. It is very easy to use. It allows me to compare multiple airlines and dates, and filter the results based on my needs."
2017,5,Snappy and informative interface. A good user experience in general. There are some improvements to be mad but nothing major.
2017,3,"After the last update Kayak got harder to use, example: now it's difficult to hunt down the flight tracker under trips tab while it uses to be on the homepage."
2017,4,"Interface could be little more User friendly, yet it is great to find best prices thru competition."
2017,5,Easy to use features and tools. Simple interface. Quick load times. Great app!
2017,5,Have used Kayak for a while.  Love having the app on my phone now.  Easy to use.
2017,3,Doesn't show youany flights to compare/book packages. Hotel alone is no use
2017,5,I love having this application on my phone. It's easy to use and gives me many options to choose from.
2017,3,"Good for basic, one off price comparisons but alerts feature is temperamental."
2017,5,One of my go to resources when building trips away.  Always easy to navigate and rarely beaten on price
2017,2,"First search and.. Nothing. Missing airport in Lodz, Poland, easily found anywere else.. Disapointing."
2017,5,Awesome way to get the best travel prices! We have used it to travel all over the world.
2017,4,"Mostly used for flights. It is convenient, and the presentation of information makes it easy to use."
2017,3,Easy to use app. Always finding the cheapest prices!
2017,4,Nee user great for multi city planning. Booking reality may differ
2017,5,only need flight right now maybe in the future i will try the car rental and hotel part of the app
2017,5,As easy as it gets for searching for flights. Would be nice to book through kayak though.
2017,5,The confidence scale is very helpful. I like that I can search using flexible dates. Good app!
2018,2,"It's easy to use however using other apps and comparing them, I've found 
cheaper air fare. However, it's a good app"
2017,5,Alsays book my trips on here. Its the best and super easy to use.
2017,5,Nice app.. Useful features for comparing flights.
2017,4,Kayak is a perfect app to find flights for cheap price and compare prices.
2017,5,Prices shown are not correct. You need to be honest with us.
2017,4,"I love the kayak website. The app has crashed on me a couple of times, so I'm not giving it 5 stars"
2017,5,Explore option is my favorite tool to figure out where I'm going to travel to next.
2017,5,It will give you the most updated seat sales ticket and it will inform you the cheapest airlines available fast and realiable transaction..a most try and recommended for everyone 😉
2017,5,Have always loved kayak and still use it but not happy that for Spirit flights it sends you too CheapTickets which charges you MORE than if you booked directly with Sprit
2017,5,Great app. I use it all the time for booking my flight.
2017,5,Only app I use to make flight and car reservations. Highly recommend it
2017,5,Fast and great for comparison. Simple layout and easy navigation.
2017,5,Been using for 3 years and really like the price alert feature
2017,5,"Good coordination among hotels, flights and rental cars."
2017,4,Hopefully a FLIGHT TRACKING widget is coming soon.
2017,1,Can't do anything without linking some big data or social media account? What happened to privacy
2017,5,Makes it so essy to find the best flights and prices.
2017,5,Love all the filters. And the price is always the best.
2017,5,Planning a trip to Catalina made easy thanks to KAYAK

2017,1,Just another bullshit site with the same protocol as any other
2017,5,It's superb!  I won't use any other.
2017,5,It reminds u at the right time n doesn't annoy u it's just right.

2017,5,&lt;3
2017,5,Love the interface and simplicity. It just works and I love the impartial flight price comparison that you don't get using something like Google.
2017,5,"Very good reference. Was at a Flight Centre and on the spot I checked the prices on Kayak in parallel with what the Flight Centre asked, and thanks to Kayak I knew Flight Centre was asking too much."
2017,4,Easy to use and set up alarms but several times can only be used as a reference since when you are referred to the airline Web page the price changes
2017,5,"Great work! Excellent UI, good travel deals."
2017,5,"Very user friendly, love setting the filters and alerts and letting the app find flights for me!!"
2017,5,I love Kayak! It allows you to set up flight price alerts which is awesome!
2017,5,Works great! But now i don't see the aircraft type anymore!
2017,2,"app likes to notify me of prices alerts, only to error about not being able to fetch alerts when the program has been opened."
2017,5,I have used this app. on several occasions and have enjoyed the ease of purchasing my airline tickets.   Great job Kayak!
2017,5,Used many times over the years. It's my goto app for flights.
2017,4,Just forward your booking details and it builds one itinerary with everything you need to know
2017,4,Its a good site..easy and friendly to navigate
2017,5,Love it...wish you could search from multiple airports to your destination all at once.
2017,5,I love this app for planning my trips all over the world!
2017,5,Does what it should and it's easy to use. Worthy of downloading.
2017,1,It is so bad. Interface is bad

2017,5,I use it for finding my flights in the USA and Europe.
2017,5,I think it helps when u need it before the last minute
2017,5,Wish all airlines could be included!
2017,5,It works and that's all I need!
2017,5,I always search flights on this apo
2017,2,"No Keyword Search??  Every travel app I've has the ability to conduct a keyword search for hotel names, etc. With this app, you can only define location and dates. I was looking for a specific hotel but had to go through 30÷ to find what I was looking for."
2017,3,They removed the ability to set an alert for a specific date. Huge mistake. I used to like the app before they did that.
2017,5,A great app for booking flights and hotels!!
2017,5,Keep up The Good Work ....espect better deals
2017,4,Easy to use anytime.
2017,5,Wishes to be better than wego
2017,5,Great for flights review and booking
2017,5,Best app ever for flight booking
2017,5,Excellent
2017,5,I try to plan my trips in advance mostly and Kayak allows me to save a trip configuration and watchtower ticket fares over time. Even when shopping for a last minute ticket due to change of plans Kayak is awesome. Prices represented are the same when actually booking the tickets. Thanks Kayak for making my booking experience easy and tracking the stages of a multi-city trip.
2017,5,"Kayak has become my 'go-to' app for everything and everything related to travel. Great tool for searching air fares, hotel deals  - and it does the comparison shopping for you! Definitely would recommend it."
2017,5,"""Bravo"" to the creators of this app!  I wish I'd found it before I booked my Atlanta trip but I will definitely be using this app for every trip in the future!  Easy to use, multiple choices on everything!   I love it!  Great job guys!"
2017,5,"Love the App.  However, I noticed that Southwest is not in the list of airlines for comparing prices.  I recently started using it because it allows you to carry two luggage free for each ticket.  That makes it cheaper than most of the airlines."
2017,4,"I recently started using Kayak to manage my trips, instead of TripIt. Although TripIt has more functionality, Kayak has a much more enjoyable UX.  Would love to see more features added, would even be willing to pay for them."
2017,3,How long does it take for an order to process I purchased a flight and I haven't gotten a confirmation email and I don't know own how to find my purchased flights on the app. What am I missing?
2017,5,Very user friendly. It has good prices. I've already bought 2 flights from australia to southamerica using kayak. Defenitely I'll keep using it!
2017,5,"Great Prices for flights! I am not sumo sure about the hotels though, I only use this app for airfare prices and trying to figure out the best time to buy tickets."

2017,4,Only bug I've found is bookmarking flights. I only use this app for flying and it works great.

2017,5,"Has amazing deals and u can plan your entire trip with kayak. Flight, hotel and renting cars. Lets yiu filter to fit yiur exact budget. You can enter the nights you are staying and find out the TOTAL COSTS."
2017,5,"Kayak is relatively easy to navigate with minimal hassle and no hidden surprises.  I'm using it today, for the 4th time this year.  I have confidence that this trip will go smoothly as well - thanks, kayak!"
2017,1,I want to search for flights and it won't let me change the departure airport from current location. So I can't search for flights like I can on the website. Useless
2017,5,Absolutely awesome app! Gonna save me a ton of money planning my next trips. Very easy to use as well.
2017,5,"So far I've only used this app to keep track of flights. In my case, it's been great"
2017,5,Fantastic app for air fares. So easy to view and compare. Especially like the Hacker Price feature
2017,5,Great app with a great interface. Not sure if there's a better one because I've never needed to look.
2017,5,Easy to find your way around.  Love the pop up notices when it finds a cheaper price than previously quoted.
2017,5,Explore feature let's you find cheapest flights out of any airport- perfect for creating adventures
2017,5,I've tried various different flight price apps and find this to have the most powerful and easy to use interface and it returns the best deals
2017,5,Superior trip planner to paid apps like Tripit. My go to for travels and adding pictures of the city is a nice touch
2017,5,"I always use Kayak as my first ""go-to"" when I research airfares. You can make the search as broad or narrow as you need to get a good view of pricing and schedules."
2017,2,It used to be great but the prices don't match what's listed. Data is inaccurate.
2017,5,Easy to use. Helps identify best price and flight options.
2017,4,"I mean it gives me the info that I need to make a decision...HOWEVER, I would like if it would give me full access to Southwest airlines..."
2017,5,Have used it for years. Still my favorite travel app.

2017,5,Consistently the cheapest flights available. Keeps improving.

2017,4,Usually get better hotel prices through LMT Club.
2017,5,Great all in one app to plan a trip. First go to for me to plan a trip
2017,5,Aimed more at North American users than European ones EDIT: seems better now with European budgeg airlines in there
2017,5,Works great! Fast searches
2017,2,There is nothing more special thanks other websites
2017,4,My alltime favorite flight booking app.
2017,4,"How do I make payment, I don't have any credit card or visa mastercard."

2017,5,Kayak is where i go for all my trips!!
2017,5,Used it often on all platforms
2017,5,Number 1
2017,5,"I love the ""Explore"" feature. You set a timeframe and a dollar amount and it'll tell you everywhere you can fly to.  It opens up vacation opportunities to places I'd never think to go."
2017,5,Been booking international travel for several years and Kayak is my main go to page for searching flights.  Love it!
2017,5,I love to travel and kayak really does make it easy to find the best deals !
2017,1,I've been trying to book a flight from McCarran to MCI FOR AN hour get off your coffee break and assess and help!
2017,5,Quick.good. add option to check nonstop before run search
2017,4,Too soon to tell just started but like what I see so far
2017,5,Found fantastic rates on flights from USA to Thailand
2017,5,Great app!
2017,5,This app is very user friendly.
2017,5,Best travel app
2017,5,Awesome!
2017,5,Love it!
2017,5,Great
2017,4,"Great app, even the portals to different sites are good!"
2017,5,Excelente!!!
2017,3,"Nothing special. Nice UI, but I'm more upset with the deceptive advertising. It's supposed to tell you when the best time to buy is, and screen shots display ""Confidence"" scores, but those didn't show up for my searches and I see no settings to turn it on.  If it's in there, then I take back what I said about a good UI! In the end, same prices and flights I have found on the other big travel search engines online. Don't waste your time."
2017,3,"It's a great app for booking trips and easy to use. I've used it several times to book flights. The only major complaint I have is that it sends you several emails about trips that you've looked up. It will keep sending you the price alerts and it's super annoying. If I want to book a flight I will go on there and do it, I don't need an email every day to remind me. I turned the notification off and I still receive emails. My inbox is full enough and I don't want them emailing me every day!"
2017,2,"flight search is broken in both app and website since a couple of months ago. Many better and cheaper flights are not shown from solid airlines. For example, I searched for flights from SF to Munich. The app showed me while updating the results good flights from Lufthansa and then those results disappeared and I saw only the hack fares at that price range. Tried multiple times and similar results. Tried other flights from Munich a few weeks later, and still same phenomenon (LOT flights disappeared). I was able to find and book those flights on the respective airlines websites. I frequently and was able to verify this break in behavior 6-7 times."
2017,3,"I keep getting the error message ""alert not created. You already have an alert with the criteria you specified."" But it is old alert criteria that I want to use again. I deleted the alert previously because my trip was cancelled but now I am trying to go again and it will not let me use the same criteria to create a new alert. This is really frustrating because I don't currently have an alert that is visible for this but it keeps telling me I do!"
2017,4,Unable to delete old prices alerts and unable to create new alerts. I really like this app but have not been using due to these glitches. And you use to be able to see a graph of how the the prices has changed over 5he month but I can't seem to fins it anymore.
2017,5,"I haven't had many issues, the bugs i had since i first reviewed are pretty much gone. I love this app  i use kayak for all my travel, i love their matrix on their website and it's super easy to search and book. I'll be booking my next trip shortly!"
2017,3,"Nice app, however editing multi-line or even just long notes for trips isn't feasible as the field is just a single-line textbox. Please fix this! Also, the textarea for editing notes inline on the website should be resizable and preferably should autosize to the content."
2017,5,Dude. So I'm planing several trips and not only does this app help me look at cheap hotels flights and rental cars but the thing I love the most is that I can use the explore button to potential research prices and best times to go. All I need now is to save up that money!
2017,1,"Searched for multiple international flights, the app states that the prices include all taxes, once you select a flight you get a different price, more than twice as big. Nicely executed app, but useless."
2017,5,Love this app! I've been using it for years and couldn't be happier. I especially love to use it to organize my trips and keep all my reservations in one place.
2017,3,"So the latest update has taken away the total flight time. Developer, can you put it back because that is one of the key things I look at when searching for flights."
2017,4,"It's a nice search engine that allows for more flexibility compared to its main competitor, Sky Scanner. Overall, it's good though not as intuitive as their web version."
2017,5,"The most feature-packed app/website for finding flights by far. Have not used their hotel search feature so cant comment on that, but after trying out more than 10 apps to find flights, i have settled on Kayak."
2017,5,"Often ""My Trips"" will say ""You haven't started tracking any trips yet. Forward airline, hotel, car rental ..."". Refreshing doesn't help. I have to sign out and re sign-in. Rather frustrating the tool is useful when off-line. Friends with the apple version don't seem to have this problem."
2017,5,Kayak is fantastic! Great deals. Haven't booked yet but will update review once we take trip!
2017,4,"Works well, decent interface and filters, a few times I've checked other sites I didn't find cheaper dates so kayak gets the job done."
2017,3,Well job but the app thinks for no reason I'm at Boston and I I've in Mexico city. There should be a section in settings to set your current location :(
2017,5,"Nice interface. Very easy to use and it's really gives you the best price for flight tickets hotels and cars, even though I always also check Trivago for hotels."
2017,2,"I use this app all the time, but lately every time I want to book, the flight is no longer available or prices have changed.  You keep your prices updated!!!"
2017,4,"Almost perfect - if it had an Android widget which showed me trip itineraries like the Tripit app, I'd switch in a heartbeat."
2017,5,Easy to use. Only problem you cannot book flights only reserve. Still needs to go to your computer to book.
2017,4,This app has been very helpful when I want to price search on flights or hotels. If your dates are flexible it even more convenient.
2017,5,This app is awesome! Was looking for a week getaway that won't break my wallet with my boyfriend and found some really great deals I couldn't find online!
2017,1,Prices dont match up.  If u select a flight... takes u to another screen... prices emd up being more then stated
2017,4,"It's great, but the Website is a better experience. It would be phenomenal if we could have +/- days option in multi-city bookings also"
2017,5,I use kayak to plan all my trips and have never had a problem. Been using them for 5+ years for multiple domestic and international flights.
2017,3,Great for searching flights but doesn't have all the information as searching expedia or travelocity. Easy to compare flights in one app.
2017,5,Very convenient.You don't need to visit travel agency for your travel and more it's 50% higher the price.
2017,5,Good app if you are planning a trip but don't have time to continuously look for the best deals.
2017,5,Always reliable and always love the algorithm of find price pairs of flights not foubd on other sites. Always my first app xhoixe when travel planning.
2017,5,So easy to use. Always helps me find the best deal and automatically puts together my itineraries.
2017,1,They don't find the cheapest flights. Was able to find the same flight on another site for half the price this app found.
2017,4,"It is a great trip app, help so much to comparative differents air ticket options, hotels and more, I like it"
2017,5,When ever I get confused about connecting flights this is the first  option I search.. Loved the algorithm they made kudos to team
2017,5,Booked South Africa trip... Cheap round trip! With a little work you can too.
2017,5,Great app. Easy to use. Great for finding cheap flights. Also good at finding airports.
2017,5,It's so convenient and easy to plan a family trip as well as a quick weekend getaway! Love this app!
2017,5,Great app. Does what it claims and extremely user friendly. Love it
2017,2,"If you want 5 stars, earn it. Don't pop-up asking for 5 stars immediately. Uninstall."
2017,5,I use kayak relentlessly... flight & hotel cost/quality comparisons... I've saved thousands over the years...
2017,4,Kayak Explore is my favorite. It needs a few more user-friendly tweaks for it to be perfect.
2017,5,The app works extremely well for piecing together the necessities of travel. It is a great starting point and ending point for booking travel.
2017,4,Great and easy/automatic but wish the Trip Manager had a map and distance feature
2017,4,Have been using it to create itineraries and notes for our trips. Loved it!
2017,5,Good app. Use it all the time to find good prices and plan trips.
2017,2,Super annoying to login to. Confusing and unintuitive when forced to create an account for initial usage. :/
2017,5,Allows for lots of handy filtering. It's my go to anytime I'm booking flights
2017,5,Best of all. Never had a problem always give me alert on flight
2017,5,The filters rock. I found business class cheaper than premium economy and on better carriers by putting in the time and effort. The gold is out there.
2017,5,"I've used kayak for a lot of traveling needs. It's fast, easy, and mostly the best price."
2017,4,"It is a good app, but It could be better if there were alerts to multiple- city trip. This function is only to round-trip."
2017,4,Easy to use. Like the alerts feature anytime prices change.
2017,4,Calendar view for the best price in the month is missing. Cuba flights.
2017,5,Perfect for trip planning. App works quickly and fits my needs.
2017,5,The filter is one of the best. It makes it much easier to find the flight I want.
2017,5,Kayak gives the best broad range of ticket prices.  Love it.
2017,4,Great assistance with checking different flight combinations and prices.
2017,2,Shows rates which don't stand true when you actually book the tickets. Bogus example was from ethihad.
2017,5,Excellent app. Help you find great deals.
2017,3,Seems like a handy app but everytime I try to book a flight with Delta Airlines it says theyve sold out
2017,5,"Easy to use, and quickly searches different, rental, flight and hotel rates."
2017,5,It simply keeps my trips organized. Great app.
2017,4,I have started using it so I can't really say much about it other than the fact that I found a great hotel deal on it.
2017,5,Simply amazing compared all the best flights and the best deals love it I highly recommend it
2017,4,Great options! But do strange things suddenly and change between pesos and USD with out request!
2017,5,One of the best apps for travel planning. Thank you.
2017,4,I use this app for flights and prices and its a great app
2017,5,Its great.. smooth user interface
2017,4,Best booking APP all in all...but sometimes airlines website offer cheaper fares
2017,5,So easy to use! I love the price alerts!!!
2017,1,Useless GUI doesn't allow us to actually book flights.
2017,5,Great site! The alerts let you know what's going on with your destination.
2017,4,It'll be nicer if we could easily book multi cities.
2017,4,It's been most reliable. Very important to me.
2017,5,Just use it for flight arrivals works great for that
2017,5,Very competitive prices with easy to use interface
2017,5,Very helpful features to get best prices
2017,5,Very friendly user and easy to get information
2017,4,Very useful if you like to save time and money
2017,5,Really good. The best app for traveling out there please download
2017,4,Not so easy to alter what flights I'm tracking but I like it.
2017,5,I find this kayak application is very easy to use. I almost do all my bookings through kayak.
2017,4,"Not entirely intuitive in finding, applying, or using filters."
2017,5,"Amazing all in one place, don't know what I'd do without it when planning holidays"
2017,5,Good app - even if sometimes i have to clean up on a home computer  -
2017,5,Have had good results using this app.  Easy to navigate.
2017,4,Easy to use and helpful with planning/booking reservations
2017,5,Very handy and easy to use..keep good work going
2017,5,"Great  app to quickly check the best fares, hotels and car rentals."
2017,5,Lowest rates and best availability so far ... keep it up
2017,5,It's easy to use and compares enough sites that you get a clear picture of what's available and for how much.
2017,4,Can you add an option for the change of the language? Thanks
2017,5,Have used it to book flights mainly and has been great so far.
2017,5,BEST APP EVER PLEASE DON'T ASK AGAIN TO RATE THANK YOU
2017,5,"Fantastic app, I always use this first when checking for travel deals."
2017,5,I do like that my planned trip stays in the system  so that I don't  have to  keep putting it in
2017,4,"I have just started using it. So far, it gives cheaper fares"
2017,4,4 so far... Still exploring.
2017,4,Good easy to use not as good a full web site but close.
2017,4,You need to found better prices for travelers
2017,5,I have hardly found a better deal than what kayak can find
2017,5,I love that I can choose multiple airports for different dates with ease unlike other popular apps.
2017,5,Easy to use as I track flights when picking up my clients.
2017,5,This app let's me know when cheaper flights are available.
2017,5,Love it! It's my go to when looking for cheap airfares
2017,4,Seems good perhaps missing some airlines
2017,5,So far so good but haven't booked a flight yet
2017,5,Awesome quick easy and the most important thing is great pricing
2017,5,I love it...I can find everything that I need!
2017,5,Blown away by the difference in price the app is finding from other sites.
2017,5,"Easy to use, and it allows you to save flight combinations"
2017,5,"I use the app for all my travel,and for planning future bucket list adventure"
2017,5,So easy to find multi-city flights
2017,5,"Just got it, we'll see if the hype is true!"

2017,5,This is the best travel application I've ever used.
2017,5,"Easy-to-use, I love explore service"

2017,5,"Fast and accurate , good server always loaded fast"

2018,5,"Kayak has streamlined travel booking in one central app. It is my absolute 
#1 go-to app for researching and booking flights, rental cars, and hotel 
stays. It's user friendly and accurate."
2017,5,Love hate relationship! Makes it so easy to book flights that I keep on booking and  traveling! Taking all my money 😁
2017,5,"Super intuitive, love the UI and the price notifications are really convenient"
2017,4,User friendly. Recommended
2017,5,I used flight service which was great.
2017,4,Very helpful in finding the cheapest flights
2017,5,It is a very useful app.
2017,4,Gud enuff
2017,5,I like using this app
2017,5,Easy to use!
2017,5,Super helpful
2017,5,I can find reasonable priced flights anywhere!
2017,5,Better pricing than cheapoair for the same flights.
2017,5,Excellent!
2017,5,Amazing app
2017,5,"When I use this app I know a trip is on its way and I smile. This app helps me out big time saves me a lot of time when looking for flights, but it doesn't show all airlines. Even though I don't fly them I still would like to see them."
2017,3,"The app used to be able to filter flights by number of layovers. After being promoted by kayak to upgrade to the latest, greatest version I now no longer have that feature. I am not impressed."
2017,3,"Use to use this app much more frequently but having downloaded it now, there are some serious problems. A saved flight doesn't update its price. A saved price alert doesn't update until you reinstall. Just disappointing unreliable product"
2017,2,The date picker is garbage. Had to scroll 19 years to find my birth date because you can't enter it manually. And it didn't save to my profile so I had to redo it 3 times. It also doesn't let you edit it in your profile. They pushed out a quick app to make some money.
2017,5,Everything about my travel in one place. Convenient for boarding passes.  No need to have multiple airline apps . Easy to use.. wish I had known about it sooner!
2017,5,"Use the app to manage itineraries for various trips.  Kayak does a much better job than Tripit, Tripcase and Worldmate.  Would gkadly pay for this free app/service!"
2017,5,Kayak keeps me on top of my important travel information. Is invaluable both for tracking your flights so you know if you're going home and for checking your connection as you are pulling up to the gate. Highly recommend.
2017,5,Loving the app. Could you guys add flex date functionality when shopping for multi city flights? That would be really helpful as currently it only takes specific days. Thank you!
2017,4,Loved it more when I was able to do everything through the app but now for some reason they make you go to the website to book flights which is a little frustrating. Besides that it's cool.
2017,3,"Kayak is an amazing service, but the app lacks most of the best things of the website, the two most important, the price calendar and the flight and hotel search engine, I normally have to leave the app and go to the website..."
2017,5,I find flight tracking module works superb. Other modules comparitively good. Response time is faster than many apps in this sector.
2017,3,I like being able to see individual prices and look at packages and if the app offers it I couldn't locate package deals but I will likely always book my hotels threw the app
2017,5,This is the cheapest flight website I have never seen in my life comparing to all other major travel website. It has done some very major change.
2017,5,I'm always using Kayak for rooms and flights I love this app! Gives me the best deals it's always my go to app
2017,3,"App caused ""you must be logged in to save"" error when creating a new trip. Otherwise, pretty handy for managing your trips."
2017,1,Awful. Completely ignored my filters to not display alternative nearby airports. So I am uninstalling never to return. Annoying.
2017,4,Very informative and user friendly. Easy to search flights!!
2017,4,So far so good... will check back once I book a flight
2017,4,"It's one of the best, it gives u the direct phone number of the hotels.."
2017,5,"This is an excellent 🔧 to mach prices, any time I'm interesting in travel I use it."
2017,5,I use the trip feature and it's everything that I need to keep track of flights and other itinerary items.
2017,5,I use this app and price alerts to find good deals!! It is great!!
2017,5,"Very useful, I am super pleased. Getting this app was by far the best decision I've ever made in my pathetic life."
2017,5,Excellent function for multiple flight legs. Smart filters.
2017,5,Helps finding perfect and cheapest price options available for flights .
2017,5,Thank Jah for this app. Very helpful!!
2017,5,I used this app for a European trip and got the best airline price
2017,5,Don't know about everything else but I've gotten around Europe dirt cheap with it. Keep it up.
2017,4,"Like all really good apps, Kayak does all the 'donkey work' in the background...Really excellent!"
2017,3,"Just had a little bug with the alerts, no biggie, however."
2017,4,Good for comparing car  rental rates from different company's all on 1 place on this app.
2017,1,Keeps having connection issues and saying that I'm not logged in when I clearly am
2017,4,good but I want to see a calendar showing me the cheapest flights
2017,4,Wish it would let me complete a hacker rate flight on the app
2017,5,"I have them all, Delta, Orbits, Expedia, this app beats them all. It's the only one that will do multiple city's"
2017,5,This app is great for searching travel Prices!
2017,1,Found a flight 75% cheaper with a Google search
2017,4,Simple and effective way to know bottom of any prices.
2017,5,"Great app; never needed to book hotel, car rental or to cancel."
2017,5,It's quick and finds some really good deals that are cheap and convenient 😆✌
2017,5,Saved me a ton of money. Easier to use Kayak rather than plow through airline sites
2017,5,"So far so good, using it to track price changes."
2017,5,I been using this app for years its gave me avery time great prices use it
2017,5,"Nice, but will not update calendar - Droid Incredible."
2017,5,It is easy to use and I don't have to look for different sites.
2017,3,Wish it had a more specific search engine
2017,4,Easy to navigate finds great prices.
2017,5,Great for flight price deals!
2017,5,"Cheaper options, super user friendly, great app"
2017,5,This is a great app to keep all your tickets and reservations together
2017,1,Can't book a flight it only lets me save.
2017,5,Works good for finding flights
2017,5,Just the job to find what you want at the best price!

2017,3,Trying it out first
2017,5,My go to for travel plans.
2017,5,Only site I use anymore
2017,5,Thank you for booking tickets
2017,5,my go to search for flights
2017,5,My main to go trip advisor
2017,4,Always use it

2017,4,OK
2017,5,I dont use this app
2017,5,keeps me amused
2017,5,Like it
2017,5,super
2017,5,Very prefect
2017,5,I like it really
2017,4,"If you want to have group travel planning collaboration get this app. It has all the basic features of itinerary management.  If you are a solo-traveler and very detail oriented, get Tripit. If you often travel in groups and don't mind paying 29$/ month for group collaboration or 49$/ year for premium account, get Tripit.  Personally, I use both apps to manage my Japan travel itinerary and utilized the best of both, but it's not convenient to input everything twice on two different apps."
2017,1,I booked a room with kayak and they added a bunch of hidden fees ... to get to the hotel and be pushed to pay even more fees. I ended up paying double for my room. The point of these apps is to find the best price that suits me and not to lye to me. This is Unacceptable!!! I was in the position when i got to the hotel at midnight after a long flight and the least thing i want to do is to fight with them. We need to stop these scams!!! I have a budged i want to stick with it!!!! This is Unacceptable!!!
2017,1,"Good apps for finding cheap flights; however, this apps will lead you thru the agents website which are total scam. They will list the price as shown but tax and fees will be added in the end which comes out double in the end. Make sure to read carefully when I book thru those websites."
2017,1,Do a search your get some prices. Immediately redo the search you'll see the prices go up. Do it again prices go up within seconds. They'll tell you it's the hotels selling out. Price increases are actually built into the app.
2017,4,"I've never seen a better price on airfare than tickets I've purchased on kayak. It's my go-to for flights, but I tend to use the app for hotel searches. It could improve on it's depictions of hotels, as some of the photos are inaccurate or outdated."
2017,5,Absolutely love this site. When it's snowing outside and I'm freezing at home I can bring up the explore. I can see all the prices for all the flights in the world and decide where I want to go based on the prices. I never used to go anywhere but Cuba. Then the first time I seen this site I started using it a month later I ended up in Iceland. Never would have thought in my wildest dreams I would have went there what a beautiful place I owe it all to the kayak site
2017,4,"I use it almost every day. I would like it better if there were an easy ""flexible dates"" procedure, and would LOVE it if there were a ""flexible origin/destination"" function. For example, I want to get a cheap flight to anywhere in Europe, and can fly out of any airport from DCA to MIA. Wishing..."
2017,1,"I saw the advert on tv which stated that I could enter my maximum price and see how far I could get....the app doesn't do this, it requires a destination airport.  So this is false advertising. Uninstalled."
2017,4,Doesn't support cruise trips that well. Ports added via web don't reflect on the app. User friendly though and flights are entered correctly once confirmation is entered. Notifications are great too.
2017,4,Very good... like the easy platform. Great app although have not made any purchases. It does however give me full range of what the market is. I have found that Ctrip offers better deals though.
2017,5,"I use it all the time.  I love to travel and Kayak is generally the first place I go once it gets down to pricing out my next adventure.  I primarily use it for flights, but in the event of a car rental I use it as well.  I haven't been disappointed yet"
2017,4,"I use it to price out what trips might cost. I've never booked through them, but I find the price/airline and book directly through the airline. Makes for an easy search."
2017,5,"Really, really well made app. The best part is how it shows your trip and syncs with Gmail. I booked an Airbnb between 2 dates, and the app included it in my trip in an easy to follow timeline. So useful!"
2017,5,Works great!   I've tried a few different aggregators and this one has the best features -  the option to save a flight and track the price especially.   Prices are basically the same for all of them.
2017,5,Kayak is my favorite travel planning app but I hate the recent revision to the hotel search results that now display a photo with each result.  It takes up too much space on my droid screen when I want to search through as many hotels as possible on the same screen and not just the 2 or 3 on each screen with the photos now.
2017,1,Update ruined the app. I can no longer clear out the last destination I selected to enter a new one. Please fix.
2017,5,Amazing app. Was able to get amazing deals on business class travel and car rentals. Highly recommend it. Keep up the good work.
2017,4,Good app for checking flight prices. Loses one star because there's no way to save or keep preferences or filters.
2017,3,"If I installed your app, it's because I don't want to have to""sign in"" and remember password all the time. So...When I open the app and they ask my password...I just want to dump you And NO no I will not choose a new password"
2017,1,"App is horrible! Does not reveal flights that are actually available. Also, does not list pricing for many flights. Worthless"
2017,5,"Fantastic,  my go to app for planning travels. Love tge many filters you can use to find your perfect flight."
2017,5,A friend and I are planning a trip to Japan this summer and it's extremely helpful. Loving the fluidity and helpfulness it offers. Great app
2017,1,"The app does not work well on my S7 edge, it spins when trying to set the alerts. Also, an alert popped up in my notifications and the app didn't allow me to view it."
2017,3,"Great way to shop for flights, but why are Expedia's prices ALWAYS more (a LOT more) when I click through to their site?"
2017,5,I travel often. I always use Kayak to buy my plane tickets. I am able to compare different prices for different airlines and I am always satisfied with my purchase.
2017,4,"Great app but missing a multiple flights feature. My start and end points are usually the same, but sometimes I travel in between."
2017,5,"Love love Kayak!  I find you to be a real time-saver, plus really gets me the exact flying at the best price that I hope for."
2017,2,Latest update breaks app. Switching between cabin classes when trying to run a new search displays previous cabin class search results.
2017,4,Easy to use and useful. I wish there were an option not to auto-merge overlapping travel dates/itineraries.
2017,3,"Great app if you like paying double the advertised rate???, searched for a room in Sarasota, £59 a night for 14 nights, my calculations were about £836?, was well chuffed until I notic3d it was £1980 instead, I, understand there are SOME extra charge for another  £400-500 -but not over a £1000,   Kayak, please ex0lain why and where these hidden fees are going, you are falsely advertising y9ur room rates and I will be contacting Citizens advice to let them know my utter disappointed and anger. Please respond out of courtesy by 2pm or I'm going going to kick up a fuss"
2017,4,My only issue is when it there's one price showing for air tickets but when the app is opened the price  changes. Please fix.
2017,5,Used APP in emergency situation death of sister Easy and user friendly. Got very good rates for flight at a time when dollars and time were both important.
2017,4,Would like an easier way to check out deals on flight plus hotel without car but still really great app overall
2017,4,Multi city option works intermittently and you don't get the flexible dates option when looking for flights. Frustrating.
2017,5,"Easy to use, helped me plan a trip in about 20 minutes. Would recommend to anyone not used to flying or travel"
2017,1,NO way of searching on flexible dates (!??!) ; the results come up in a horrible list - WHERE is the really practical grid that's on the website? WHY are we always forced to use these rubbish apps when the website is always much better?
2017,5,"Greatest app to book, hotels and flights for our business! More options and cheaper than any other one!"
2017,4,Super easy to use and the prices are always up to date. I try to book through Kayak whenever I have a trip.
2017,5,Great interface. Accurate airfare prices. Filters for eliminating options that are unimportant to you.
2017,5,Very easy and convenient to compare flights from different airlines. And the flexible days allows you to view multiple options.

2017,5,Coooolllllll
2017,5,Discount travel
2017,5,All in one
2017,5,It's been a great help in finding deals and planning spontaneous trips.
2017,4,"Although, I'm certainly not familiar enough with other similar apps to provide valuable feedback."
2017,5,"Perfect app when dates aren't important, destinations are, and fun times are ahead."
2017,5,Works well and the ability to forward bookings via email is awesome
2017,4,Easy to use and great deals!
2017,5,Great app for planning and booking trips
2017,5,Great app best
2017,5,Absolutely worth it
2017,5,Great service
2017,5,Excellent
2016,1,"Service evaluation only - not related to app functionality: While I was prepared for additional costs after the reservation (add. fees, insurance,...), I was not prepared for a closed office at the pick-up time, a hotline agent who could not help me in any way because ""the system was updating"" and the reserved car not being available when finally somebody showed up after an hour. I thankfully had to decline the alternative offer (5 times the price the online reservation had promised). Never again."
2017,3,"KAYAK is good for flight reviews.  Booking thru their partner agencies is a nightmare if you need to change anything.  Apart from long waits the agency charges their own fees on top of airline change  fee.  In a recent case,  both fees  together was more than price of booking.  I had to give up two tickets.  Lesson... .. Never book thru agency as airlines offer the best prices and least change hassles plus they have more people in their call center."
2017,1,Not a very user friendly set up. Would have limited options if you wanted to track a flight (  would either only gove round trip options even if only a one way ticket is needed). Would also give false prices for flights!!
2016,4,"Easy to use and nice looking app! Results are loading very fast! However, there is no way to see flights other than for the selected date. Finding the best flight in a particular week for example, is currently a pain, as you have to go back from the results page to select another date, wait for the new results to load, and apply filters again for each new search. Next/previous day button would be very useful. Also, option for viewing flights for multiple dates would be great as well!"
2016,2,"This app is basically a clone to the other big booking sites...Orbits, Travelocity, and Expedia. I get that there might be some limitations, but if I can book a hotel through the website, you'd think I could also get that same hotel through the app, right? NOPE! Only good for booking a quick flight or room, not full blown vacations. Even then, doubt you're going to be getting the best price or availability. Also, compare to the other big sites' apps... likely same results and price. Lame!"
2016,4,We love using this app to help us find the best prices for our trips. We like how you are able to look for multiple dates (within a 3 day range before or after your target date). Very helpful. We've never used the app to purchase the tickets so can't comment on that.
2016,5,"Helps keep me organized when I travel.  Easy to link travel, hotels, etc.  When I arrive at a hotel I have confirmation # and if travel times change I get notification on my phone so I always know what gate to go to for flights!  This is a great app and I recommend it to everyone.  And it is FREE!"
2016,4,"Useful and practical app, if you want to find cheap flights, from and to anywhere. It could be a little better: -There should be an option to show prices from nearby dates. -The airport RAI is shown with the wrong name, it should be Nelson Mandela, not Francisco Mendes. Francisco Mendes Airport was shut down many years ago"
2017,1,I thought it was great till I chose a price and paid for my room then upon going into the motel to get my key they said I needed $50.00 cash extra to pay a deposit??? This was not mentioned during or after the transaction only when I complained I was told there was a link I had to click to see all the unmentioned terms that were no obvious before charging my card!!!! I was lucky my bank reversed the charges and I walked into another motel that was not scaming the customer to get cash out of their lobby ATM
2017,5,Every trip my family takes I use this app first. Great prices and it always shows competitors also. Sometimes redirects which can be a pain to buy from a 3rd party but still gets the job done. I highly recommend to anyone who likes to travel
2016,5,"I've used world mate and trip it, and this is the best trip planner (when bug free). Reads confirmation emails accurately, allows manual input, and ready to view. Biggest problem is you can't access saved trip info when offline, which is a huge headache when traveling"
2017,4,"The app holds cached searches so if you find a cheap flight, then search again the next day it'll show that the other flight is still available until you click to buy and it's no longer available. Otherwise app is great for mobile even though not all the same functionalities on the desktop version."
2017,4,"I've used Kayak to keep track of various bookings (airlines, hotels and car hire) for a long time, and find it very easy to add confirmations via email. I've had limited success with the search function, as you can easily find better deals on alternative sites."
2016,5,"Don't have to keep track of my bookings.  They are placed in trips for me.  No need to try to find reservations, receipts, bookings. Have told my friends. Even let's you find what is available at any airport if it's one you are not familiar with."
2016,3,"At first I thought wow I found the missing piece of me..but then when I decided not to rate this,the app crashed.. It's funny but overall still okay.. Will write again after reinstall this.."
2016,3,Its is okay but there's one site that  refers me to is Crystal airlines that has been permanently closed down but still shows you the price and takes you their fake site that will rob your money. Please improve your app and sites and don't start showing us fake scam sites.
2017,5,"I found cheap affordable hotels for trip to Vegas. They did all the work, so that was a load off. I say try, I think you will definitely find it easy to navigate as well as finding good prices."
2016,5,"Love using Kayak to keep my (mostly business related) travel details organised and easily viewable, both for myself when I am on the road and for the people at home. Shame it uses Bing maps and thus makes tighter integration with Google maps impossible."
2017,3,"The departure dates are good, the return dates not so good. They're a tad too early, but I know there's nothing they can do about that. Navigating the app is very easy."
2016,4,Convenient to use but beware that some deals shown are offered by companies with unreliable customer service. Pay attention to who you are buying from. Research them.
2016,5,Great app for searching flights better than skyscanner. Have also migrated from tripit for flight management. Can you please add a widget so I can view my upcoming flights from a home screen? Thanks
2016,4,"This app was easy to use . Found a great rate, fast. I gave it four stars because I haven't taken my trip yet."
2016,2,"Updated itinerary on Web page version, but info is not showing on mobile app. Keep showing error when I tried to use the refresh button."
2016,5,Several years ago I started using Kayak app for the trips feature. I email my reservations and it compiles it into a daily schedule of reservations showing details with links to the  original email. I also start my search for flights and cars at Kayak.
2016,4,"Some flexibility in search results ranking and filtering, as well as the ability to select a leg of a trip to see all possible combinations in lieu to the selected flight will help get a 5*."
2016,5,"This app is really good for checking flights. I don't travel too much because I'm broke, but this makes it easier."
2017,4,The app is good but sometimes you have to check other sites like Expedia to make sure it's the lowest. I use it all the time for US travel.
2016,5,Love how easy it is to forward confirmation emails to Kayak and have the app create the itinerary for my trips. Saves a lot of time! Thanks!
2017,3,"It's okay, would be better if it included more airlines.  Another feature that would be great is if it let you exclude certain brands/airlines."
2016,4,"It's very useful for booking all kinds of flights, cars, & hotels. For comparing price for your unique travel experience."
2016,4,All features work well.  Fare comparisons is invaluable.  Flight status and alerts are always great.
2017,5,I now pretty much book all my personal flights with this app.  Very simple to use. Works absolutely great
2016,5,It's amazing having trips planned where you can have all the flights and hotels in one area. Also the hacker deals for the cheapest flights is the best.
2016,4,Works great every time. Only downside is that that it doesn't always show as extensive results as the full website.
2016,1,Can't do the basics. Deleted this crap app after trying to find multi city flights
2017,5,"Never had any problems. Gives the information you need, filters, sorts - all works great."
2017,5,Easy to find the flight you need and gives you flexibility when searching (+/- a few days is a great feature)
2017,5,Loving this app . Makes my travel arrangements so easy . One thing missing are prices on dates (calender).
2017,5,My first place to go when booking hotels! Best prices and availability! :)
2017,5,"Best App ever when it comes to planing a trip it give you flight, hotel, and a car just amazing."

2016,5,Maybe it's a habit. I have explored the continent beginning every travel plan with Kayak since 2009. Now I use the app on my phone and find it easy to narrow down my choices and preferences. Keep up the good work!
2016,5,"Great app, great company, it all works smoothly and has so many features including airfare watch which I use often!"
2016,5,I find the Kayak phone app easier to use & more user friendly than using the website on the computer!
2016,5,"Easy to use, I always find the cheapest flights here! Beware of individual airline baggage policies!"
2016,1,"Shows cheap slights but when you click) ""book'' it takes you to a travelUp website where prices are double the quote."
2016,5,Great application and easy to use. Good performance and interface.
2016,4,Is very good but at the end is hard to buy the tickets directly here but other then that is great
2016,5,This is the only app I use to plan flights and the only app you'll need! It's great for both domestic and international flight planning.
2016,5,Best way to start planning a trip over a cup of coffee.
2016,5,It's very good app you can find everything on it love it
2016,5,Use this site often to save a ton on airfare hotel resources.
2016,5,I NEVER use anything else. Hands down the best.

2016,5,Mejor de todas
2016,5,Like it
2016,3,"App is super easy to use. But, it may not have updated information. Immediately after seeing tickets for $580 through Priceline I clicked to buy. However, the Priceline link stated the price at $693 instead. I've since refreshed the search results and kayak still posts the $580 price."
2016,3,"Great prices, amazing traveling options. I'd like to see the option to pre set my traveling preferences such as ""I dont want to go by USA"" on every search I need to filter the airports just because of this. Amount of passengers: I always travel with my wife and my search are stocked with 1 traveller at a time."
2016,4,"When it comes to finding fast and easy the cheapest flight with variable departure and arrival date AND variable Airport in Europe, this is the best app I've found so far. But it also has big problem with the  Price alert function! The cheapest flights are not always being shown there. When you go back to the saved price alerts some of the flights are missing and the airports that have been chosen with a custom range are also missing. I suspect that not all filters are being saved with the price alerts."
2016,4,"Would love the app to have the ability to search weekends only (Thurs - Mon) much like how I am able to do when I search on my computer. This is how most of my traveling is done so the fact that this feature is not an option on the app makes me sad.. Otherwise, I love Kayak!"
2016,5,Very user friendly... Saves me money more often than not. I love the algorithm they use to help you decide whether to buy or wait.
2016,5,"Great for keeping all itinerary details in one place, flights, hotels, cars, etc all in one list on 'My Trips'. Handy to have to save going through lots of emails."
2016,5,Update: 4+ years still easy and simple nice UI and saves a lot of $$ This app is soooo easy to use!!!! Must have for truckers. And transport drivers.
2016,5,I always use Kayak before taking a trip. It saves a lot of time and money. Best app to find the best prices
2016,2,No predictive tools or best fare date. Not as good as the main site.
2016,5,I love this app. Saves me time and always points me in the right direction for convenience and savings.
2016,5,"i like the app because you can search fares by selecting multiple cities, it indeed helps me save a lot cost. The fares are quite competitive."
2016,1,App.keeps on crashing when I try to access Trips tab. Can anyone help ?
2016,3,Have not had Kayak long. Having trouble retrieving alerts
2017,4,Good way to get access  to all cheep different options

2016,5,Thanks
2016,5,Big fan of the ability to forward reservation emails to setup trips.
2016,1,"Latest version takes almost 2 full minutes to go beyond the splash screen, then, when you finally get to searching for flights, doesn't resolve airport codes/cities so you can't actually search for anything! TERRIBLE update."
2016,5,"Been using Kayak for almost 3 years straight now, never had problems and always delivered with great punctuality. From time to time I check other apps to see their prices, options and interface but every time I get disappointed. In short: Kayak is your app to book flights."
2016,5,"Kayak has been my go to travel app for quite some time. I've tried other apps, but always come back to Kayak. The only thing I might change would be if it gave all room choices instead of only the cheapest one, like it does for airline seats. Still the best either way though."
2016,5,"Truth be told, i use Kayak because I'm lazy and i don't want to research a lot of sites. I get the answers i need with accurate information in a price point i want. Its convenient and a good value. What else do you want?"
2016,2,"Current version is useless, as it does not allow me to change departing airport in Explore mode. Had been working just fine until latest update. Please fix it. Samsung Note 3, Android 5.0 here."
2016,5,"Because we're flexible about travel dates, I love their +-3 days grid to find the cheapest round trip schedule. I just wish they also offered this feature for multi-city trips so we can get the cheapest flights there, too."
2016,4,Well it makes your work extremely easy as you get to compare all the flights. Plus the flights they show have the same price that's there on the website.but the hotel section isn't as good.it doesn't have a good variety.
2016,5,"Used this and a few other apps to find last-minute hotel deals on a recent trip, and the Kayak app found us the best offers. This was easy to use as well. I uninstalled the other apps and kept this one. Highly recommended."
2016,5,cheaper prices than even google. so easy to use. push notifications are easy to setup to notify you of cheap flights as regularly as you like. makes traveling simple and less intimidating. love it.
2016,4,"Super easy to use for a spontaneous decision to make a one day trip. (It might actually be dangerous for me to keep this on, if you get what I mean!!)"
2016,5,"Everytime I book a flight, I try with Kayak and every other website and app, you name it, I check it, but Kayak proved to always provide reliable prices and a very good experience. I still check everything, but I always book through Kayak. And I travel a lot."
2016,5,My wife uses so much time checking other sites. I always find what she's talking about (and cheaper)on Kayak! Thanks for all you do saving me time and money!
2016,5,"Comprehensive but simple, intuitive and most importantly: a big money saver. The only app I've felt to be truly worth reviewing. Thank you, Kayak!"
2016,5,"I buy all my flights here. I get to see all of the options at once. It does not have Southwest, but I find them to be more expensive than what I find on Kayak."
2016,1,I loved this app before they updated it. Now it won't even show me hotels for the city I asked for and there is no way to filter the distance of hotels it shows me!
2016,5,Thank you from the bottom of my heart for including the taxes and other fees in each ticketing price. Makes me feel better about the purchase. It was also simple to use.
2016,1,"They show you a flight for a price and when you are ready to book, they send you to the airline page to book from there and they will no sell you the flight for the price Kayak showed you, so yes a bunch of lies, I don't understand what's the point of this app 😤"
2016,5,"Only used it for viewing but I never made a purchase through them.  So I don't know if they are like Expedia which have unusual restrictions to your ticket becouse they buy in bulk or something like that, I quess. And if your using outside of the host country  you might get some unexpected exchange rate charges. So the final actual total charge to your credit card can be more as I've experienced in the past. So they asked to rate the app already and I just installed it like 2 or 3 days ago."
2016,2,Normally a 5 but the tablet version is a joke with no qualifying or date buffering.  Why kill yourself?  Don't overcode this.
2016,3,Use to love Kayak.  Then they started keeping tracks of your entries and pumping prices.. not bueno
2016,5,"Can search one way,  round trip or multiple stops.  Plus they will notify you if the Price goes up or down."
2016,4,"Great app for finding exactly what you need and nothing you don't, intuitive design that makes searching for flights, hotels etc. simple."
2016,4,Used in conjunction with other similar apps Kayak has turned many of my trips into marvellous adventures. Thailand and Cambodia were a blast!
2016,5,"I use this app very often. It's an excellent tool to compare flights, hotels etc. with many options to refine your search."
2016,5,"Food what I need it to do, from flights to hotels, it's easy to make my travel arrangements.  Never crashes, easy to use...what more could I ask for?"
2016,2,"The app doesn't allow me to save a flight to my ""Trip"". Frustrating on some parts of the interface."
2016,4,Nice app but it needs some info updates (like you cant drive in china using international driving licence)
2016,5,"Love this App, keep up the great job. Thank you, I save a lot by using this app. Love the alerts!"
2016,5,"I use this app for checking out flights. It is very fast, accurate. Easy interface"
2016,5,"Great for up to date price alerts, all travel searches in one place and can even share itinerary and price options with friends. Fab!"
2016,5,Kayak has been my Go to Travel App for many years and although I've tried other's it's still my favorite place to search for flights!
2016,5,"Usually my first, last and only stop! Rental cars or hotels or flights or any combination thereof. This site has it all."
2016,1,"A lot of cheaper flights available on desktop version, were omitted on mobile. You'll pay the price of convenience"
2016,4,I would appreciate it if this program would classify the cut rate arm (Rouge) of Air Canada as a separate airline.  And then allow us to exclude it from our searches.
2016,5,It's easy to use and it also show your past search if you want to go back. I like how our shows the full flight
2016,4,"It's a good app, always works. Shows pretty good ticket prices and the alerts are a big help"
2016,4,Makes searching for flights and hotels easy. My go-to app for planning any trip.
2016,5,Searches everywhere. Been using it in my business for years as it gets the best rates. Except Southwest Airlines rates don't show. That's normal though.
2016,4,"+/-days to maximize savings missing from web version. Otherwise, 5*'s."
2016,5,"I've never been so satisfied, left an alert on well before I needed to buy a ticket and literally saved over 60% . Nothing beats it other than clicking your life away manually. Lol"
2016,4,Probably the best app for traveling  from hotels to rental cars and flights. Its a must on my phone.
2016,5,"I've tried other travel apps. This one is the most user friendly, and finds the cheapest flights."
2016,5,Excelent . Keeps me up to date .wouldnt travel without kayak. Kayak has been invaluable on this trip.
2016,4,"Android version need improvements. When i click ""Trip"" on the menu, an empty screen appear."
2016,5,User for over five years. Happy with it. Just simple and fast.
2016,5,"This is the best ""go to"" app for flight planning. Never let me down yet!"
2016,5,I begin my travel search with Kayak and usually 95% of the time book with Kayak. I love the price alerts.
2016,4,Finding flights is easy. I appreciate the alerts and tracking of prices !
2016,5,Amazing information on flights hotels info giving you the full choice and booking options
2016,3,"Some of the functionalities from the website are missing, like the fare predictor. Also, I was unable to add my 2 kids to the search..."
2016,5,Able to set alerts. Thank you for making it easy to do so!
2016,4,Easy to use updates quickly. Hard to believe though fares change that quickly
2017,2,Old app was great. New app seems to have lost most filters or buried them so they cannot be found
2016,5,"Great lay out, easy to navigate.  Also very low prices!"
2016,3,Needs immediate update.. Apps is crashing when connected to wifi .
2016,5,"Just email your itineraries from literally anything, and organize your whole trip. Love it."
2016,4,Quick look at all prices. Alerts are great feature
2016,5,I act out life just like a movie using this all. LOL works flawlessly
2016,5,Amazing app!! Easy to use and very fast at getting me the cheapest flights!
2016,1,"On Android, can't manually enter your birthday as numbers. Must scroll through a calendar which takes FOREVER."
2016,5,Been using this for a loooong time. Its awesome. Better pricing than any other on the market
2016,4,Always my goto site for planning my trips. Hard to beat.
2016,2,"You can't even select multiple airports for comparison purposes, unless they are included in the ""nearby"" list."
2016,5,Love this app. Use it all the time to search for cheap flights back home.
2016,4,I would prefer if it defaulted to my Trips and not the Hotel lookup?
2016,5,No complaints. Does everything I need. I've saved tons of money since I started using it.
2016,5,I always use kayak when I take a trip and the features offered are better than any other website.

2016,5,Use the app all the time. Works perfectly!
2016,4,A fantastic app I've been using for a while now. Highly recommended
2016,4,I don't have to look around all the sites just this one. Great time saver.

2016,5,I book everything on Kayak.
2016,3,Its ok
2016,4,Kayak review
2016,4,Ok
2016,4,Traveling
2016,5,Ofertas económicas
2016,5,Kayak works!
2016,5,I'm a fan
2016,5,Does what it says on the tin
2016,5,Galaxy S6 edge
2016,5,Works
2016,5,Like
2016,5,Fligh
2016,5,Super schweeeeeet
2016,5,Best app for Travel & Tracking
2016,2,"At a first glance the app seems perfect. You can filter flights in many ways, according to carrier, number of stops, etc. IPad app is even better, it can also filter by transit time. However, when I made a reservation I received ""Your flight reservation is Pending"" which remained unchanged for some time. I had to cancel my booking and booked directly using the airline. What's more, many prominent airlines are not represented giving you fewer choices."
2016,3,"I don't receive the flight price alerts until I open the app. The alerts disappear without notification, even before the scheduled flight date. It's good to get pricing. I'm not sure if they are doing updates on this app but I've experienced the same issue for a year now"
2016,1,"I used this app found good price for tickets, but trying to buy any I keep getting Email required message even though I put email in for both passengers, its says optional even. Waste of my time and life. When to expedia. Same price and took 2 mins to purchase. Don't waste time with this app."
2016,3,"If you don't have a price listed, and instead it just says ""call"" or call for price next to that many listings, you have defeated the entire purpose of the app. It's no more valuable than a phone book. I'm back in 1990 calling every hotel for a price?"
2016,4,"I love this app but, there's some things they could improve. Why can't you pre-filter for non-stop flights, preferred airports, and departure times. I hate having to do the same filtering every time after waiting for the results to return. Also, why can't we filter for flexi-days around departure days as you can on the website?"
2016,5,Wonderful 1st class app. You can look back at post holidays as well as looking forward to up coming holidays.  So it's the best App out there for keeping your itinerary for holidays.  Just lacks a bit if looking for flights. Ie  it's a real pain searching for a flight when it doesn't really give the opportunity to only search for direct flights.  So I never book flights with Kayak  . Thank you
2016,1,Please don't waste your time!  In short I wasted an hour of my life trying to get three tickets to Arizona. I had everything entered correctly but it wouldn't accept that I had already entered the email. I figured out that it was because I needed to go into my email and confirm but even after I did that it would not allow me to proceed. I went to Expedia got exactly the same tickets first time try know hassle! Then I uninstalled Kayak
2016,5,Simply the best and getting better. I have been using this tool for years starting with the windows version. This app has improved so much that I think it's even better than the full blown web  version. UPD: Five years later and there is still none better. Great app!
2016,1,"I bought my mobile from the UK and now live in Jordan. Yet the app seems to recognise the devise being in the            UK. I do not understand this ""gotogate"" step and it only has certain countries in the drop down menu in which jordan is not listed so I cannot put my contact information correctly which resulted in me not being able to book through kayak at all"
2016,5,"Been using Kayak for years!  Always reliable and worthy!  Does much ""legwork"" quickly!  Wish airlines would give them access to the same rates as are sometimes available with travel agencies.  Great app and love to support them (Kayak)."
2017,1,"They've changed their design and now don't present taxes and fees fully. I find a flight, go to book it and it's about 175% the cost displayed on Kayak. This site/app is unusable now."
2016,2,When I click on it I get a pop-up to Retry saying there was a problem retrieving my notification settings .. Tried a few dozen times with the same result. Other than that the app seems good and would deserve another 2 stars if notifications settings ever worked... Notifications are a huge part of any app...
2016,1,"They don't use all airlines, but its pretty good. As of recent, the app is crashing, can't do much. I used have this app in pro version on Amazon app store, which work well."
2016,3,"""email is required"" prompt keeps coming up despite my having filled the box. Cannot advance past this page. Would be awful if I lost the flight because of this error."
2016,5,"Anytime I have needed to book a flight, kayak has been the first place I go. Their app is so convenient and user friendly and I love the alerts functionality. Kayak hits the nail on the head when it comes to making shopping for flights an awesome and enjoyable experience."
2016,5,I have been using Kayak for several years for planning all my personal travel. Makes everything simple and when I've had issues with reservations they have gone above and beyond to resolve them. Highly recommended!
2016,3,For example the website allows searching with +/- some days which is really useful. The app does not have it. It shows red on some days which I took to be more expensive days however they were cheaper certainly in some cases. Needs more work
2016,4,Definitely better than the hopper app I recently downloaded. Love the multi-city feature on this app. If your planning a trip I would recommend downloading this app!
2016,5,"Best prices, quick and easy and trusty. I've been using this app since 2011 and im over satisfied. Since im a regular traveller i cant imagine my phone without kayak app."
2016,5,"Great for traveling... However, if you add some of the Google trips + Google flights features  it would be a lot better. This works great."
2016,5,"I've used Kayak solely for about 2 years now, and I can say it's the best app out there for pricing flights, hotels, and cars as well as tracking flights. Thank you for having an amazing and reliable app!!"
2016,2,... But now they started sending annoying emails to follow up with every single search. No simple unsubscribe either. Kiwi is much better now.
2016,4,Interface is pretty easy to use. Seems to give good options but it's always hard to tell if you're getting the best price nowadays.
2016,2,"I got the app specifically to try the trips feature. I forwarded emails for reservations and saw that trips were created online, but I get errors when I try to view or sync that data on the mobile app."
2016,4,"The app is good, fairly easy to use and gives good deals with prices. I haven't seen it show prices for deals but that is fine. It's a good app."
2016,4,"Practical, flexible. Could be faster computationally, but i guess that depends on many factors. Also, more hacker fare would be appreciated, but i surmise thise options they are calculation intensive...."
2016,5,"Kayak has been my go-to travel site for a long time. It is mainly due to the combination of ease of use, functionality, and complete overview of all my available options."
2016,4,"Does its job. Kayak checked most of the things I wanted related to a trip, then stored that info for me in a way that was easy to access and read."
2016,5,"Simple and intuitive, with good filtering options. Have always used kayak on my computer for pre-planned trips and have now been using it on mobile to book hotels and cars mid-trip."
2016,5,"Seems like the search engine is not forced to show certain companies, unlike most websites of its kind. Actually is very useful for multi city flights!"
2016,5,"Love this app! It's great to get instant results for all my trip planning! Including flights, cars, & hotels."
2016,5,It always gives me cheapest flights all where I want to go. Very easy to use no bugs. I love it.
2016,4,"The app would get 5 stars if the first flight searches wouldn't show up ""info"" next to the price."
2016,4,First time user. Enjoying the updates on flights and hotels. Very easy to use and that alerts are awesome.
2016,5,"I've using this app for years and love it! It gives me current deals and provides cheaper deals to choose my destinations, hotels, and car rentals."
2016,4,cool easy but hassle to schedule flight separately through desktop site. wish you could do whole process  through app
2016,5,"Great functionality, automate a lot from your travels and get alarms for important dates, changes, gates... no brainer for travellers"
2016,1,"If you have any add blocker, you will not be able to book anything through the app! If they fix this thing, I will definitely give them 5*****"
2016,5,"Love this app. Easy to use & useful features. Love this website, I usually get great deals."
2016,4,Easy to use. Easy to compare flights. No other app needed for travel.
2016,5,The app has almost always yielded the best prices for flights and the explore feature allows for me to just see where the wind will blow us.
2016,5,"If you ever wished you had an assistant who could search for all possible times and prices on almost all airlines for an upcoming trip, this is the app for you."
2016,5,"My go to App for travel, it is accurate and fast for flights and hotel prices, also keeps track of travel plans with remainders."
2016,5,"Its always my goto app to get best prices for flights, beats others hands down ....."
2016,2,Why the feature of packing list has been removed? It was very useful while packing please provide it back if you want 5 stars rating
2016,4,Easy to use and great deals. However you can't actually choose flights for multi cities.
2016,1,I prezzi di alcuni voli cambiano di diverse centinaia (anche migliaia) di euro da quelli trovati da Kayak a quelli sul sito della compagnia aerea cui Kayak stesso ti indirizza.
2016,5,"I like it because there are many options to get the best price, I can find a nice flight for a good price."
2016,3,"The kayak explore function is really cool, but it seems to crash all the time, and you can't book the flight you want directly through the explore function."
2016,5,Makes it so easy to get travel help you need. Hope they continue to add extra features
2016,4,I always use Kayak for travel planning. Has a good user interface and search results.
2016,5,Great app for booking flight tickets. Easy to use. I like it.
2016,5,Well organized and easy to use. I actually think the UI for the app is slightly better than the website.
2016,5,It's so simple and easy to use. Very good rates and has some of the lowest pricing I have seen. I'm a big fan.
2016,5,One stop finds everything you need to plan your trip. Easy to use!
2016,5,"Kayak is great! Between Kayak, TripAdvisor and Google Maps you can plan it all."
2016,5,"Very comprehensive, intuitive and essy to use app. That's the only site or app I use when looking for flights."
2016,4,Round trip from Cebu - Manila - Hawaii the San Francisco  to Manila  Cebu.. Good price!
2016,5,This is probably the easiest site for booking flight. And the prices it can find are often the best.
2016,5,Easy to use and always has the lowest prices. Saves me a a ton of time searching.
2016,5,I can book hotel last minute on the go. Prices are competitive and full description with reviews are helpful.
2016,5,"Love the ""Explore"" feature. Have found some killer fares on there."
2016,5,Full service for flights. Nice and fast. Recommended.
2016,4,The only thing I cant do from the app is get quotes that combine flight and car or car and hotel etc.
2016,5,"Easy, reliable and excellent user interface.  I really like the convenience."
2016,5,For simplicity and benchmarking good prices it's excellent and a bit more streamlined than the online version.
2016,5,The explore option is enough reason to download. Find when the cheapest flights are for any destination.
2016,5,I am a regular user of kayak and app is even better. Happy to rate it.
2016,4,Always get my cheap deals here. Try it.
2016,5,"Great for multiple city trips, it checks multiple airlines to make sure you get the best price"
2016,5,The best love the getaways for two great prices an many activities thank you guys

2016,5,Great deals now just gotta stay in hotel
2016,5,"Great app to manage your trips! Easy to plan, book and keep track of your itinerary for any trip you plan to have!"

2016,4,Only been using it for a few days and so far it's an easy intuitive app.
2016,5,"I simply love Kayak and couldn't love it more and it's perfect, period. :)"
2016,4,"Excellent, time friendly application that doesn't force ads on the user."

2016,5,Found what I was looking for
2016,5,Super aplikacija
2016,5,☆☆☆☆☆
2016,5,Does its job at finding and comparing flight options.
2016,4,"Helps find the best price for a flight, very convenient, all info is clearly displayed. One thing can be improved - when going back and forth looking at different options, playing with dates etc in order to find the best combination - the app doesn't remember your preferences. For example, I chose that I wanted direct flights only, but every time I amend the dates, the app will offer me all available flights, i.e. not only direct. So I have to choose this option over and over again."
2016,2,"This will only allow you to search for 6 passengers for flight.    We have a family of 7.  Also doesn't put together flight,  hotel and car packages for trips.    Hotels and flights are searched separate.   Thought I'd give it a shot,  but I'll find an easier app to book with."
2016,1,You'd book a flight go through all sets and right at the end error pops up. So you go back and redo and nope this app sucks it's just a waste of phone memory. Uninstall plus they claim to have the hook up on the cheap flights not true not even close.
2016,4,"When i found the app i was excited to try it as i have been using the website for a long time. I have been using all the features. Great app! When you choose another company instead of kayak through this app, though, it doesn't save that booking. You have to save it yourself. Maybe i'm doing it wrong."
2016,5,"Explore option is the best feature.  It tells you when flights to anywhere in the world are the cheapest. I've found round trip tickets to Hong Kong to Houston for $350. Round trip to Orlando for $48, Miami for $98, Vegas for $98, Los Angeles for $108, and many other awesome deals.  Great app!"
2016,5,"Best Flight Finder,  especially fantastic in unusual multicity combinations. Major wish FOR MULTICITY SEARCHES: add tools to find the cheapest block of flights within a given period of e.g. 2 weeks.  Many travelers prefer lower prices over fixed dates."
2016,5,"I use this app all the time to boom flights and hotels. I enjoy the ""Wait""/""Book Now"" estimator. The only thing I would like to see is the cheapest flight per day grid that the browser version has when viewing flexible flying dates."
2016,4,"I really like Kayak and the app, but am a bit disappointed that it doesn't have all the features of the full web version. The feature I miss the most is being able to search for flights arriving or departing from more than one airport that are not near to each other."
2016,5,"Whatever your travel plans, having an app that cuts down the hassle of looking for the right price, is an invaluable service.  There are certainly other airlines and features that I'd like to see added to its list of carriers and services, but at this time, this one's the best for those that plan or have to travel at a moments notice."
2016,5,"Easy to use, but makes more intricate features available to those who want them. This optimizer's dream, allows me to thread the needle to find that flight I knew was hiding in there... Just like Goldilocks... Not too early... Not too late... Not too long... Just right... Oh, and at the right price, too."
2016,3,Kayak is great. Noticed that the app doesn't have the collaborate function to allow other users to edit the trip. Can you please add this  in the next update so i dont have to go to the website version to do this.
2016,5,"Trip analytics would be  great for  for freemium or paid subscribers. Analytics about how many miles(or km)  travelled so far, top Airlines used, carbon footprint. Superb app in any case."
2016,5,"Works well. No issues, so far. Made more than 3 bookings... Doesn't seem like much, but when you're booking accommodation, the same day you are arriving, a reliable app makes life easier. It sure has, in this case"
2016,5,"I have been using this app and their website for well over two years now. It's very accurate with the information about the flights, hotel, rentals etc. Great deals on flights,  hotels,  bundles (vacation packages) etc.."
2016,5,"Easy to use, great for plane, hotel or car reservations. You can compare prices on multiple hotels or airlines. Shop and book the reservation, cause you're done."
2016,5,"Just found the perfect flight, hotel, AND car... all for amazing prices! LOVE Kayak. Especially the new ""explore"" feature."
2016,5,I have been using Kayak for years. Airfare/hotel prices and availability are always the best here. Easy to use and customizable. It is my go-to app.
2016,3,When searching for a rental car it won't allow you to search the areas that are not at the airport where the prices are usually cheaper. For example when searching Minneapolis it will direct to MSP airport only.
2016,5,"I like the prices the site offers, usually cheaper than the actual airline deals, usually. Used it for rentals, do not get the insurance thru the site, go to the rental agency."
2016,5,I travel to Mongolia every Summer so it's nice to have his app right at my fingertips with the alerts to let me know when to buy. Pleasantly surprised!
2016,4,"All of the basic features are available, although sometimes I question the reliability of the results. Frequently deals appear that are ""no longer available"" when I follow the link."
2016,4,"So far so good! I just stayed using it (2 weeks). Finding great deals,  easy to use,."
2016,5,"Only once have I found a better or cheaper flight elsewhere, and I'm consistently looking for various flights.  I trust this app to bring me the best flight at the best price"
2016,5,"Great on the fly to book hotels and cars. Flights seem a bit trickier with fewer options than the website, but still pretty good."
2016,5,Kayak app makes it easy and quick for you to find the best deals! Pair it with Air B&B and you've got everything you need at your fingertips to plan your next adventure!!
2016,4,App should provide +/- 3 days option like in the desktop interface. Everything is pretty clean and nice.
2016,4,Use it all the time. Easy to compare prices. The filters are also very intuitive!
2016,5,It is very convinient and easy to find fast and cheap flights.  Thank you for making it easier for us!!! :)
2016,5,Help the customers in case there is changed travel plans after booking the tickets. That means you should have good understanding with airlines
2016,4,I enjoy using the app the alerts that the ticket prices have gone down save me lots of money. Thanks
2016,5,"It's past my bedtime, I'm restless, and the explore feature is all of the best reasons for me to keep stalling while daydreaming of travels"
2016,5,"Whenever I need a quick idea of what a trip might cost, this app is my go to. Generally book travel through Kayak as it is."
2016,5,All in one. One app for all for all travel inquiries. Unfortunately I came to know abt it very recently
2016,4,"I love the ""Google"" of Hotels, Flights, and Car rentals, however the prices could be better."
2016,5,"Have tried another apps to book flights, such as Skyscanner, but neither of the other apps are as user friendly as Kayak."
2016,4,"It does a good job across the major categories i.e. flight, hotel, car rentals."
2016,4,Super helpful when last minute car rental was needed. So great to open an app and get my rental purchase completed within 3 mins
2016,5,"Best airline search tools and filters anywhere by far.  Use it on PC, Android, and iOS."
2016,5,Very easy to use and gives me the best prices in minutes. I really recommend this app.
2016,5,A quick and reliable snapshot of available flights and fares. Works better with the update.
2016,5,Booked a flight from Orlando to Minneapolis and back for $43. Can't beat that!
2016,5,So easy to use. Love the explore option to view all prices for the month.
2016,3,"Just recently reinstalled the app and it keeps crashing, always been OK before and will give 4.5 stars once it stops crashing!"
2016,5,"Great app, with which i've used this software to get good air tickets and hotels."
2016,5,This is by far the best app to find cheap flights anywhere. Try it out!
2016,5,I never travel without checking out what Kayak has to offer for either flights or accommodations.
2016,4,"Wish it would let you save the flights you're interested in, then go back to select the one you want within 1 hour."
2016,5,Have now booked several flights using this application and am very pleased. Thank you
2016,5,I use this service almost exclusively to find the best deals on all of my flights
2016,4,"All in all, I like the simple interface and the ease of booking flights."
2016,5,Great app and the intelligent interface make it easy to search and book my travel.
2016,5,I can make flight arrangements and track my departure directly from my phone and at any time.
2016,2,"In BOLD color ""BOOK $XXX"". Not real price."
2016,5,Makes it easy to monitor ticket prices when shopping for the best deal!
2016,5,"Easy to look up & book flights, hotels and car rentals."
2016,4,"Lots of options for cars, hotels and flights."
2016,4,Like the app it's a quick check on what the cost is to get away.  Simple and intuitive.
2016,5,Great app for checking flights and getting the best deal!
2016,1,Flight is more costlier than the price listed on the airlines website
2016,5,Keep up the great work. Thank you
2016,5,Great app... Easy to use. Very functional.and helpful.
2016,5,"So many features, great for planning trips"
2016,5,Great tool for quick price searches and booking.
2016,5,"One of my favorites Mobile apps for travel. Very well organized, my first go to travel app."
2016,4,"One of my go to sites when checking airfares, and always easy to use"
2016,5,I loved it. It is one of those applications that truly u can describe it as handy.
2016,5,I love this app! It's very easy to use and the fares are cheaper than any other app I've been on!
2016,5,Saved a small fortune on flights at home and abroad. Nice to have control of connectors and in country flights.
2016,5,Simply easy to use. It's my go to app to check airfares.
2016,4,"Great app, easy to use and modify."
2016,5,I like using Kayak to compare fares before buying tickets. I rely on the built in confidence meter when timing the purchase.
2016,5,Works really good. I enjoy it.
2016,5,"The best of the besy. It is Very usefull, a must have application."
2016,5,"Excellent app, easy to use, always finds the cheapest flights, no issues at all"
2016,5,"Easy to use, I can change airports easily and I like the confidence level guide regarding prices."
2016,5,Search capability with filters to fine-tune search is the best among mobile apps.
2016,5,I need to share Kayak with my google calender because sometimes google calendar can't read my booking email from gmail
2016,5,I wouldn't book any other way after this app!
2016,5,Been using it for a while and it's always been my go-to travel app.
2016,5,No need to use any other app to search for flights!
2016,5,Always gets me the best prices and the app makes it that much easier
2016,5,Very easy to use and view have no doubts to recommend.
2016,4,Great app but display prices can be misleading
2016,5,Makes planning/taking trips so much more SIMPLE & EASY!!!
2016,2,"I keep getting ""Error"" upon opening!"
2016,5,Others come and go but Kayak just keeps getting better!
2016,5,Great app but find the hacker fares a bit confusing and change to quick but thats not kayak fault
2016,5,1 stop shopping......shows you many of.the rates all in 1 stop.....eliminates time and saves $$$

2016,1,"I am not sure what is improved in the app. But the fact is that app is extremely dumb in handling flights in the trips it creates. Should your try to change your flight and receive your changed ticket, don't bother to forward it to kayak. They send you confirmation email, but the flight never ever gets updated showing old details. If you delete manually, and try forwarding the ticket again - they send you a dummy confirmation that it has been added. It is not. Ever. Very bad in itinerary management."
2016,5,"Great app, just make sure you clear your cache everytime you use it. If the price goes down, it won't show a lower price unless you clear your cache. That's just a standard website tip for any airline in general. Always clear your cache before looking a 2nd time!"
2016,5,I have searched for tickets through every other app but KAYAK made the difference!! Real prices with no added fares and taxes... Best choice and very easy to use!
2016,5,"Android app isn't quite intuitive, but Kayak makes planning/managing trips really easy - emailing itineraries to ""mytrips"" is like magic. (And it's still free!)"
2016,5,"This is a great general travel ap. I usually do reservations on airlines' and hotels' sites. But for all the info before deciding, kayak is great."
2016,5,"Found room, entered card info, arrived and checked in without issue. The process was about 2 minutes all in all. Will use again."
2016,5,"Used Kayak for over 3years now. Mostly for flight search. Good rates,good interface,all over the World flights. Just amazing"
2016,4,"Used to use TripIt, now prefer this. Just wish I could set the Trips screen as the default screen, hence only 4 stars."
2016,5,Kayak got really amazing over the last 2 years. No other app is even close as good as this one... Keep up the good work !
2016,3,"The application its good and so easy to use,  but the information its not compelete.  Can somebody tell me, that the price include driver or not?"
2016,4,"I've been using it for 3 years and it's quite helpful. It just needs to add more airlines, because quite at times you may find cheaper rates from airlines which kayak isn't including."
2016,4,I have a pre-paid VISA card. Can I use it here for buying my ticket? Thanks
2016,3,"Like the website, you should be able to book different package deals ie flight and hotel or flight hotel and car."
2016,5,"Puts all the info in one place,  and you can customize your searches based on what you are looking for!   The layout is nicely done!"
2016,5,"When traveling, the real time info really makes everything so simple. No papers or emails to looking for."
2016,5,Quick and easy to use. So useful if you're just looking to check prices or booking.
2016,4,"I like the app, but some options have to be cleared/selected every time you search; i.e., number of stops. Nonetheless, it's a very useful application..."
2016,5,Really great app...works well.. does exactly as promised..extremely helpful...use a lot
2016,3,It doesnt always show the same prices as the desktop version and there isn't a flexible date feature
2016,4,Get great deals. Hotel on the beach $49 dollars a night :)

2016,4,It is a great app and would be five stars but some of the search options are hard to find. But I still always use it
2016,5,Super easy to find global deals.  Just explore
2016,5,Great metacollection tool for all your travel needs.
2016,4,Biggest beef I have is the lack of tabs or memory. You click a link and all your progress is erased.
2016,5,Made my life easier for me. Flew through the booking in no time.
2016,4,Just missing southwest fares and should figure a way to get email alerts to be pop up notifications
2016,4,"Gives a great starting point for travel,  I review daily for the best fares, would recommend as a source"

2016,5,Low prices down on Caribbean airlines plzzzz
2016,5,Saves you money!!!
2016,5,I use it to detail my trips
2016,3,Works well
2016,4,Limousine services
2016,4,Excelente app
2016,5,Does what I want it to do
2016,5,I like it too much
2016,5,Use it all the time
2016,5,Yeah
2016,5,Buisiness man
2016,5,Using this for years
2016,5,Use it daily
2016,5,❤❤❤
2016,4,"It's a great UI, lots of detail control for refining searches. Like the explore feature for flights to explore low flight prices from destination. My main complaints would be the inability to move the app to SD card, (every amount of free space helps) and the lack of app feedback method to avoid putting app feedback suggestions and problems in this rating and continually revising. But, great app. Thanks."
2016,4,"I use Kayak almost exclusively when searching for flights, and also to keep track of my itineraries. The feature i wish you'd add, though, is the ability to enter all our frequent flyer info, and have you include that automatically on bookings with partner airlines. Then I'd never miss any miles!"
2016,5,"Best app of its kind.  Though I wish it included more airlines (JetBlue and Southwest are notably lacking, but other sites don't include them either), it presents an uncluttered interface and fast access to all relevant criteria.  Always my first stop when buying flights or renting a car."
2016,5,I've planned several trips blew and have searched between so many apps and sites. Kayak has always been my go to. I can plan everything directly from the app and find deals and special case searches when booking flights. Going on a trip? Go Kayaking!
2016,5,This app is very easy to use. I love that it doesn't ask for a bunch of unnecessary info to generate a quote.  I was very surprised to find out the quote also includes taxes and fees.
2016,5,"It's really a slick app. I don't travel a lot, but when I do, I use Kayak to book hotels and all that jazz. Good work."
2016,5,I love that I can check several providers at once and can even plan a trip around getting the best rates. Excellent design.  Excellent delivery. And it just keeps getting better.
2016,4,"Nice app, however it needs sticky filters for the duration of an open session ( layover times, price, etc ), and then why the change in bluetooth and other permissions?"
2016,4,"Very good app, I'll give 5 stars ✨ after you add Omani currency. Thanks"
2016,5,I go to Hakan every year and I always get the best prices when I book with kayak. Don't know sky but it's always the cheepest
2016,5,"Very easy and well organized for each trip. Helps with information about hotels,  rentals and flights all in one place."
2016,4,This app is pretty useful and I have found some great deals for airfare through it.  Didn't give it 5 stars because sometimes the deals are no longer available.
2016,4,"I hate checking fares from several sites, though I always do. Kayak is usually ""on"" with rates. I like the alerts, too.  So there's that."
2016,4,"Had a little trouble with new interface (at first couldn't find flexible dates),  but once I did the App does a great job."
2016,5,Love the ease of use for this app!  Saving multiple flights to compare on trips is a great feature.
2016,5,Best deals available. Very satisfied. Thank you kayak.
2016,5,Best prices and intuitive interface. The explore feature is amazing!
2016,5,"No spam, no silly hoops to jump through. Of course there are some airlines that don't share schedules, but all the available ones are on this"
2016,5,Always easy to use and quick to load. I appreciate te filters too! :-)
2016,5,"I always use this. Love the new security wait times option and the gate change notification, often before the airport themselves make the change!"
2016,5,"Great app to look up flights, rentals for cars or hotels"
2016,5,Very useful. Intuitive designb simple to use. Just great!
2016,5,Love this app! Always helps me to find the cheapest flights!
2016,5,I love this app because it gives me the lowest prices on my trips!
2016,2,Searched for a same day room then found much lower price by walk in without any discount.
2016,5,Use it for all my little trips.  Pretty convenient.
2016,5,Very versatile and full of features to get good deal!
2016,4,Too bad you can't do a +/- 3 days search (or at least I haven't found the way to do it)
2016,5,So easy to use. Very easy to compare prices.
2016,4,This app is as useful as the website. It has all the same filters and sorting options.
2016,4,Very good ap.  Wish I had a bit more control.
2016,5,Quick and economical results...good to have multicity option. I love this app
2016,4,It's nice to be able to track flights across multiple airlines.
2016,5,User friendly!  Its great!
2016,4,Need to be able to add KTN. This is not available even on website.
2016,5,I have tried other apps and they really suck. I love Kayak its so easy to use.
2016,5,You can search by exact date or by +/- 3 days.
2016,5,I love it. This app gives me always the best and chepeast options.
2016,4,All great site to use for multiple possibilities.
2016,5,"I use this app all the time, so helpful with multiple destinations!"
2016,5,You will not find a more user friendly app that also offers the best fares
2016,5,Quickly see most available options (except for Southwest)
2016,5,"Easy to use, am here now checking on special offers....."
2016,4,"Easy to use, great prices!"
2016,5,Saves time and money with the ability to compare rates at your fingertips
2016,5,Very easy to use and smooth and very well written for the mobile platform
2016,5,Great app it's easy to use and good information
2016,5,Love this app. Probably more than the actual website.
2016,5,"Very useful, love it. Love it more :)."
2016,5,"Fast, easy, intuitive, good app!"
2016,5,Don't leave home without it.
2016,5,"One of the best, great design and UI"
2016,5,"Quick, Clean, Uncluttered, Beautiful, Powerful!"
2016,5,"Fast and efficient, simple layout and design"
2016,4,"Simple, Efficent app"
2016,4,Easy to use and with great offers
2016,4,Missing part is flexible options
2016,5,Does exactly what I need for International Travel!
2016,5,Best prices!
2016,4,Great and handy app
2016,2,I'd rather stick your Expedia.
2016,5,I love it and use it routinely!
2016,5,User Friendly Application.
2016,5,Works great every time

2016,1,"I always loved this easy to use app and used it all the time when looking for flights. Lately the pricing of the flights has become very unreliable as the offers are cluttered with prices of obscure online travel agents, which I don't want to book with as it often causes serious problems in practice. I only want to see prices that you can actually obtain directly at the website of the airlines, but there is no option to exclude all the others, making the selection process very clouded."
2016,5,I've done almost all my flight comparison shopping and booking on this app in the past 5 years. I love it.
2016,5,"Great app, works beautifully!"
2016,3,"It's buggy for me. Won't save, tells me to use the desktop site. While trying to book a multi leg trip I unknowingly bought the first ticket. I filled out cc info then the site timed out. No confirmation screen. Just got an email hours later saying I'd purchased the one ticket. I mean I wanted the ticket but it would have been nice to know I'd purchased it. Also the other two tickets which now I'm buying separately. Not impressed."
2016,4,"I use Kayak to ""research""  flights and prices from multiple destinations for many trips. Kayak is reliable, easy to use, glitch-free, and displays accurate prices as they are from the airline websites. Sometimes smaller airline companies or additional flight times are not listed, or the prices of the last search continue to show in subsequent searches, but when I go to book, it then shows the current, increased price. That's annoying.  But I find this app to be the best place to start. Thanks, Kayak!"
2016,4,"Love it for my travel needs. Easy two use and gives you a lots of options. You can manage so many of the options.   .... I used to use it for hotel reservations,  but not any more. I selected a hotel. Specifically requested non smoking room. The hotel offered me a smoking room. I refused on the ground that I can not sleep in there. Hotel said that they cannot refund as I had booked through a third party. I contacted kayak. No use. I sent my complaint via snail mail Did not get any refund or apologies."
2016,1,"They will put a rental in front of you that isn't what it says to be.  I used this app for a rental car with Dollar and they put a picture of a Chrysler 200 with ""or similar""  next to it. What I got was an Economy class which is like a Kia Rio or Ford Focus hatchback.  Complete Bait & Switch. I sent an email to Kayak who's response was basically 'this is Dollars style not ours, deal with it"". No empathy at all about the situation. . NEVER. . USE. . KAYAK. . APP!!!!"
2016,2,"Searches for flights just fine.  I set a bunch of price alerts which haven't given me any information for four days, even though they say, ""new alerts."" UPDATE: I reinstalled the app and every time I sign in, it gives me this message: ""something went wrong. Please try again."" It even does this after I changed my password."
2016,2,"Booked a room, arrived at the hotel and found they were overbooked.  Called before re-booking other hotels listed by Kayak, only to find other hotels displayed as available by Kayak were also full.  We were left high and dry. Kayaks toll free number response?  We would get a complete refund in three to five business days.  Don't become their next victim use a different app."
2016,1,Why mess with a good thing? Recent updates have made me very unhappy with the Kayak app. An app that was once my go-to app for flight fares is now getting moved to my deleted bucket. I do not want ALL nearby airports on by default! Do not force me to unchecked 12 boxes everything I want to search for fares. NO THANKS!
2016,3,I used the your site in the past a lot and it was great. What happened to you Now the site always gives false information. After selecting the flight price and after transferring me to respected site I got a message ' oops the flight is unavoidable or the price has been changed '. Please don't waste our time some airlines  is using you just to transfer us to their website and doubling the price.
2016,4,I have to say I like this app since I can sync trips to it no matter where I book at. I also find all the reference links most convenient to use when traveling and it does lead me to find the cheapest travel when I go back home.  Only complaint is I have to log out and back in before I could see the trips.
2016,4,"The app is great, but it's so sad that you can't combine One-way + Flexible date flight alerts. I am moving anywhere in December to another country and only wanted to get the best one way flight price in that month. Why don't you implement this? :)"
2016,5,"This was my first flight period. Flying out of the US was crazy to me. This app really made it easy for me to choose the right flight. I also had help spotting the right hotel for my stay. Everything you need in one app, to travel anywhere in the world. I definitely recommend it and I'll always use kayak for future travels."
2016,5,Only use it for flight tracking (so far). It's very good except that it crashes and has to restart quite often - seems to be when Wifi drops of and then in again. Maybe when switching networks? July 2016 update: still using it for most travel but the hard copy PDF itinerary had altered and is now much lower quality than before.
2016,5,"Very robust, fully loaded (chat, voice and video) light weight app. Takes very less memory, no ads, high quality and works like a champ. Compare to other apps consumes 70% less data on video calls with very decent quality."
2016,4,"I liked it a lot better before the most recent update that put the hotel search as the default screen rather than the My Trips screen. If you would consider a Settings option, that would be great. For heavy travelers, opening to My Trips is very helpful."
2016,5,"My favorite travel website/app for many years (since it was Sidestep!)  I do use others, but this is my go-to (default.)  Love the functionality, clean layout and right amount and type of filters and options."
2016,4,Almost as good as the website. I have had some issues with booking hotels though... Keeps telling me it can't find my session info
2016,5,Helps me out every time. Love comparing prices in one place. User interface extremely easy. I've been using it for years to schedule my international as well as domestic flights. Great job guys!
2016,5,"It's my first call when heading out on the road or vacation. Before checking other sites, I always start with Kayak. The app version works great and its interface allows me to use as many features as I would on the website."
2016,4,I don't tend to use much on this except the trip planner. You can email all your booking references to Kayak and it pulls together a nice itinerary for you. Very easy.
2016,5,"The BEST at filtering results, period. Find airfare with a particular layover airport, or length of layover, or whatever... Find out here. Same with hotels... finding multiple filters like distance from city center makes things easy. Thanks, kayak."
2016,5,Kayak is my go to app to find flights since I travel a lot for work. I love all the filters so I can find my perfect option for a flight. EDIT: Love that the confidence rating has been added to the app now!
2016,5,"I found it very easy to book a flight on my Galaxy Note 4. I was able to change my dates, cities, and airports. I have not tried to book a hotel or reserve a car, etc on the app."
2016,3,"Great site...buggy app. Every time I turn around it can't access my trips, or update them, or something. I've been forced to just use a browser."
2016,4,"I don't use the all of the features on this app, but the price alerts are excellent,  though I wish I actually get a notification. Its great for quick fare look ups and tracking price fluctuations."
2016,5,Try saying that five times fast! Kayak has helped us travel around the globe. This app helped these 40-somethings find the best deals when we're away from the old laptops.
2016,5,"With the update, I can no longer get to the flight tracker from within one of my trips. Please bring this feature back, and I'll restore my 5 star rating. Update: I think it's back?"
2016,5,Best tool for planning your trips. From air tickets to hotel booking to car rental all made easy. It has saved me alot of money.
2016,5,"I haven't purchased through it yet, but so far searching has been very simple and very successful. I LOVE how I can include nearby airports at either my destination or starting location independent from each other."
2016,5,"I travel quite a bit, and am always looking for the best deals. This app has helped me score some great airline tickets on several occasions. No issues."
2016,5,Great app after starting it up 3 times . The apps crashes every time I open it until the third time. Then I can finally check my trip itinerary.
2016,5,"Kayak keeps the myriad parts of my trips organized, and is so easy and fast to add them. My trips have included both domestic and international travel throughout Europe. I may not always buy through them, but I always check them first."
2016,5,Kayak has been my go to app anytime I have any travel needs. I even have my friends hooked on it. I especially like the notifications they send out for pending flights or price changes. Kayak is number one far as I am concerned.
2016,5,I use Kayak for keeping track of all my business travel. It very quickly recognises and imports confirmation emails from every source I've found so far. The calendar integration works well.
2016,5,"Have been using this app for few months now, but have always been a big fan of their site. Friendly app, clean navigation and functionality, great prices (I always found the lowest of all sites) on Flights and Hotels."
2016,4,"It gives good overview on prices of different flights but booking tickets through it is much higher than original airlines. I can't understand why,!!"
2016,5,"I almost hate to leave a 5 star review, because I want to keep Kayak to myself. The 'explore' option has made for the best last minute travel options!"
2016,5,"App is very easy to use, it gives accurate prices for a combination of flexible dates. It's easier than some airlines websites. Top notched App."
2016,5,"Fast, not buggy, has helped me find convenient and inexpensive flights. Kayak doesn't always have the lowest fares, but it sometimes does, and for me it's been really helpful."
2016,4,This makes finding travel accommodations quick and painless. Search prices to where you are going to know how much to save and expect to spend on travel and shelter. Good for on the go.
2016,5,"I love Kayak, always my first stop for checking flights! The multi city feature makes planning a doddle, even for me, and I always fly to and from different cities."
2016,1,"C'mon, Kayak...you can do better than this!!  I used to love this app, but now it can't find an internet connection. Running CM13 on my Mi4c, I can find and buy tickets from CTrip app, but can't do *anything* from Kayak! Uninstalled/reinstalled several times, WiFi/data...no luck."
2017,1,I put in a flight date and it puts in a return date 3 days later. No place APPARENT to me to alter return. So FRUSTRATING!!
2016,4,Easy to use. I use it all the time for flights. Especially to get a good ball park figure. I love how easy it is to look at multiple days of departure from the different airlines.
2016,4,"The app is great, however, they need to streamline the trip planning. Also, they exclude some airlines, which is likely so Southwest and other airlines don't dominate certain fairs."
2016,1,Why Kayak needs access to my bluetooth and camera in the latest update?.  I understand kayak wants us to use the app during the trip and not only for flight reservations but no need for the camera and Bluetooth.
2016,4,It is intuitive and relevant. Brings up the best deals for your trip. Sometimes deals that you won't find on Google flights.
2016,4,This app is pretty good except for one thing....... The tool for entering date of birth is utterly dreadful. I had to tap back 57 years in single months to put in my birth date....... So only 4 stars from me......... Hmmm.......
2016,1,"Ever since the last update search results don't have the locations until one selects them individually, waste of time and backwards development"
2016,5,"This is a great app that keeps all of my travel details in one place. Flights, hotels, and rental cars.  Very easy to use"
2016,5,I love the flight comparisons..but I ESPECIALLY love the explore flights tool where I can see which dates are cheapest to fly anywhere in the world. Good feature for spur of the moment travelers.
2016,5,"I travel frequently, and always use Kayak to start my flight searches. Gives accurate info, and because it saves your last search, it is easy and quick to check the latest ticket prices for a particular trip."
2016,4,"Pretty simple and easy to use, works very quickly. Not always the best price but it is a good option when looking for cheap flights and hotels."
2016,5,"I have used this app for around two years now, my family tracks all of her flights through it and it helps us know who is traveling where and when. The automatic gate and schedule change feature is awesome"
2016,5,Perfect app for travel bookings.  You can have your flight booked in a couple of minutes.  Love it!
2016,5,I think it's a very good app. My first time use gave me the best results. Thanks to the developers.
2016,3,Good for flights not for hotels. Also this is Priceline owned so I see biased comparisons I.e. this always compares rates by default with Priceline which is also owned by same company
2016,5,"Flights, hotels and car rental all in one place. What else do I need for my trips?! That's all you need."
2016,4,So far I have found hotels last minute with kayak during long trips across the country. Definitely saved our butts!
2016,5,Great app. 1 improvement would be to add multi day checks to multi city flight checking. Would be very handy for booking well in advance
2016,4,"Easy to navigate, lots of options for filters, and tracks flights too. Only thing I would like to see an improvement on is the option to view my flight selection on a low-fare calendar."
2016,4,It does what it claims..... good for a quick trip..or just to daydream. Here I am still using KAYAK and planing my second trip........
2016,2,"Why does a travel booking app need to know/control my bluetooth connection and get information for near by devices? While i ask, why does it need camera control access?"
2016,4,"You must be logged in to do this.  Click OK and the app closes.  When accessing from my chrome browser, I am logged in.  Guess I will need to uninstall."
2016,5,Can't fault KAYAK..  I use the app as a frequent traveller and I get the best deals. Thanks KAYAK!  :)
2016,5,"Best travel app, great rates and easy to use. Planned my Euro trip earlier this year :)"
2016,5,"So complete, effective, beautiful and easy to watch, I travel constantly so this app has become my assistant flawlessly. Keep it the way it is!"
2016,5,"Works great, I just wish the calender would drop down like Priceline's. I find Priceline is still more convenient."
2016,4,"Kayak has shaped my travel for the past years. And this app, although pretty straight forward, does it for me"
2016,5,Useful for comparing several websites and travel options. Also has a good travel alert. Easy to use. I recommend it.
2016,4,"I use this app mostly for flights and car bookings, but I'd use it for hotels as well if I could book packages."
2016,5,"If you know when to use this app, you find the best deals ever. I only search it once, 8-9 weeks out."
2016,4,This app is a good tool to use whenever I looking for a good deal on flights. I would definitely recommend this app/site to others.
2016,4,But then I ve only been using it for a day. I used to use the online version n it's pretty similar
2016,5,Always use it to check special offers on flights.  Has a wide selection of airlines.  Great deals!
2016,4,Kayak is easy to use and seems to dig deeper than the more common travel search apps.  :)
2016,5,My go to travel app.   Finds the best prices.  Makes planning a trip a breeze.
2016,5,Kayak has such good rates compared to other websites.. i love this app as well as the computer version.
2016,5,This is an amazing app with guidelines to all available rates of air tickets. I used this app for booking thrice and always i got the best deals..
2016,5,I have used this app since 2013 and still find it the best for finding Flights & Hotel globally. Thank you KAYAK 😀
2016,5,My first stop for scoring the best price on flights. Mobile app is very easy to use on my Android phone
2016,5,Great app love it. My go to app to find flights. Always find the best ones. Amazing.
2016,1,"Booked through this app, however, I had to cancel due to medical reasons. Provided medical certification but neither kayak or airline would take responsibility."
2016,1,Unless they can clearly indicate why their app needs access to Bluetooth connections and devices. I'm going to delete this app. Unnecessary snooping.
2016,5,I use this app everytime I decide to fly or if I need a hotel room for a trip. It's absolutely the best!
2016,5,"Kayak not only provides great travel purchasing options, they provide free trip tracking for all details, no matter where they are booked from."
2016,5,I love the one stop shop concept. Very easy to navigate. I'm pleased.
2016,5,Great for when you've planned a few flights and accommodation. Could be better if it could display your boarding cards
2016,5,This is the first place I go when I need to book a flight or find a hotel. Love how it compares and filters based on my preferences.
2016,5,Really great prices!!! But the smaller airport in your given state is usually going to be cheaper anyway.
2016,4,As a stand alone app it works well a havent booked yet but the info looks great and up to date.
2016,5,Love Kayak. It's easy to use and rarely do I find any site that beats their prices.
2016,5,"So helpful checking various flights on Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0"" tablet running Android 5.1"
2016,5,I've used this to find the best deals on flights and hotels anywhere on the web. Love it!
2016,5,"Great user interface, really easy and intuitive. I like the % confidence that shows up sometimes."
2016,5,"Easy to use, finding cheaper options and reliable pricing. So far the best flight app."
2016,5,Easy to use. Thanks to developers. Can't think of anything I would add to it.
2016,5,Great and easy to used. Great Prices and alerts. Can't complain.
2016,5,Very useful to help me find the right part for my trip. Is true that this app look in every company
2016,3,It's real easy to use. I'm use it to search for flights and hotels once in a while.
2016,1,Antes era bn sencillo ahora ya quieren cuentas de fb o google. App borada de mi cel
2016,3,I get a price alert notification but when I click on it the  app crashes.  The search feature is cool.
2016,4,Worth having to quickly check hotel and flight prices.  Trustworthy and helpful

2016,5,It does it all
2016,1,"Be aware of this app. It provides limited details on your hotel reservations. When you get there, there can be many hidden costs. Reservations are not refundable and there is no one to reach. It is a very obscure business that exploits the app. Format not to deal with customer's complaints. Your credit card is billed and no one can be reached. Use the app but call hotels directly. They can be accountable this way."
2016,5,"Update: problems fixed. Very happy with this app now.       Old review: I find Kayak Trips superior to Tripit, and the phone app is part of the reason why.   The interface is very nice.   Complaints: the app crashes way too often.  Also, there are many fewer search options for booking flights. This is probably because of the phone interface is limited. Still better than any other phone app for booking.  Also, could use a few widgets."
2016,2,I use it all the time to check and track airfare and hotel prices. Flight tracker is also super helpful to find out gate info.  Updated 6/16/16: I really don't care for the new version. Fight tracker is not accurate and difficult to read.
2016,5,"Awesome app! This app is a combination of all the travel apps combined. If you have this, you will not need any other travel apps. This is awesome!!!! To make it even better, the Kayak people will listen to their app users. I complained about a recent change to the hotel reservation making it not as flexible in searching and booking reservations, and someone contacted me to let me know they took my complaint seriously and will refer the matter to the appropriate person. Now that problem has been fixed."
2016,5,I just love being able to search different places to travel to. My little escape on my phone. Brings me joy. I like that I can explore or I can book a solid trip. And then it says right on my phone. Easy.
2016,5,All I need/nothing I don't. Awesome.use it live it love it. When i was stuck in singapore after missing my flights kayak was helped me.booking a ticket and getting home. I love singapore btw.
2016,5,Only complaint is sometimes the prices aren't right. But! I do see that it is corrected today. I use this app too book most of my flights. Or at least compare prices.
2016,5,"I use this app for all my flights and ad a basis for my hotel prices. It's the first app I open when I have a new destination in mind. Sometimes I can find sites with cheaper lodging options, and sometimes Kayak has the cheapest."
2016,5,I love that it shows me the gate before I even get to the airport. Even more I love that it saves my trips so I have a record of where I've traveled. Otherwise I'd forget.
2016,4,"Fairly easy to navigate, love that I can save trips and potential flights and hotels. A tiny bit clunky to navigate ""backward"", but worth tolerating that."
2016,5,I have found some of the cheapest bargain flight tickets on Kayak (for example Huston Texas to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia with Singapore airlines for $400 one way). Make sure you enable last minutes deals alerts if you are an avid traveller.
2016,5,"Hi, I like the addition of the airport maps. The next step is to add airport reviews including airport restaurants :). Thanks. God bless. Aaron"
2016,5,I use this app regularly for planning travel and booking hotels. Saved a lot of money using this app. Thanks very much to the Kayak team!
2016,5,This app is great! It gives you the best prices and comparisons from different airlines.  Very useful totally satisfied.
2016,5,"User interface is intuitive & easy to use.  Search prices are on par with the other popular travel search engines/apps, but I prefer this user interface over the others."
2016,5,Saves time over airline sites if you are looking for the best deal. Love the explore feature when I know when I want to travel but not where.
2016,5,"Very helpful travel resource, i use Kayak frequently to help me find hotels and flights."
2016,5,I LOVE the explore option. It allows me to brainstorm possible trips and toss those ideas toward my friends.
2016,5,"Simple interface, easy to use. The price alert is a nice feature as is the buy or wait recommendations."
2016,5,When ever u need a flight. Hotel. Or car rental. Its the one to go for..
2016,5,"Great app, for all your hotel flight  searchs, I  use it,  all the time never had a problem."
2016,5,Love how easy this is to use. It's so simple to change dates and airports to find great rates! Highly recommend!
2016,5,I always use kayak to buy all my flights and make reservations at hotels for the best prices!
2016,4,"I use this app when I'm picking up new arrivals from the airport.  So much easier than the ""hurry up and wait"" game."
2016,5,You can organise all of your trips separately and keep an eye on the prices before you book.
2016,5,Easier then going on the website! The app is really user friendly.
2016,5,Love this app! Helps get the best deals out there
2016,5,"Light on the eye UI. Very quick and most importantly, the best prices."
2016,5,"Saving trips, saving flights to trips, sending confirmation emails to trips -- all of this is genius."
2016,5,You can search for any flight or hotel by the easiest way ever
2016,5,"Very user friendly, love the simplicity and always the best prices"
2016,5,"Best way to find flights, I love the flexibility of price alerts."
2016,5,Best prices and absolutely hands down easiest way to find flights!
2016,5,Always useful. Fast easy to use. Great results
2016,5,"I personally feel that, with a single Kayak, I save lot of time to look for other website including some searching engine such as Expedia."
2016,1,I dont know why but it shows me results of flights that are no longer available.
2016,5,This app checks frequently  for what I need and saved in the search . And very accurate.  Even checks southwest  in which is unheard of.
2016,4,"""Price alert"" doesn't always alert about price changes; but otherwise, great app to use"
2016,5,"This app is fast, reliable and best of all provides multi city search. Love it!"
2016,5,"There's no bs, really awesome rates. Love it!"
2016,5,I find this app very convenient to use &  provides useful details. I would recommend this app
2016,5,"Nice  app, very convenient to  use. Suits my needs well"
2016,5,"Easy to use, multiple flight combinations available. I check it each day for cheap flights."
2016,1,Found cheap o air had better deals
2016,5,Awesome deals and uodates on cheap flights!
2016,4,I have used ebookers and find this a much better app comparatively
2016,4,"I'm using it very often and every time I use  it, I like it more"
2016,5,Kayak/Explore would be useful to have on mobile! talk about impulse buy
2016,4,Always my first place to check flights....
2016,5,It's great to have best rates all in one spot without doing multiple searches
2016,5,"Whether planning a trip or last-minute emergency, Kayak is the first app I go to."
2016,5,Seems to show fights less expensive than I can find otherwise.
2016,5,Pretty good. Works well
2016,5,More thorough search for flight and car rentals than other sites.
2016,5,"Quick, convenient,  and easy to find great prices!"
2016,5,Excellent interface...Thanks.
2016,5,"I like how it shows all itinerary details, and updates me on gate changes and delays."
2016,5,I've used a lot of different search engines and this seems to work the best.
2016,5,Offers a real time flight tracking compared to none.
2016,5,This app covers all flights that I'll ever need to look for
2016,5,I love the easy snapshot comparison with the different airline prices
2016,5,Very easy to use. Simple and useful!

2016,5,Excelente App
2016,5,This is the longest of all travel booking apps I have kept on my phone..not just because the app is good and easy to use..also because I really get better deals be it be of flights or cars or hotels as compared to any other sites in this counter. One feature though I would like to see coming is multi city flights. Anyone listening pls take this feedback..
2016,3,"Still love the app, but can no longer zoom on terminal maps like I used to since update.  Used to be able to get airport, flight tracking directly from trip screen.  Now have to manually enter it on another screen. No email support either, have to call."
2016,5,"I used to spend so much time searching all of the different travel sites. Then, along came Kayak. I hopped on board and haven't looked back. I've probably booked 25+ flights and/or hotels from Kayak. Never once a problem!"
2016,4,"Kayak is my go to for trip pricing. App works perfectly. Wish they could add some of the website features such as flexible searches by weekend, month, etc. Overall no problems with app n still very useful"
2016,3,"I love this app! It makes finding hotels a breeze. Unfortunately, it is not very useful for me as it has no way to add children to your total."
2016,5,Just a really great app. Easy to use. Very handy and convenient. Able to research and save multiple flights. Great prices always. Shows changes in prices both up and down.
2016,4,"I've occasionally found cheaper flights using other websites, but the convenience of this app still make it the best way to search in my opinion. Love all the different criteria that I can use to sort my options."
2016,5,"The app does what it promises to do. Flights are priced cheaper on this app compared to others. Also, I notice flights being priced differently across platforms that's is iOS vs Android. Anyway, I would recommend this app for anyone who wants to book flights."
2016,5,Saved me $80 on a round trip to Los Angeles. I can now buy a bunch of food when I get there. I'd give them 6 stars if I could.
2016,5,"Booked flights, cars and rooms through this app.  I quit using Travelocity LONG ago.  This one is easier to use, it seems.  No fluff, just business!"
2016,4,I love the alert feature!! I travel overseas every few yrs to see family. Its great to get good deal!
2016,5,"Keeps you update on prices, their alerts are the  best for getting the best price ... I highly recommend kayak to all those who love to travel."
2016,5,I love this app. I have been flying every two weeks for job interviews across the country and I am always able to find the best deals on here.
2016,4,Very helpful and fast! Sorts through all the airlines and even third party websites to find you the best deal!
2016,5,"Very happy with this app, easy to use, handy alerts. I use this app for all my trips. I love it!"
2016,5,"I use this app for actual flight purchases but I mostly use it to dream about traveling the world.  If you love to dream of going somewhere new, keep the dream alive with this app."
2016,5,I use kayak all the time to book & sometimes to just get an idea of what average prices are for travel.  The Explore feature is fun!
2016,5,It's nice to see different cost on large map layout. Doing this way you might just pick a place that you thought was just to hi in cost to get there
2016,3,"Glitches sometimes, doesn't list fees very well. A $75 hotel is often $115."
2016,5,"The interface is pretty good, there are also very good prices. I highly recommend it!"
2016,4,Fastest and least glitchy of the travel apps.  Best at multi-segment trip scoping.
2016,5,"Fast and easy to use to compare flights. Plus the ""buy"" or ""wait"" rating is extremely helpful."
2016,4,Love this app. Could be improved by allowing filter by time of day for travel.
2016,5,"It is a very unique app especially for the flight booking , you can see the cheapest is 3 days ahead and before the date you select . it also gives you the chance to select nearby airports."
2016,5,Awesome app! It searches for the cheapest flight! Download it now!
2016,4,Only con is that a few hotels do not list their prices.
2016,5,Best prices on here and very easy to use.  I use nothing else
2016,3,Pity the hourglass has disappeared. You no longer know if the app is still searching.
2016,4,Love the fact I can save my searches and book multiple times and places and still get the best deals
2016,5,I love the Explore option on the app. It's easy to find places to go on a small budget!
2016,5,This app is easy to use and compare prices and routes
2016,4,Great app to find deals if you really enjoy traveling.
2016,5,App remember my selection and it's saving my time. Good job
2016,5,This App has been very handy and reliable. Will always recommend it to family and friends..
2016,4,The only you can find multi city flights booking
2016,5,Easy to use. And Easy to compare prices.
2016,5,"Recommend it to all my friends,  one stop shopping for best fares!"
2016,5,The app is super easy to use it love . That price confidence thing is amazing!
2016,5,"I like this app. Very good, helpful and easy to use."

2016,5,I like the alerts and organizing everything into trips.
2016,5,Great! No problems parsing email anymore!
2016,5,"Easy, accurate & fast! Love it!"
2016,4,Pls rectify regular crash problems.

2016,5,Great
2016,5,Great
2016,5,Love it
2016,5,It has everything you need to plan your travels
2016,5,Must have app.
2016,5,Iove this app.
2016,5,Vacation planning!
2016,5,Use it a lot
2016,5,You can costomize the plans so specifically it's easy to find the exact flight that you want. And if your willing to move the flight around a couple days you will find flights cheaper then ant travel agent could get.
2016,5,Hasn't failed me yet
2016,5,Easy to use!
2016,4,"Great app!  The only reasons it doesn't get 5 stars is lack of economy airlines like Southwest, Frontier, Midwest, etc.  (probably beyond their control) & the fact that a few times when I check flights it shows one price, then when I go to book it, that price is not available, I go back,  refresh the app and it still shows the unavailable fare. Aside from that, I love how easy it is to use & to customize itineraries.  The +/- days and 'nearby airports' are great features!"
2016,4,"I'm on Kayak almost weekly to book travel for our small business and find it very easy to use. Compares rates from most other sites for 1 stop shopping. Only suggestion is to improve the location function for hotel searches, as it often fails to recognize a specific address when I enter it, so I end up searching by city or nearest landmark only..."
2016,5,"Great app! Helps me book all of my flights easily. Also, has a fun feature that let's you enter a price and what kind of trip you're looking for, then boom... a list of the cheapest flights to beaches, ski destinations or whatever your heart is telling you to do! Plus, in the normal search mode it's simple to play around with dates until you get the price you want. I've definitely recommended this app to several people."
2016,4,"The features are decent, better than hopper thanks to the number of airlines.  However the notifications are awful.  A flight went down $100 and I didn't get notified.  It has since gone back up."
2016,5,"This app is so easy to use, and does a thorough search of the essentials. I am always pleased with the prices, and other results I find. Filters are specific, results load fairly quickly, and the Explore option is incredible. So far I have not run into any glitches or other issues, so I am very impressed."
2016,5,"Kayak used to be hit and miss, but over the last two years they have done a REALLY good job of implementing features that those of us who post on the forums actually ask for. I used Kayak, went away from it for a while, but have used it to book 4 flights again over the last year. Keep it up!"
2016,2,"I've historically loved this app, but in the past couple weeks I've noticed that if I check fares for a flight over multiple days it gives me the same results but will tell me the session is expired. Even when I refresh it I continue to have this problem and it won't give me updated prices so I can't find flights."
2016,5,"Makes planning trips easy and fun. Great features -  Price alerts, hotel info, flight tracker even stores your travel info. I keep coming back to this one early and often."
2016,3,"At first it would show me great prices and i was able to buy tickets, now whenever i find a good offer i try clicking on it and it says session not found, why put offers that no longer exist anymore. Its very frustrating -__-"
2016,5,"This app requires no great effort. I also need it all the time when I look for a place to sleep or a flight. Moreover, the app has countless filters. Impressive user interface, too. The app as well provides good information. I recommend my friends to use this app."
2016,1,"Certain cheap flight rates are falsely displayed especially for Etihad Airways that majically disappear when you click ""Book now"" button. Called Kayak and Etihad both said it is the other guy's problem. VERY FRUSTRATING!"
2016,4,"Just like on the web version, it's easy to apply different result filters. However, one filter I can't use is choosing a departure or a return flight from the list of round trips to see what other flights it gets paired with and for what prices."
2016,5,"Always helps to direct me in the right direction. I use the app to compare prices for me, and then go to their recommendations directly to double check the price differences. Sometimes one is cheaper than the other."
2017,5,App itself is really great but I did not understand why they require my Camera access! I will edit my review to 5 stars if App permission is change again. Peace :(
2016,5,The app works great! I've used it hundreds of times to search for flights or hotels. Very easy to use! You can easily access saved flights if you're watching rates.
2016,5,"Been using Kayak for many years. The best around for flights, although I've had some issues with regards to checking prices for travel to Cuba. Some US/Cuba embargo problem I would imagine, so I would expect this to change soon."
2016,5,"Full functionality of the web site, super easy to do flight searches. The sort/filter menus could be a bit easier to use (changing a filter requires a lot of taps), but overall a very solid app!"
2016,5,Great tool to view all airlines in one place.  Only feedback that would make it better is if you set an alert and don't include all airlines the low price should be for only those airlines you were watching....it also defaults to the discount airlines like spirit and don't use them for international travel
2016,4,"Very good app. Some options could be easier to fetch (filter only direct flights, for example) but it's stable and easy to use."
2016,4,"This app is great when you need a quick search for flights, hotels, and cars.  I gave it 4 stars only because I think the earlier version allowed for more options when selecting criteria for flights, etc."
2016,5,I use this app to book virtually all of my travel needs. I wish the app will let you look at the whole calendar to determine the day (s) to purchase the cheapest fare.
2016,5,Easy to use. Simple interface for checking flight itineraries on my mobile. Prices aren't necessarily best but this app is a good source of information.
2016,4,"Good app, some of the features are a little too slick.  I.e. flex dates. (Not super intuitive)"
2016,5,I've used it over and over again for flight hotel and car. Super easy to see all my options and play with the dates. Thanks Kayak!
2016,4,But could still use some tweaking here and there. Somtimes it hangs up...msking me sign in to just check on availabilty. Not good.
2016,5,"I like to bounce around on one-way tickets, and kayak makes this an absolute breeze. I always the people to use kayak if they're trying to travel cheap."
2016,4,"I like this app.  I mostly use it to price flights.  I like the flexibility days option, so I can find the best price."
2016,1,Price changes every time I go to check out. Even if it is within the same minute of find the original price. Very frustrating.
2016,5,It's super easy to use and it allows me to find nearby airport with ease. I also use it for booking hotels when I travel. It's a keeper♡♡♡
2016,5,I use this app for nearly every travel booking I make. It's rare that I find cheaper prices elsewhere. Kayak for the win.
2016,4,Love kayak. It's my go to for flights. Car search feature never returns results though
2016,5,Out of all the other travel apps out there it consistently gives you the cheapest flights and most options ...a definite must have in your modern personal travel kit .
2016,1,Really? No flights from 2 different airports? This is not an app that's working in my opinion! Uninstalled!
2016,5,"Best app for airfare, also wonderful tracking cost & flight which is what I use it most. Also good with car rental when I occasionally shop for it."
2016,5,I've been planning a trip out to Georgia for my buddy's wedding and this app is really helped making it easier finding flights combined to make it a lot cheaper
2016,5,Wonderful app! Easy to use and best prices! I'm so glad i downloaded it for my trips this summer!
2016,5,Booked a multicity trip from uk to 9 us cities. This tool helped me reduce costs by 2/3.
2016,5,"We do travel quite a bit, and Kayak usually gets me the best prices. I highly recommended."
2016,5,"Great app for searching for flights, with lots of filter options. As an aggregator it relies on other sites to do the booking, so that experience can be variable."
2016,5,I book most of my flights through kayak. Love the app! Fully functional.
2016,1,Everytime you click on a ticket to purchase it takes you to a different site and increases your purchase price. Not worth the hassle !
2016,4,Been using the web since 2010. Hopefully they could improve it with monthly price so we could compare better
2016,5,One of my go to travel apps. Gives great results and the fare alerts are great. Great android app
2016,5,"This thing is awesome. A few less features than the desktop one though, but still excellent."
2016,1,870 quoted includes all taxes fees etc. Went to book each ticket was 1200. Worthless search. Uninstalled
2016,5,The best app for world wide traveling! Best prices no against can offer you any bette!
2016,5,I really like this app so far.  The airfare price predictor and graph from the past prices is cool also.
2016,5,Use Google to fins flights so you can find the cheapest possible.  Then use the dates you found and you can find even cheaper with Kayak.
2016,4,I have booked all my domestic flights so far using Kayak.. They have a GO!!
2016,1,I bought my tickets months ago the day I go to leave my flight was changed and I had to pay $409.00 to fix it just call the airport Ppl this app is trash!
2016,5,"It has the most airlines that I've seen in any flight searcher, and with practically the same prices as booking directly with the airline"
2016,5,I've been using kayak for all of my bookings be it planned in advance or in emergency.  Very reliable and the bookings are real. I stopped using other apps completely.
2016,4,The price comparisons from all the different airlines is wonderful!!  It does a little while to load the information.
2016,4,"Its easy to use, and found some cheaper flights... Great one!"
2016,5,"Easy to compare prices, good filtering capability. The ""Hacker Fare"" feature is especially helpful."
2016,5,Hi! download UZURV to make advanced reservations with the Uber or Lyft driver of your choice. get free 3 ride code lojmo27 uber code hzbas free 20$ ride
2016,5,I love the simple interface and thoroughly comprehensive search. It keeps giving me the lowest prices by far
2016,5,"Best site for finding and booking flights. Easy to use, effective filters."
2016,5,Great app. Needs better price alert options but other than that great app
2016,5,I like the new hacker update. Searches for multiple airlines to get me the lowest airfare.
2016,5,I use Kayak for all my flights... Love this app!
2016,5,"Great app, good deals, and I even signed up for cheap flight alerts."

2016,4,Great app to have when checking flights and hotels on the go..!
2016,5,I love this sight and this app is do simple to use. I book all my flights with them.
2016,4,Nice app. Fairly easy to use on phone.
2016,1,"Prices are different comparing with the airlines website, when you try to buy here, got message "" sorry fare increased ""."
2016,5,Easy to use interface. I use kayak even when I know what airline I am going to pick
2016,5,Well made. End-user awesome!
2016,5,Best deals always... using since 3 years
2016,1,I will continue to use the web version because the permissions required for this app are ridiculous.
2016,5,Keeps me up to date with the prices on flights that I am tracking and gives confidence level.
2016,5,Booked a cheap flight to the Caribbean and I like the variety of hotel options they offer.
2016,5,More Accurate.. But price showing different in each links.

2016,5,Always found flights and options for around my price range extremely good
2016,5,Use it for mostly every travel need. Love it!
2016,3,"Why do we have to put every single time the preferences like stops, stop over hours?"

2016,5,Very useful app. I rely on it when I am planning to travel
2016,5,Excellent tool to have to always find the best prices.

2016,5,Easy to use. Love the help when booking flights.
2016,2,Can't read hotel reviews in app. What are you hiding?
2016,5,User friendly & helps out a lot when planning trips
2016,5,"I have been using this app for any travel related search, i just watch for third party sites as I get directed to them."
2016,4,"There's a few glitches once in awhile, but overall this is a very useful and informative app"
2016,1,Doesn't give my trip itinerary so basically this app is useless for me
2016,1,Its not opening in my phone plz do this as soon as possible ppz fast
2016,3,"Easy, a little glitchy at the moment but still works."
2016,5,never found a better price for a rental car or flight
2016,5,"Great app.  I've used the website on my PC for years,  and now the app has most all the same functionality."
2016,5,Love the app. Wish you can add the flexible search like you have in web

2016,5,I love the hacker fare results (two one way tickets put together for round trip)
2016,5,I think is really good to look up prices but i have never buy from here.
2016,5,"Good thing, I'd like notifications on saved flighta price changes"

2016,5,Always uses
2016,5,This ap is great!  It's user friendly and accurate.  Very easy to navigate and definitely the lowest prices of the 6 other aps I tried. I Highly recommend and will definitely be using for ALL future flights.
2016,4,"Best all round app of its type. Rome2rio is a better approach, but doesn't yet return cheap enough flights."
2016,5,Kayak is great! I experience the usual problems while traveling such as flight delays and other problems caised by other people other than Kayak. Kayak takes some of the burn off these other headaches.
2016,5,I love the ease of use and ability to sort. I travel for a living and open kayak every single time I need to fly!
2016,5,"Always find the best deals for every service they offer; from rentals to flights, just the best!!"
2016,4,Easy and give great choices of flights. Filter work great.
2016,5,I always find great deals and best prices...
2016,5,Its a great app it lets me know when there's a cheap flight and it not only shows me one company but all of them so it lets me find the right one for me
2016,5,"Been using it for years , first on the desktop then laptop and now smartphone. Still doing what I need."
2016,5,"Helps us find the best deals, including  nearby airports and days before/after."
2016,4,Great place to start your travel plan search
2016,5,It's good - -real - time price alerts are my favorite part
2016,4,now is good.. before this app is to much problem....
2016,5,"Great feature showing flexible dates, that is a key differentiator."
2016,5,Its helps me save 💰....i recommend it to anyone planning a trip
2016,5,Gives many options that would take hours to search individually.
2016,5,Quickly searches a ton of options and has easily configurable search options
2016,5,"Easy to use, and usually the cheapest flights."
2016,5,Gives great comparison across the search and different sites
2016,5,v20 fixed crash. perfect!

2016,5,It is super
2016,5,Use it a ton
2016,1,"Extremely cumbersome and a pain to use. 1.) Timezone is automatically set to Automatic on some events but transportation (e.g. trains) are set to the country you are travelling to. So when you plan your itinerary, your timeline goes haywire because the Automatic timezone doesn't properly reflect the country you are in and there's no way to change the timezone on the app, you have to use a desktop to do it. 2.) Events templates available for the desktop and mobile app is different (e.g. Tour) is not available on the desktop version. Bottomline is stay away from this app unless you want to use the mobile app and desktop simultaneously to add your itinerary which in my opinion is not worth the time. Use Google Sheets instead."
2016,3,"I am always interested in getting the best deal, so I figured that this app was the way to go. The first time I used it the buy confidence was at 90% so I booked the flight (from the airline's website) because on the app the price was no longer available. That's not the worst thing, if I have to book from the airlines it is no big deal.  My issue is that on none of my subsequent  searches is the buy confidence showing up. So this app is no longer useful. I'll be deleting it later today"
2016,2,"I just downloaded this on my Android Samsung S6 and the letters ""am"" or ""pm"" don't show either in portrait or landscape mode..instead I get ""7:30..."" and plenty white space where useful information could have been given. Since the time of the flight is one of the most important selection criteria it makes the app pretty useless."
2016,1,"Doesn't have the same options as the website. Select multiple airports in region is missing. The day flexibility isn't as good as website. Although the day flexibility on website needs serious improvement as well, can't filter based on arrival times since the time graph doesn't recognize the different days. Just waiting for someone to improve on the interface and I'll switch."
2016,1,"I don't understand what's so hard about allowing push alerts but your app absolutely REFUSES to save my alert to use push notifications. On both my Android AND my iphone4. I can neither create nor edit an alert to use push notifications. No matter what, it reverts back to email notifications. I do not want a crapton of email alerts in my inbox. Please fix this. If it's across both Android and iPhone I can only imagine it doesn't work for just about anyone."
2016,1,Hotel prices in UK / London quoted don't seem to including VAT (20% tax).  When you come to book the bargain price is no more....  Very poor pricing disclosure policy.  Kayak starting to lose credibility.
2016,1,"to enter my whole itinerary, including trains, hotels, flights booked elsewhere. I wish I would've started using this ages ago!  With this new version, my trips page keeps crashing. I need this operational when I go on my trip next week!!"
2016,5,"kayak is truly helpful. the best traveler's app. good prices and even if you don't end up buying your tickets from kayak's price, the search will yield other apps and webpages prices so you can compare and/or buy from other webpages"
2016,1,I am using a zenfone 6. The app always stops when I go to my trips. I have tried reinstalling numerous times. I'm tired of waiting for the update that will fix my concern. I used to like this app but because of this I will now try other travel apps.
2016,1,"After using I've gotten several spam calls the first one after a computer voice thanked me for using, KAYAK I selected yes and was transferred to strong accent that told me to ""F*** off"" and disconnects. I tried to call it back and got the ""this number can't be redialled"" I got another 3 today."
2016,4,"Google flights is by far the best and fastest search engine for flights out there. Kayak remains great though, especially on hotels. The app can be a little slow at times, but does the job."
2016,1,Not having much luck using the app. Doesn't give you pricing for most hotel. Tells you to call the hotel. Also doesn't let you search near exact locations or venues. Too general
2016,5,"I only use kayak for flight searches. But it has the best functionalities, together with Hipmunk of any tool on the market. I just with it was possible to give in two airports and have the app scan EVERY date possible and find you the best price during a whole/half year."
2016,5,"Kyak is a perfect app to use for getting an overview of flight availabilities for a variety of route options.   Fast and comprehensive,  but does not cover the low cost carriers (like Southwest) and may find better deal on airline's website; so I always check direct bookings and at least one other search tool before buying."
2016,3,It employs bait-and-switch a little too much for my liking. Reels you in with low prices and hikes them in seconds on subsequent pages. Gives you different rates from different computers; from data to WiFi. OK for  when you're in a bind.
2016,1,"When your ""safety"" changes result in me screwing with the app on my phone for 10 minutes and STILL not being able to get in,  it becomes pretty worthless.  Would close my account if i could,  but i can't get in!"
2016,5,"Only needed this to keep an eye on rental prices for an upcoming trip and even though I ended up going with a different option, I am impressed with the daily quick info I needed without ever having to log in, and the ease of changing options and criteria for my search. Only wish it would include the price alerts for other services, not just flights."
2016,4,"It doesn't search multiple days, so I have to repeat the search if I need to see what's available a day later. - Now I see it will search a week at a time... I needed to find that feature but it took some time."
2016,4,The flight comparisons are great. I wish there was a feature that would let you choose the time of day you want to leave and the time of day you want to return. Right now it just gives you what's available for the lowest price.
2016,2,"This has traditionally been my go-to app for travel, but now when I load the app, it immediately crashes and closes. It seems to have something to do with 'my trips'. That sucks since that's why I love using this app! Help!"
2016,1,I was ready to book and checkout. At check out I read the terms and agreements and was ready to pay. It kick me off the site. So I tried again and no more tickets available. I would recommend booking on a desktop. NOT mobile friendly
2016,5,"I used other various searches before,  but this is hands down the best with ability to narrow down based on departure and arrival times plus duration and even connecting airports.   Really important for international travel.  I'm hooked."
2016,5,I love the world travel option. Last year we pulled up the map and choose our vacation based on the prices to the different countries. It was nice to have it all in one option instead if entering every airport code.
2016,5,"Easy to use and convenient. It's worth doing a search on another travel site though. Kayak is often the lowest, but not always and it pays to double check."
2016,4,"Really like the competitive prices on the App for hotels and flights , just wish it gave you the option of picking your seat on the flights instead of having to go to the airlines web site separately and then picking a seat like you can on the other little guy's app ...."
2016,5,I love kayak as it shows all major airlines and usually has cheaper options than other sites I've tried. They also often have great hotel deals. Never had a problem with bookings.
2016,5,"This is a very useful tool. If you want the most effective flight searches, use Kayak in conjunction with Google Flights. Together, you will find great prices."
2016,3,"when kept on basic searches it works well. some of the other features like price alerts doesn't work i.e. an ""error occured"" permanently."
2016,3,"The app itself is convenient and user friendly, but I'm able to filter the airline based on star alliance etc online, but am not able to do so on the app. I will change my rating if I'm able to filter by airline club in the future."
2016,2,"This was a very good App but as of late the prices are no longer accurate when heading to the actual booking phase, and not by a little either. This really needs to be fixed or what's the point of using this App."
2016,4,Has multi destination flight search so it's far superior to momondo and sky scanner. I guess Android is a new operation system so probably they will implement by 2020...
2016,2,"The 1st thing this rental place is off site but in the area. You have to call, then catch the car rental shuttle, then take their shuttle...next after checking rental agreement they offered 250 miles per day, but on kayak offer was unlimited miles...not acceptable practice...please advertise your policies upfront.."
2016,5,"I  fly at least a couple of times a month and it is always very helpful in finding the right flights. I also use the hotel feature an additional 6-8 times every month when driving, I can always find a great place at the right rate in the area I need to be."
2016,1,"I don't understand, I have been denied access. Please fix this. For now, 1 star only because it won't let me give 0 stars."
2016,5,"Please include bed size for hotel room listings- there is no way for people to tell what kind of room they are getting if they choose a ""double room"" before they buy. Information like King size bed, queen size bed, two queen size beds etc is helpful"
2016,3,"This was my go to app for everything...especially rental cars. Now when I try and use it, kayak isn't responding. I've sent several feedbacks but still no changes. Please fix"
2016,5,"I have been using this app for a while now, and it's really all I use anymore. I just booked a trip to Costa Rica for two with flight and hotels for less than $1k."
2016,4,"I like this app, I just wish I could pick a specific airline or airlines to track with the price tracker tool. Other than that I think it's going to be very useful."
2016,5,"Easy to use, always finds the cheapest prices. When i think i could find cheaper i always end up coming back to Kayak. Thanks Kayak!"
2016,5,"The kayak app is very user-friendly, and gives me access to all the best prices on flights, hotels, and car rental. I use it first anytime I'm planning travel."
2016,5,"I travel frequently, and have booked my flights many times through Kayak.  Easy and intuitive to use app, makes it really easy to view airline options, timings, stops, etc."
2016,1,"Booked a car with them. When i arrived the rental car was closed. I delayed my trip,  had to book a hotel and the middle man is unreachable."
2016,5,"Really good offers, I was trying to book a flight on several airlines and they were super expensive, then I checked kayak and the same flight was approximately $100 dollars less!! Yaaayyyy!!!"
2016,4,It would be nice if they had an option to check dates for flying that are close to yours.  I've booked a few few flights with this app and it's worked flawlessly
2016,5,Love kayak it's been the best for finding flights....I have yet to find a cheaper flight any other way including using all other apps and websites!!  Simple put they are the best!!
2016,5,I use Kayak religiously when I book my vacations. I can look over a lot of Airlines in order to find the best prices and dates. Thanks Kayak.
2016,5,Let's you save searches you've made if you're contemplating certain flight paths and what not. App is easy to use and easy to plan with from my phone 👌
2016,4,It has all one can need...just wish it had more info websites of airlines hotels not included due to negotiations maybe?
2016,5,"Hago la mayoria de mis booking en este app. Pero creo que deben tener acceso a otras lineas aerias que hacen viajes en Estados Unidos a precios mas economico, y no aparecen precios de esas lineas aerias... Pero de lo demas es muy Buena!! 👍"
2016,5,Very good. I use Kayak for most of my booking. I wish you could search flights by aircraft model and amenities though.
2016,1,"The newest version of the app no longer searches for flights.     Nexus 5, Android 6.0.1, all requested permissions enabled"
2016,4,"Everything I.go into ""my trips"" and click on my saved trip.  It crashes.  Please fix.  Samsung galaxy s6."
2016,5,"Flexible flight search is new and fantastic! But, hotel search is really basic. Lots results say to call hotel"
2016,4,"Nice app and I like it. I wish the filters were set up a little different than the way they are now where one too many clicks back, and you are all the way back to square one!"
2016,5,Love looking for flights in this app. Super easy. I know I'm getting the best deal!
2016,3,Used to work great and I used this app all the time. Since last update it crashes during search making.it worthless.
2016,5,Used the Kayak app for planning a trip to Texas. It's a fantastic tool! Love how quickly it works:-)
2016,5,Search once and see different offers. Still skeptical of some travel companies but it usually shows ten different options. Simple and fast.
2016,4,I enjoy using this site in desktop mode better than App Mode or on my phone still have a few bugs to work out but overall user friendly
2016,4,I miss some of the functionality-especially filters-found in the Web version. They are limited on the app and I don't know why.
2016,1,Post a ton of underpriced hotels that seem like great deals until you go to book and they hike up the prices.
2016,5,Always shows me the most current info. Never freezes. Great App!
2016,5,I have been using this app for a while now and like the features especially the flight tracker.  No need to spend time at airports when you can track arrivals
2016,4,"I love this app, plus I've found fares/ prices cheaper here than on the airlines and hotels website"
2016,4,I travel a ton so I'm constantly looking for flights. Kayak makes it easy to locate the perfect details fast.
2016,5,I love to use kayak.  It's fast and let me know with the alerts on my phone when prices low  down.
2016,5,I will be happy to organize my travel and lifestyle with you. Thanks for you and your team. Best wishes
2016,1,"Unable to search for flights,each time i make a search it keeps telling me: anonymous access to api denied! This is useless"
2016,5,I plan missions trips and using Kayak makes it easy to find low fares. See if leaving from a different airport could save money and time.
2016,5,Search for Flight and Hotel prices are great with Kayak. Been able to compare competitor's prices all in one place.
2016,5,"I love this app.  I use it everytime I need to travel and it's the best at what it does. It's simple and easy to use, perfect."
2016,5,Mostly works now. Old review: Crashes and limited functions compared to website  Also offline view of saved flights is needed
2016,5,i love it too much... i got everything here when i didn't get in other apk... thanks so much
2016,3,"I used to love this app, great to have everything in one place and you get notified of gate changes before they appear in the airport, but now it crashes frequently and I can't rely on it."
2016,5,"I travel. A lot. Kayak makes it a lot easier. And quite often, less expensive."
2016,5,What's to say. Its like having a friend on the inside. Works for me every time.
2016,1,Title says it all. Samsung Note 5.  It auto selects the same airport for destination as the start. No way to edit it. Uninstalling now.
2016,5,The KAYAK app runs very smooth and quickly. I especially like how it gives you prices from different sources.
2016,5,Faster than their website. Very  Easy to use...recommended.. Enjoy your trip!!!!
2016,1,"Gives you a price, and when you go book it it's another price.. Pricing is wrong! And by a lot..."
2016,3,Doesn't work very well for the flights when you put an infant. The price is not really the good one.
2016,2,Excelent.. I can easily find the price for my flight! Thank you kayak
2016,1,Unusable on my phone and tablet. App will immediately crash as soon as I launch it. Back to TripIt
2016,5,"Just the right level of info in the snapshot, and in the details and displayed at just the right places on the screen! Well thought out!"
2016,1,"This app is awful, it doesn't let you search for packages, and on top of that when you do a search it only gives you 5 or so options with no way to look at more."
2016,1,I'm having a hard time figuring out how to find the best rates.  Not user friendly.
2016,4,The prices on flights are not as competitive as they used to be. They've obviously made a deal with the airlines.
2016,5,I always use Kayak to compare prices for flights. Never booked with them though.
2016,5,Easy to use and finds the best deals. Has saved me money on car rentals and airplane tickets
2016,5,The app works well. Kayak has consistently better prices than anywhere I've looked.
2016,5,"I use kayak for all of my flight purchases. EXCEPT when I fly southwest, wish they included southwest flights but otherwise it's awesome!"
2016,5,Usually comes up with the cheapest flights! Never lets me down.
2016,4,This is a good and very useful app. The functionality of the app is reliable and is easy to understand. Overall I am pleased with it.
2016,5,Love this app for grouping my bookings in one place. Really easy to share trips too
2016,5,"Excellent app thanks, you can get a lot of deals wit flying or hotel stays"
2016,1,"Numerous API errors.  Cleared cache, restarted phone and reinstalled app but the same errors occurred."
2016,1,Does not show the actual fare.  The fare at destination site is higher. Waste of time. Do not use it.
2016,5,Loved booking my flight! Very efficient app and easy to use.
2016,5,Kayak is the only travel app we use!  Never failed us yet for the best rates!
2016,4,It would be even better if it could cross borders and show me Canadian connections...which are closer than other US cities and cheaper
2016,5,Loved it!!! It really helped with planning my trip and it helped to find the cheapest flight
2016,5,I've always received the best prices on flight and car rentals and I find it very easy to navigate.
2016,5,"Love the option to see all destination prices around the world, for the spontaneous exploration trips"
2016,5,It's a powerful tool when you want to know when is the perfect time to buy your flight tickets!
2016,3,The price alert function keeps having errors. And I keep reloading the app.
2016,5,"I use this app all the time. It's easy to use, and finds good deals."
2016,5,Clear layout. Asks the right questions. Love the ease of reading the schedules.
2016,5,Its easy and cheap way to find good deals for hotel and flights
2016,4,A well designed app that I always use when checking airlines and hotels for trips.
2016,1,I just can't seem to get this app to work.  It seems to always say that it can't find the Internet or that it has stopped.
2016,1,Jersey and Guernsey are 2 different islands with (of course) 2 different airports. Why in theworld would you put them together as one in the search engine??????
2016,5,Very useful to find your best flight. Trust me
2016,5,"Flight tracking is most useful, Else information is also essential for booking tickets"
2016,1,Cant even search a flight leaving for an aiport not in my location
2016,4,"Nice filter options let you sort results by arrival or departure time, airline, duration, and a few other things."
2016,5,Works well. Quick and easy way to find great prices.
2016,5,Got me the flight and hotel when I needed to run from the angry husband chasing me down.
2016,4,Great application to find cheap flights and hotels!
2016,5,This is my preferred search engine for travel. I go to kayak first for everything.
2016,5,"Fast, good UI, and indispensable as a trip tracker, keep up the good work!"
2016,5,plan a trip from the airport to the hotel including car rental pretty inclusive app
2016,5,Found the cheapest price for round trip. Amazing app
2018,1,Input dates to search and it gives inaccurate info. Rubbish.
2016,5,Very useful app.  Like it so much.. 😄
2016,5,The explore option can find unbelievable deals for international travel.
2016,5,Works every time! Best rates found on kayak
2016,5,Very useful for finding quick info on affordable flights.
2016,4,Great app for flights but I prefer others for accommodation. Have booked multiple flights through kayak :)
2016,5,"I use kayak to shop for all my airfare, setting alerts is easy & allows me to book my flights when the rates are budget friendly."
2016,4,"If the search options for travel ""Packages"" would be incorporated then I would have given this app a 5 star rating"
2016,3,"It freezes when doing multiple searches, but then it could be my phone, we'll never know"
2016,4,"Good app, gives you lots of choice before you choose to buy just a single flight."
2016,4,This App has greatly improved. All they need now is vacation packages.
2016,5,Great to save trips And check for price changes.
2016,4,"Out on the road, I have found many great deals for a nice motel using Kayak."
2016,4,Could the option for flexible dates (+/- 3 days) be made on the app
2016,4,"The full site has slightly greater functionality, but the mobile site definitely does what you need."
2016,5,Use it for all my trips and never miss a deal!
2016,1,This app doesn't work.  I've reinstalled it and it used to work but doesn't now
2016,4,Good but some aspects could be better. Eaiting for improvement.

2016,5,This is the only one that I use now. So far it's the best.

2016,2,"All I want is to send confirmations and see my itinerary. Sent a complex rail trip. The app bugged me to book a hotel I didn't need. Got the itinerary dates wrong and wouldn't let me fix them on app or web. Had to go through menus to even FIND the (inaccurate) itinerary. Much too complex for its own good,  not to mention my simple needs."
2016,2,"Reasonable app to use to search for hotels in general, but screening/narrowing search is not easy on mobile phone. More frustrating is actually making a reservation thru the app. I was logged into app, sent to ""Tablet"" sight, which told me, after entering all my info, that I already had an account (apparently separate from Kayak). Once I entered email, ""Tablet"" then told me I had to ""activate"" account, sent me an email. By the time I entered new password, I couldn't find the original reservation."
2016,1,"Unable to sign into app via registered email account. The same account works on chrome, but on the app it says my login/password are incorrect. When I try to reset the password, the email states there is no account under that email address. When I signed in through FB, it signed in but stated there was a problem and didn't allow me to progress."
2016,5,"I've never booked flights before but this made it easy to see all the options and customize it to my preferences. It also let's you see the flight price with tax and other fees included so I know exactly what I'm walking into. All the features are nice. Smooth app. Easy to navigate. Extremely helpful. The overall experience is great, you find the best price for flights, hotels.. Whatever, in one area. Thank goodness."
2016,1,"I tried to book a hotel and it gave an error message, I tried again and the same message came again. I checked my card and it charged me twice. The headache is trying to fix it. Multiple phone calls with no guarantee of refund. I've used them many times before, but dare you ask them to fix their mistake!"
2016,4,"I installed this after the last skyscanner release proved less intuitive than previous versions. It is excellent. My only niggle is that I wish you could search from all UK airports to a destination. The only option I can find is 'include nearby airports', which excludes airports I would like to use. As a said- a little niggle for a great app"
2016,3,"It's a good app... Nothing extra ordinary. Hard to put an address to find airports nearby when searching for flights. Here's a couple ideas you may want to pay me for... Put a ""this was price last year at this time and went up/down by your target date."""
2016,4,Phone app better than computer. Wish only that the flight app would allow filtering for non-stop flights from the home page or in settings. It's too important to relegate to a token filter with all others. And it's a hassle to drill down every time I use the app.
2016,1,"What a complete waste of time !! Each time I process my card kayak crashes, with the error  ""kayak has stopped"". Each time I try  I have to  go back in and manually enter my details all over again!  I  will be deleting this garbage and going  with Expedia or Orbitz.  Thanks  for wasting my time Kaykrap!!"
2016,1,"Some glitch wouldn't let me book anything! I kept getting an error message telling me to check my email address. It was the same one I was logged in with. Contacted Kayak twice, was told to try again, then basically told to give up. The rates were great, but they did me no good."
2016,1,"There are plenty of travel apps.  Competition is fierce, but it seems Kayak does not care that others are better.  Where is the overall review score?  It's not in the filter or sort options, and it doesn't show up with the results.  No excuse for that."
2016,5,"Kayak is my favorite place to check for flights, and this app is really easy to use. It lets you change around all kinds of settings to find your best deal. The full desktop website has more features, but this is a really good app"
2016,4,I liked kayak so much for full information. I booked this for New York once. It was work out. However the price should not go up once I confirmed with originally price on the list. I hate tricky lol
2016,1,Used to love it until they made you update your password thru an email link. My email provider spam filter is blocking the email so I can't use site anymore. Bummer.
2016,4,I haven't been able to book anything yet but I'm very pleased so far with the price matching it does and it lets me know whether it's a good time to buy or wait. Saves me the time and hassle of having to shop around on my own :))
2015,4,"UI in accommodation could improve. Wished for flight cheapest scan over months, month as well as already excellent +/- 3 days. This app is almost perfect."
2016,5,"My go-to for all travel coordination. Searches a variety of engines (Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, airline & hotel sites) and compiles best rates.  Really love the Explore function to search destination by price.  Great site, better app, hit the road, let's go!"
2016,5,This app caters to everything I need  from rentals to flights. I'm always able to rely on the confidence option for airline tickets because the app monitors the price fluctuations so that you'll know when they're at or near their lowest point. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who likes or wants to travel.
2016,5,Really simple to plan multi city trips. Most apps won't do that. The app is actually better than the website. Great if you're  like me and need to obsess over your options before purchasing.
2015,5,"My wife and i use it all the time, we have traveled to many places for sometimes, half the price, specially overseas, and good for booking hotels too, sometimes we get good deals even a few hours before we arrive to a place. You have to play a lot with it because prices are going up and down all the time, so you have to be ready and grab them when they go down."
2016,5,"The best travelling app I've seen ... The options ""nearby airports"" and ""nearby dates"" in Flight search are super useful for budget searching .... It would be even better if you can include these two options in the ""multiple-city"" searching..  **UPDATE** Another best feature is Trip management system ... It beats Tripit, Tripcase, and all other programs I have tried in term of text processing power.... Kayak can understand all confirmation emails which the others cannot comprehend .... Great Job!!"
2016,5,So much better than google flights. Gives more options. You can change between classes.. whether it's economy premium economy buisness or first class.. easy to use.. easy to see everything and just fun.
2015,5,"Quick and easy to use. Very versatile! It keeps getting better! One small problem, the trips button on the widget is unable to show the trips that are saved in the full app."
2015,4,I miss the checklist feature for when you're going on trips they already plan out everything you might need an extra. But not taking away from the app performance. Its really dope
2016,5,"I regularly find much better prices than mainstream hotel/flight websites using Kayak, and the Trips function for storing all trip details automatically (including those not booked through Kayak) is brilliant! Top App!!"
2016,2,"""Overwhelmed by too many options?"" Don't worry they'll just remove functionality. First it was packing list, now airport info; this isn't an update, it's a downgrade."
2016,2,Whenever I try to go to the price alert portion of the app it gives me an error. This is the main reason I downloaded the app and I can't even use it? Fail!
2016,5,Love using it always when I travel. Makes life so easy and you get the best deals. I have checked and the price they offer is even less than travel agent prices mainly international.
2016,5,"I almost exclusively use kayak. It helps me decide when to buy, when to wait and when good deals pop up. Takes away the stress of checking airlines!"
2015,1,"I travel a lot and rely on the ""trips"" portion of Kayak. However, version 17 & 18 continually crash when attempting to sign in using my email address."
2016,5,Pretty smooth and accurate. Compared prices to other search engines and moat of the times it has better prices. I like the tab that advice you to wait or buy. Great app!!
2016,5,Super easy to use. I trust this app more than most other similar travel ones. Haven't had any performance issues so far.
2016,4,"This app has all the info you need to get the job done. No frills, no spokes person telling me why they're good, just a good clean app."
2016,5,This app is unbelievable. I have taken multiple flights and ever since downloading this app I will only use Kayak. Prices are upfront. And the site is compatible with most Airlines and other travel sites.
2016,3,App is great but price alert function fails. Otherwise 5 stars. (Samsung 7390)
2016,5,2 Thumbs up. Easy to use and great prices. I travel alot and i always use kayak for booking my flights and hotels.
2016,4,"Kayak is my go to for an initial look at airfares, car rentals, or hotel rates. It provides a fairly comprehensive, easy to use travel search tool."
2016,5,Part of my job description is making airline reservations. This website helps save us money allowing us to travel more and do more. Great app.
2016,5,"Nothing to fault, only just if we can add the boarding pass. BTW don't bother with trip it is very intrusive, kayak is far better"
2016,5,I use this as my foundation. Then I follow the link to the hotel or airline direct site. I get the best prices the majority of the time through Kayak. I occasionally have to use Expedia.
2016,5,I have not used this site yet but there have been days were if I need to help someone get a plan ticket or hotel I show them the prices on this app and this year alone I have checked it and for a trip to canada it's a lot cheaper then what I first thought
2016,5,"Compiles itinerary, books flights and accommodation, offers reviews of places from others, vendor/agent agnostic. What more do you want?"
2016,5,"I've used Kayak for years and although, as a seasoned and regular traveler, I have other apps for flights, hotels etc., Kayak is my default and 90% of the time the app I end I end up using to make bookings."
2016,4,"Quick searches, easy to use interface.  Appears to find the best prices.   Easy to read and search."
2016,4,"Easy to use. Not happy that it rated a flight as wait with confidence, then when it went up $88 if changed the flight to buy."
2016,5,"Bestapp ever- forget skyscanner, yes you will find cheaper flights on skyscanner,but they are scams.kayak filters out the scammers and leaves the trustworthy airlines and 3rd party services up. Using kayak in conjunction with airfare watchdog alerts your chances of getting a nice flight rate are excellent! Just landed a roundtrip airfare to New York $190!"
2016,1,"This app directs you to third party websites that gives you a price and after all your flight and credit card information is filled out, when you try to pay the agreed price, they inflates the  cost substantially. In my case it was about 50% more."
2016,5,"This is a great app, I would definitely recommend this to people especially if you flight often.  I've been using this for a couple years now, never let me down. It's awesome."
2016,4,Very useful app. Great to get best prices for travel. Love alerts for price changes.
2016,3,"Overall the app works well, but it does occasionally stop working and crash. Bugs need to be worked out."
2016,1,I just downloaded this app so I could book my ticket for my trip next week and I can't do anything I pick one and then it tells me the page can't be found really I hope you can fix this asap or I will be deleting and finding another one have have screen shots of what it doing but of course there ain't a place here to put them
2016,4,I was able to use quite a bit of filters to sort through the options.  Time of day is more important to me than the date of my travel
2016,4,Great app. Searches well and other useful tools too. Packing list is handy.
2015,5,"Well designed, easy to use and the best prices I could find. I really like the trends feature that approximates the likelihood of price increases."
2016,1,Uninstalled  slider for prices is a joke. High to low settings impossible to find. Hust did not work. Waste of space.
2016,1,"Charge one price on line, hotel charge different price. Don't even bother with site. Best to call Hotel."
2016,5,It is easy to use. Best prices online. Sometimes once you find the cheapest one you can go to their website and save even more with promo codes.
2016,4,Much better version. Can be even better if filters could be pre-selected before search happens.
2016,5,Love Kayak service since it launched. This App is even greater with great user interface and pretty much bug free
2016,5,"There's no other as good!. Love the Explore option. Wish the were alerts for the Explore option, like send me an alert for all tickets under $350 from my departure airport."
2016,1,You can't even check your upcoming  reservations on the app. That makes it useless l. Better off just using the website.
2016,5,"Same day deep discounts on hotels, low airfares. Better than other popular apps and sites!"
2016,5,Great to use. Best prices. I just wish flights listed when they arrived a day later.
2016,5,Fantastic UI. Don't need a travel agent. Very convenient. Great deals
2016,4,Always found lower fares than the airlines themselves. Wish it had more of the detailed gratis that the full website does such as doing a+/- 3 day calendar of fares.
2016,5,Been using for a long time. Have tried other travel search engine. This is still my preference.
2016,3,"Doesn't have all the filter details that i need so i have to visit the website. Also, should list customer reviews in star format as well."
2016,5,"Site is great, able to get great prices, store your info, purchase is quick, can see your future flights. Nice job!"
2016,5,This app is amazing!!! Not only does it find the cheapest way to make your trip more affordable it also has special discounts for using this app on your mobile device. Keep it up kayak!!!!
2016,5,Love. Love. Love. Love this app! It is my go-to app to find the cheapest flights and hotels. I have tried others and this one rocks!
2016,5,I only use Kayak for finding flights when I travel. It's a very fast and reliable search engine that has accurate estimates for flights and very user friendly.
2016,5,"This app is awesome, I have flight information on the tip of my fingers. Thank you Kayak!! Five stars!!!"
2016,5,"I'll see weird bugs once in a while when you try to cook multiple rooms, but nothing that'll stop me from not using this app. Still the best around imo."
2016,5,Love this app! Have saved so much buying ticket through this app. Thank you kayak!!!
2016,5,So far love it! Compared to others feels easier to navigate and was around $20 cheaper on some flights
2016,5,Kayak is my only choice for coordinating rates and flights. The app is simple to use and has never given me issue.
2016,5,"App seems cools when I scheduled flight had small issue with airfare customers support , but the follow-up from app is awesome"
2016,5,Easy to use and offers great deals! Kayak is my go to for the best prices on flights.
2016,5,Love the explore feature that quotes cheap flights from your chosen locale. App seems to run smooth.
2016,3,Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because there's no way to get rid of the hotels that want you to call for a rate SUPER ANNOYING
2016,4,"I love this app great prices on whatever I'm looking for from Hotels Rooms, to Rental Cars to Flights"
2016,5,"I always use it to find the best flight,  hotel, and car rental....whenever i want, or need to escape..."
2016,5,I'm always finding a great deal with kayak and user friendly! Great app :)
2016,4,"I have used Kayak for three years, using it to plan several vacations which would have challenged an experienced travel agent (which is why I do it myself)."
2015,5,This is good software design.  Never had a problem figuring out how to do stuff in the user interface.
2016,5,Works more quickly than website.  Haven't found any deficiencies yet....more later.
2016,4,Good app. I use it as a starting point for faster comparisons. Sometimes search results are a body slow to appear.
2016,4,My starting point for every travel search. Remarkably bug-free.
2016,5,Kayak is yet to let me down. The app works as intended and doesn't falter.
2016,5,$634 round trip from New York to Seoul. I was able to book quickly through the app.
2016,5,Very easy with a fast and useful interface.   Works perfectly on a Galaxy S6.
2016,5,Great app to search hotels and flights. Very easy to use!
2016,5,Easy & fast. Offers you nothing but the lowest rates. Love it for booking flights at anytime!
2016,5,Always gives me the best deal. Gives me flights for United and I'm a member over yander.
2015,1,"App monitors your phone id, call data, and contacts!!!  Why??? What are you doing??? These perms are NOT required for app function!!!"
2016,5,To use as a benchmark and to help you find flights and hotels. Use it every day.
2016,5,Prefer this over the full website. Has always worked fine for me. This is my 1st stop travel site. Pricing is accurate.
2016,5,"It provides the cheapest fares, also other information in the application are very helpful, like flight tracker, etc."
2016,5,It finds me cheap flights. I never have problems and I use it all the time.
2016,2,Can't book a multi stop flight. It doesn't show any option to add more flights after the first even though multi stop is selected.
2016,1,Website allows you to search a range of days. App does not. Dumb.
2016,3,With the update the airline alliances  selection has been removed. That's a bummer.
2016,5,Good travel app...works great on a SAMSUNG GALAXY S5.
2015,5,"One stop for booking or pricing everything. Love the fact they don't add on fees for themselves, they show you the prices and let you do the rest."
2016,1,"I searched for flights, app first showed a fair price, when I click to choose, linked me to a website that real price was high. I have to uninstall it."
2016,5,"So easy to use. Love trip management functionality, too."
2016,5,"Very easy to use, shows aaalllll the information needed and it has the best prices!"
2016,5,Works great! Got some great rates for a hotel and rental car.
2016,5,Easily better than any other travel app. Love it
2016,5,Every trip we've taken we use kayak. Never had a problem.
2016,4,"Easy to use on tablet and phone, great trip planning tool."
2016,5,Very easy to use and search. Doesn't crash. Has 1 job & does it well.
2016,4,التطبيق جيد لاخذ فكرة عن الاسعار . و سيئ انه غير فعال لعمل الحجز و الشراء . اي يحولك الى موقع بيع اخر . اضافة لذلك من سيأته انه يوجد بعض خطوط الطيران لا يعرضها و بالتحديد الاقتصادي . بس هو ممتاز لعرض الرحلات المتوفرة بشكل دقيق
2016,5,Yup..great travel app. Easy to use
2016,3,Great app and always use it but I can't sign in still as it keeps crashing. Any help would be great.
2016,5,Works Awesome. ..best travel search app!
2016,5,I almost always use this app to find flights. Great filters and versatility.
2016,5,I use kayak whenever I book travel.  The app is easy to use while on the go.
2015,4,Works as it should and has better deals most of the time
2016,5,This app works without any problem. It deserves five star.
2016,5,KAYAK starts all of my web search for flights.  It is easy and convenient.
2016,5,Kayak makes traveling so much easier and affordable. Great app too! :)
2016,1,"Wants phone access ( phn no. I'd and SMS access ) user account access , camera access ?? Why ??"
2015,4,Doesn't always have the lowest prices. Easy to use very helpful
2016,5,Very handy to find deals and everything you need for your trips!
2015,4,User friendly interface. Quick response
2016,4,I find myself looking for flights more then ever. Don't get this if you are an impulsive vacationer
2015,1,Crashes when I try to sign in with my email address. Didn't work.
2016,5,I always use kayak when traveling. Always has the best prices.
2016,4,* minus the grid like price/date overview. Which is what I like about kayak the most.
2016,5,Great app to help planning a trip.  Use it frequently.
2016,2,Ever since getting acquired by Priceline its ability to search for the cheapest flights has been going downhill.
2016,2,"Latest version does not allow email sign in, crashes every time."
2016,1,It shows the lowest prices and when you try to book it the prices go up and no I'm not talking about taxes.
2016,2,No possibility of moving to the SD card.  For me that's a mistake
2015,2,Kayaks cheapest round trip to Maui was $200.00 more than a simple Google search.
2015,4,Great app for fast fare finder. No long delay in getting results
2016,5,Great deals no issues on Samsung note 4😊
2016,1,"When you get ready to purchase and enter all your info after hiring the purchase button, it hangs then freezes"
2016,4,"I like kayak all the time. Like that it's simple to use, a lot of options and easy to use and purchase from them."

2016,5,Gives excellent information of which I am satisfied. Thanks

2015,4,"Good app sometimes the prices are different then what's offered, not happy about that!"
2015,4,Easy to navigate and fast response. I would recommend it to others!
2016,1,It had a pop up asking for a review. I hate pop ups hence the 1 star review.
2016,5,It works pretty well. It serves its purpose
2016,5,I really love this app. Great job! :)
2016,4,They should be easier to pick and choose i dont like hitting back 2 times to resume my search
2015,3,"The more I'm nagged to review, the lower my rating will be."
2016,5,Excellent customer service. ..flexible when traveling
2016,1,The buy with confidence doesn't show up. Tried everything.
2016,4,"Very helpful but does not show all the airlines, like Southwest..."
2016,5,"Esta aplicación es una de más más confiables que he usado , tanto en seguridad como en ofertas. He podido reservar hoteles en cuestión de horas y vuelos con muy buen precio la recomiendo al 100%"
2016,4,Doesn't seem to have all the filters that the website has but it's a great app!
2016,1,No available cars as displayed and a higher prices than listed in the first page.
2016,4,I am able to look up flights quickly while overseas when my data is limited to 128kbps.

2016,5,I've been using this for a while and so far it always comes up with the best prices... I love it!
2016,4,Easy to use but I don't think it includes Southwest flight
2016,5,"Allows for all options of flying, haven't found an airport that it doesn't list. Love the best fare option!"
2016,4,Wish I could filter by total journey duration and erase some airports from my search history
2015,4,Was fantastic & very efficient. Now or just constantly crashes.
2015,5,"Great app, easy to use. I use it always to book flights when I head out of town."
2015,5,Always a great app for last minute planners. Probably even more useful for those who do!
2016,5,No other search needed. I always find exactly what I am looking for!
2016,5,Excellent navigation and information.  Wish they could include southwest flights for improved use.
2015,4,On point ... daily notifications of cheaper fares is extremely good

2015,4,It's more convenient  than  surfing the web.
2016,4,This app works great and makes shopping for flights a breeze.

2016,5,Muy bueno
2016,5,Like the app
2016,5,Mr fisher
2016,5,Travel finder
2015,4,"Good app, saved me at least $10 or more each time I traveled and needed a Hotel that night compared to others. But I like the option of the map view on the website that shows where each Hotel is around a specific place so I could plan accordingly but through the app. Also does not have the option of ""book now, pay later"" like another app that I know I can secure a spot and pay at the hotel and not online for security reasons. Scale of 1-5 stars 4, scale of 1-10, 8.8."
2015,5,"I tried several travel apps including TripIt and Flightview and decided I liked Kayak best. It's a great app, easy to use, easy to edit to correct or add details. Just forward your reservation emails and it automatically creates a trip itinerary for you, which synchs across your devices. Kayak also allows you to easily search for lowest cost rental cars. Good UI. I'm using a Google Nexus 6P phone. I recently was having trouble with Kayak crashing on my phone when I clicked on ""My Trips."" However, I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and now it's working fine."
2015,4,"This is hands down my most used travel app. Not only do I use it to book and manage my own travel plans, but also to keep track of the plans of friends and family who might be visiting or who I might need to pick up or drop off at the airport! One thing is like to see in a future update is for a quick way to move flights from My Trips into Flight Tracker. I think a past version used to do that, but the current version doesn't seem to have a direct link."
2015,1,"I've been searching for a specific flight daily for the past two weeks, every single time kayak displays a reasonably priced option, it turns out to be substantially more expensive (around $300 more!?) once redirected to the purchase page. This unfortunately makes the app virtually useless and I now need to find a different functioning app."
2015,1,I like the kayak website but even though I'm logged in on the app I just get errors about anonymous access to API not allowed. So useless error to a user... And right now useless app.
2015,3,I love this app and suppose to give it five star...  but I believe there is one disadvantage to be avoided to get that star.. I can't specify if the passenger is adult-senior-infant-or child and that cause price difference that should be avoided.. please Solve that issue so I can rely on the app without the need of website
2015,5,Loaded at least 6 other aps and this one by far has the most flight info!!!!  Also shows southwest where most do not.  You need to go to SW website to get pricing but at least u can see the flights.  Wish they had the pricing maps like others or predictability.
2015,5,"The app only does what you expect it to. Sure, there are lots of options app-wise to find a good deal when travelling, but I like Kayak's app because it's simple. No constant notifications or upselling. I just use it when I need it, and it works as expected."
2015,4,Good apps... but this app show only economy class.. Business class.. First class.. But their is no option for defence person like as defence kota...so please enter also a class for defence person
2015,1,"I cannot believe so many people use it. No matter what flight you choose, prices go up right after you press ""Book now"". Price rises 30% in seconds. ""Magically""."
2015,3,Not as efficient as one on the computer. It should have had +-3 days and grid options. It is not that hard to out it for software engineers. It could have been better.
2015,3,"While making flight reservation, it only gives how many passengers.. It doesn't gives you..  Adult or children or Infant..  It kind of sucks..  Couldn't see the exact price for travel.. While travelling with kids.."
2015,4,"Great for unstructured trip uploads. Sync with Outlook isn't great. Creates a read only all day event which is only a link to the site. Better than Tripit, Tripcase and Worldmate"
2015,4,"I love this app and always check out first when checking travel prices (hotels, plane tickets, etc). Download it... You can't go wrong !"
2015,5,I travel internationally and domestically within the US and China and this has been hands down the best app yet! Its great for flights and accommodations! And shows better rates than some other apps I have tried.
2015,4,"Kayak is a great app for finding hotels and flights, very professional. But unfortunately they dont have any reward program, i have been using it a lot over the last 7 years and i never get any reward."
2015,4,"Great app quick travel reservations with various options. Love it, happily using this for a while..."
2015,5,Simple UI and offers quick comparison. Have been using this over years now. Highly recommended.
2015,4,Love this app. I only wish it had the option to do the 3 days ahead and after like the website does.
2015,5,I've used Kayak website for years and the app works equally well.  Have never had a problem with it at all.
2015,5,I use kayak for all my flights. I've always gotten the best prices and their interface is very easy to use!
2015,5,I use Kayak literally on a daily basis.  We plan trips months ahead and Kayak continually scours websites looking for the best deals and reporting back daily.
2015,4,Kayak has been the number one app used when I travel since my last review. I have made over 7 trips and have alerts for 3 more over the last 6 months.
2015,5,I  fly often and this is a great app for researching flights.  I'd like if it had notification settings for deals from my home city.
2016,5,"Fast,  simple, user-friendly, it has all the features I need,  at the same time - not too much"
2015,4,The Kayak app makes for a great travel tool and assistant while on the road.  I love it!
2015,5,I have used this app for the past year and tried others for cheap prices. Kayak always finds the best deals.
2015,5,"The apps work great, it has a good details on travel options, for those who wants a great deals with airlines and hotels....."
2015,5,"Just as the title says, really. Kayak has always been my favorite travel aid to begin with, and this app provides all the necessary functionality to get you where you need to go, CHEAP!"
2015,5,"By far the best flight researching and booking tool. Easily filter by airline, arrival time an departure time."
2015,5,Best app. Only thing that could make it better if you could select a country and if would show you all the flights going in from around the world cheapest to dearest 😄
2015,4,Great deals all the time.Thanks for providing wonderful deal all the time I'm looking for a rental car.
2015,5,"I like being able to quickly check fares and rental car prices.  In fact,  I have used the app to rent a different car while standing in line for a different company."
2015,5,"Must app for a traveler, whether you are searching for a flight ticket, booking a hotel or comparing prices with different travel websites; quite fast and dependable."
2015,5,I'm constantly using the app to find the best flight options. I'm on here a few times a week.
2015,5,I love to search for things on here!  So many options and the confidence percentage is fantastic!
2015,5,I personally use kayak and momondo... both of are very useful in finding cheap and great deals
2015,5,Booked multiple trips with ease and cheaper than on airline specific websites. I can also track flights. The alerts are a plus!
2015,5,It gives me good prices on everything when i look up places i want to go to but with 1-2 months in advance the only thing i dont like when i buy plane tickes from one day to another they are price but thats on me planing on the last minute but other than that is a great app to plan a trip
2015,3,"Great but doesn't include the some applicable airlines for Asia, Africa and South America. Was not as useful because of this."
2015,5,User-friendly. Can pay securely with google wallet.
2015,5,Brings out the best deals every time. Simply the best app in this space.
2015,3,Fare alerts rarely work and don't notify. Overall confusing and hard to use.
2015,5,This is the most useful app for me since I travel so often for work!  Thank you
2015,5,This ia a well done app. I use it as the first option for any travel need.
2015,5,The best way to find tickets! And I travel a lot. Go to website when flying
2015,5,Easy to use. Results in a bit. Cool and smart app! Love it
2015,5,I always find what I need! Great app and wonderful user experience!
2015,5,Getting  all the lovely  features  of the website within the app without compromising user experience  is brilliant.
2015,1,Will make it 5 stars if u put paypal and u stop increasing the original price with 20$ for u own profit
2015,4,Covers SOOO much. Explore tool is awesome.
2015,1,"Great, when it works... Never connects when you need it too."
2015,5,I love this app. Kayak always has great deals
2015,3,It's no worse than any of the travel sites I've used recently but it's far from what I imagine a travel app *could* be.
2015,4,Quickly sifts out what your searching for . I always use this app. Its great try it.
2015,5,I like the app. It shows best deals and comfortable in use.
2015,5,Best prices and options. Easy to use and fast
2015,4,"Saves alot of time, an all-inclusive kindda app. Very good!!"
2015,5,Fantastic app. Love the trip calendar feature.
2015,4,Ease of use and speed are 5/5 gets a 4.5/5 overall as it misses some major cities that are otherwise represented.
2015,5,It saved me on some last minute travel changes!!! LOVE IT! Keep it guys!!
2015,5,"It does the job. For multi city trip to Europe from US, i save alot of money by finding the trip on Kayak App."
2015,5,Good app so far! Really helpful to get the best flight...
2015,4,It's really easy to navigate and has some nice features that are very useful.
2015,5,"Easy to use, best prices, superior set up. Love Kayak!"

2015,5,It's very easy and usually give the best to the consumer. I 'll continue using it.
2015,5,I'm constantly checking out flights. Nice to have this easy go to app.
2015,5,I've done three international backpacking trips and I always use kayak for flights! No one else is cheaper!!!
2015,5,I love all the filters I can apply to my searches. It helps me have complete control of my travels
2015,5,App really gets you the cheapest rate! My go to app since yesterday.

2015,5,...then it would be almost perfect.  Wish the app could show more +/- days.
2015,5,"Mobile friendly. Easy to use, great for multi trip bookings."
2015,5,App rocks for quick scans on price comparisons.   Must have app!
2015,5,I use this app all the time.  Better than Momondo and other sites
2015,4,It's long-term a little bit to finish booking
2015,5,Finding flights and hotels is a breeze and their professional demeanor is a welcome change for the weary road worrier who needs a stress purge.
2015,5,"Everything you need is here - accommodation, flights, etc. Never had any problems with its system either."
2015,5,Great app.  I really like how it catalogues my trip histories.
2015,4,This is a convenient way to shop for fares. I like it!

2015,5,Traje
2015,5,Me encanta
2016,5,Ottima app
2015,5,"thanks to this app, I was easily able to monitor plane ticket prices so I could buy when the time was right. so much less hassle than trying to look up prices on the computer! Normally I don't do app reviews,  but this one was a no brainer."
2015,4,"It would be nice to be able to sort out kid friendly, pet friendly hotels with pools. I have to look at each hotel versus using the sort option available on the full site. I can only sort by how many stars the hotel has."
2015,5,Love the App! Would suggest having easier functionality to accessing each leg of round-trip options. It takes a while to get to the desired leg1 and leg2 combo you desire. I find it easier to search for each leg separately.
2015,5,Better than simply searching multiple other apps and sites. Simpky puts ALL options available filtered and asorted by your choosing. Nice job guys : )
2015,5,"If you thought the website was great, wait until you try the app! Trip management, travel research and filters, shared flight notifications, automated email parsing, itinerary documentation... You name it!"
2015,5,"Great app easy to use, has a permanent place on my phone. Haven't tried booking yet so can't comment as far as that goes"
2015,5,Booked flight with zero problems. Found great information on rental cars and hotels too....I am adding on to the original review because of how pleased I am with this app. I got up to minute emails regarding date changes are in the other potential changes that occurred on my trip. Super pleased with his app!
2015,4,Would have given it a 5 star but in needs one thing. Thats to have flexible date for air travel or hotel. Showing the prices for several  dates help find a cheapest ticket.
2015,3,Especially when looking for flights. Too many times it upped the price upon ordering while claiming that the cheapest one exhausted.  Few minutes later it gave that exhausted price again and upped it again upon order. I call that Ch@@@ing
2015,2,The app crashes every time I open it after logging in with my account via Facebook. Now I can't use the app...
2015,1,Price alert didnt work! Probably after the update. I've lost 100$ on a cheaper flight.
2015,5,"Wonderful app. It makes planning trips and buying tickets very easy for me. I especially like the price alert as I can monitor the prices for anticipated travel plans. Moreso, being able to compare many airlines and agents. Awesome app."
2015,4,Overall is an excellent app and provides great prices. I wish it's interface provided more/easier search  variable options
2015,5,"I have booked multiple flights,cars,hotels with this app. No issues so far. I love kayak because of the flight predicting... I've waited till it said buy and saved $150!"
2015,4,"Got a good deal to DC to see my sister who I haven't seen since she got stationed back to the US. Had no problem with checking in, boarding, etc. Will use Kayak again!!"
2015,5,"Great application. Very flexible. Still great, wish it would let me get to Southwest but I guess that's not their call."
2015,5,"What else can you ask for, this has almost every options possible within the app..this and cheapoair are the best ive tried....kayah is just loaded with alot more options and cheap hotels and motels to save money."
2015,5,Not an exhaustive search but definitely narrows it down. Great tool in hunting for the right flight
2015,5,"Makes my travel plans that much easier. User friendly, & my best travel friend"
2015,5,Fantastic tool. Keep adding more functionality to rival the web based abilities.
2015,5,Just saved 150.00 using Kayak.  The app works well and the site is amazing.
2015,5,This is easy to use. But I'm not sure how easy it will be to actually purchase the tickets. But we will see.
2015,5,"Because of this app I can visit my boyfriend who is in the military a few states away, with very little trouble. Kayak is my go to trip advisor :)"
2015,5,"I have been using Kayak for well over 3 years, no complain whatsoever. Most of my travel plans are finalized here"
2015,1,"I've searched for some flight tickets and from the advertised price 262£ it ""transformed"" at the checkout for 341£ ... rubbish"
2015,5,Makes it so easy to buy tickets online and if there's any problems all the numbers to call the airline directly are 1 click away.
2015,5,"Kayak is awesome! I especially love the ""Explore""option!"
2015,5,Very good experience with this app. Highly recommend. I travel  frequently
2015,4,I would rate it 5 star if u correct the slowness issue in booking online.  There is a lot of delay in connecting sites.
2015,4,"Would like to be able to search +/- a day or two like on the website, but otherwise it's great"
2015,5,This app has never crashed [knocks on wood] and has been my go-to flight finder for ALL my trips for the last year!
2015,4,It does what you'd think. No crashes so far
2015,4,"Quick ticket information, wish it included smaller airlines, but I use kayak all the time."
2015,4,Takes a while to load and should be able to edit results with filters whilst waiting for all results to cone through.
2015,5,Kayak has turned out a very polished and clean app that does the job for simple requests! Highly recommended!
2015,5,Used about 10 different sites looking for plane tickets.  Kayak beat them all hands down on prices.
2015,4,As of now only using for flight reservations but very user friendly
2015,4,Got to an from my destination on time no troubles i will continue to use thisapp
2015,5,"I love this app. I rely on it for quickly checking prices on multiple items, such as flight and hotel cost."
2015,5,"You put in the information that you want, when you want it and it finds what you want. I think this app is awesome!!"
2015,5,I just love that they show the cheapest flight out there..but i just hope they improve the explore section cuz its kinda buggy
2015,5,An easy to use app which provides almost everything you need. Partnered with a quick look at trip advisor and you are set.
2015,5,Best first stop for flights. I suggested a change and they were responsive.
2015,5,Just wish Southwest would allow kayak to show their rates. Not a ding on kayak just poor marketing on Southwest part
2015,4,Only complaint is the limited # of airlines but not in their control
2015,5,"I was a flight attendant for Northwest Airlines for 12 years, and kayak is by far the easiest way to find the cheapest  flights!!"
2015,5,I buy all my flights through this app and its never done me wrong.
2015,4,good app        easy to use when you're in a emergency
2015,5,Good app my friends circle love it...easy to use. .
2017,5,You near not to think? Good Result will be there on the TOP of  it !!!!!
2015,5,"It's best app for purchase air tickets, hotel booking and many more"
2015,5,A super app that enables you to get best deals for your next excursion.
2015,5,"Great for flights, hotels, and keeping track of trip itineraries."
2015,5,I love being able to go to one site to do my travel searches.
2015,5,"Its fast,simple and it gets you some good deals on airline ticket prices"
2015,5,Works great bought really cheap tickets out of the country!
2015,5,Easy to use and my go to when I need plane tickets or a hotel.
2015,5,"Easy to use, and best of all good prices!"
2015,5,Easy to use.  Likes that it saves cities I've searched.
2015,5,All the features of the website on your phone
2015,5,I hate having to reenter info on other sites. This one keeps it ready.
2015,5,Does what it's supposed to do...save you time and money. I dig it!

2015,5,Excelente aplicación
2015,5,Luuvvveee it
2015,5,البرنامج روعه
2015,3,"I am using a galaxy s5. These are the cheapest prices I've seen for my international flights this year. However, the loading animation and live results don't really work; I'm basically entering my query and lagging until all results appear. It doesn't intefere with the service, but it keeps this application from being the obvious choice in booking apps."
2015,4,"I always compare prices on different sites and so far this one was the bet for flights. Phone app works fine, very handy to have it at your fingertips and keep checking throughout the day. Would be nice if it remembered my time preferences, not just dates."
2015,4,"Using Galaxy edge, and app notifications /alerts do not work. However email alerts  work great.   Please fix."
2015,5,Easy to plan your trip!  Fast and cheaper than going directly to airlines.  Insurance coverage is less with Kayak so do your planning right here right now.
2015,5,Greatest Travel app. So smooth and best filter options. Super fast! Keep it up.
2015,3,Your mobile application shows higher prices than the web with the same search. Please correct it as soon as possible thanks
2015,5,"A great means to obtain comparable air fares, hotel rates, and rental car costs in most markets worldwide. Makes the murky world of airline pricing more transparent, which is no doubt why some airlines curse its existence!"
2015,5,The only missing option is the automatic email scanner. BlackBerry Travel did thia well.
2015,2,Priceline is way cheaper for hotels (almost half the price). Not sure about other aspects of travel as I only book hotels.
2015,5,Love the ability to receive notification when flights drop in price. Easy to use and navigate
2015,5,Only wish they would include a copy of the email I sent to their trip management so I could easily verify travel information without going back to my mail app
2015,4,"Other full site features should be added, like type of traveler ( Adult, child) and others."
2015,4,"Is very easy to use, easy to navigate through. Will recommend to friends and family."
2015,2,Gives you better options for returns (on round-trip flights) that's what I saw.
2015,4,"Missing some filter options vs the desktop site, but pretty good."
2015,4,I really like this app for preliminary plans - especially the  price watch feature.
2015,3,But it doesn't have some low cost airlines like Jazeera Airways
2015,5,"Great app, I have traveled several times to Europe and Mexico all done with Kayak and always worked perfect!"
2015,5,I trust kayak for my flight bookings for detailed flights & comparing prices. Very helpful
2015,5,I use this app for most of my travels.  Its so easy to check a price that I probably use it every day!
2015,5,Love this app.. the best prices as you can find and enjoy it!
2015,5,I've only used it for vehicle rentals so far. It's quick and finds really great rates.
2015,4,Great ui. Fast. Easy.
2015,5,"I use Kayak all the time, the Price alerts are very nice, I was able to snatch some amazing fares!"
2015,4,"Trains are missing, but app is awesome!"
2015,4,Could do with auto linking into the recommended suppliers.
2015,4,Kayak.   Makes booking so much easier
2015,5,Kayak helped me find a 58$$ round trip flight!!!!! It was easy to use.
2015,5,"I use this app on a weekly basis, its easy to navigate and saves me time and money."
2015,5,This app has been great for keeping all of my trip details in one place
2015,5,"Just like kayak's desktop web, the app is also super fast and user friendly"
2015,3,"Great app to book hotels, flights, rentals...."
2015,5,The app is exactly what is says it is a quick way to find travel prices from available carriers.
2015,5,Cheap flights and easy transactions will definitely use Kayak again.
2015,5,Finds the best prices out of all the other apps!
2015,5,"Easy to navigate, intuitive, buy tickets with confidence."
2015,5,Great way to check multiple flights from different sites.
2015,5,More intuitive to use than even the pc version.
2015,4,Very nice application for booking tickets to fly
2015,5,Love it I always fine great deals thanks kayak!!!
2015,5,Really it's giving you the best offers always
2015,5,This is a simple app that is easy to use and does what it claims.
2015,3,Its so perfect. Wow
2015,5,Super comprehensive travel booking app.
2015,4,Quick and super easy love the prices
2015,4,Its better than other apps

2015,5,Convenient and cheap
2015,5,Love this app
2015,5,Always helpful
2015,5,Good app
2015,4,Works as it should
2015,5,All my travel research starts with Kayak!
2015,5,Everything in one
2015,5,Love it
2015,5,I use it every time I fly and sometimes when I don't
2015,3,Slow sometimes
2015,5,Nlcee
2015,1,Had to download the app several times before getting it to recognize me then maneuvering through the app was not intuitive at all. Very poorly architected app. Might need to start from scratch Kayak. The website works well from my computer... wth?
2015,4,"Kayak is a great app, and the UX is second to none, but one still needs to be careful: I sometimes get cheaper/better tickets on other sites and apps, namely Chipmunk, Skyscanner and Flight Matrix. However, Kayak is nearly always the same or better... An essential app for anyone who flies."
2015,5,I have only booked my flights kyak. It's simple and they show me the deals in a range of dates that could work. Cud use more festurs but I definitely say give it a try
2015,1,Attempted to make same day reservation.  The date changed in booking process.  I realized this after receiving confirmation email. CSR refused to modify date but would cancel and rebook for additional fee.
2015,5,"The app found cheaper tickets in a different website. It sent me to Sky Fares and they offered me cheaper price than Kayak and cheapoair and also gave me free cancelation if I call within 12 hours from the time I booked the ticket. I was blown away when it did this. Like I mean, who does that? Send customers to a cheaper site if Kayak is too expensive. A really good company, that's who."
2015,5,"She used kyak twice to book trips to Thailand, both times went very smoothly. Even after the airline changed my flight, the booking agent help fix my issue...with a flight that was better than the original. We will definitely be repeat customers!"
2015,4,Nice app i do most of my ticket reservations through it but sometimes  when i come to the actual booking or placing the order price changing even if i book instantly.. this is the only part i don't like
2015,5,"used this o get a feel of the prices and have them send me a daily  update on prices. then i go direct to the airline, website"
2015,5,"...still the bomb. (September 2015)                                 My rating on April 8, 2014: Loved it... ...waay before it was an app! :-)"
2015,5,"Easy to use, gives a lot of info and its pretty quick.  Been using kayak for years now. Never had a complaint"
2015,5,"Always loved this app. It's great for planing trips, and findings great deal patterns."
2015,5,Helps me obtain the cheapest tickets around.  I love it...  Recommended for anyone in need of airline tickets
2015,4,"Works great, help when trying to find hotel options"
2015,3,Don't stare blind on this app!!!!!! Sometimes some airlines don't show up even though they fly the selected route!!!! Be aware!!!
2015,4,Can't add a baby when searching on the app. Also get different results on the app versus online.
2015,5,I use it almost exclusively. Best travel app! A+++
2015,4,"I always use Kayak to find flights, rental cars and hotels. It is a quick way to find the best prices."
2015,2,Doesn't give terminal number at Heathrow Shame the new version is useless to me without it
2015,4,The best feature is their ability to combine two different one way fares with different carriers to save money.
2017,1,This Android app was wonderful and then they upgraded it and now it's completely useless.
2015,4,"Sometimes I can get better options with the airlines, but this is much better than most sites."
2015,5,This is my go-to app for all things travel. Love it!
2015,4,Cannot save search or alerts. It keeps giving and unexpected error.
2015,5,Helps me find best fares and rates. I have used it for years.
2015,4,"My go to app for buying airplane tickets, never i was not satisfied"
2015,5,"Love that they compare so many airlines, the ability to check multiple airports and forecast price changes."
2015,5,I have been doing a lot of unexpected traveling lately and I don't know what I would have done without Kayak!
2015,5,"Very helpful, could use side notes on hints and suggestions for alternate routes closest to destination."
2015,5,"Works well, easy to use, no complaints here."
2015,5,Kayak is priceless for a major traveling business guy like me.
2015,5,"This app is solid, it never crashes and the interface is well organized."
2015,5,This user friendly app makes planning your trip easy.
2015,5,Has saved my butt more than once.
2015,5,Cheapest.  I've tried 8 and this is really good.

2018,2,"I can't set the filters to save them with the searches. I found navigating and bookmarking flight options clunky. Can't search for flights leaving during a two day period. I realize these are more ""advanced"" features, but why install an app if it does nothing more than a website? (Except to harass you with more push notifications)"
2015,4,It still gets the job done but I've started finding better deals elsewhere and more flights. Seems like they got too popular and are becoming less competitive. The hotel search is still good. It's right up there with the best apps for travel but a lot of times the links will not go to the deal that they offered on the website the price will change to a higher price once you choose it and it sends you to the other website.        Don't use Hotwire at all. Total scam. Should not even be part of the search.
2015,1,"Sorry Kayak, but the new privacy permissions you want now with personal information and other contact info has gone to far.  -- Update Aug 2015 same terrible permissions, Kayak you're going to be in trouble with the new Google OS coming out. Oh and stop paying for 5 star reviews."
2015,4,"I have been traveling a lot by air and Kayak has helped me find some great deals in flights, hotels and cars. I like their fair tracker option as it makes me aware of price drops or increased. So far no problems."
2015,5,"I'm in the army stationed in hawaii, when I went to go home to Chicago this past week I had great flights through united. My flight there was direct and the timing was great, my way back I had a 10 hour layover in LA which was cool, I got to check out the city. I looked everywhere for flights and the cheapest I could find was $1200 and I'd have a layover each way, with kayak it was $800. Thanks for letting me spend more time with my family, check out a great city, and save me $400 kayak"
2015,5,This is the best app I ever encountered. It's super easy layout help you get what you want to fast. One of My favorite thing is the flight trend. You can see based on patterns when the fare would be lowest. Also the buy/wait percentage that appears when buying flights.
2015,5,"I have been using Kayak to plan and book spontaneous trips for years and it has always been a convenient app/website that puts all the best deals in one spot. Try it out if you haven't already! To quote Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation, ""Son, an endorsement from me is basically a guarantee."""
2015,1,"Apparently while trying to fetch ads. Mind it, if either ad blocking or kayak has to go, it is going to be the kayak that gets dumped. Same happens on my other device, too. Still applies to the latest version!!!!"
2015,4,NEEDED A TIX FOR MY AUNT TO SEE MY MOM & NIECE & EXPECTING HER SHORTLY. YYYYAAAYYY . SAVE ME 30% & THEN IN END GOT ADDITIONAL $30 OFF FOR NO APPARENT REASON LOL . UUUMMMM THANKS ♡
2015,5,"It's a fine app with good prices. It needs more permissions now so you can do more, like hire Uber and take a photo of your credit card instead of type it in. At least read what the update does before you decide there is no reason for the new permissions and it is simply an unwanted intrusion."
2015,2,I would have rated this app much better if some of the air ticket vendors such as edreams were removed. e dreams offers terrible service and has bad reviews yet Kayak continues to have it on board. Misleading! It made my experience with Kayak terrible. Remove bad service providers.
2015,2,I liked and uses this app for more than 2 years for now.. but since past few weeks it restart now and than.. its annoying when you are working on something and error msg pop.. pl fix
2015,5,Get you cheapest fares available. Includes budget airlines in the search unlike many other search engines which don't. Have been using it for over 3 years and have benefited from it. Thank you.
2015,5,The title says it all. Simple interface and always gets me the best deals around. My friends wonder how I always get the best flight and hotel deals. The answer is Kayak. Just wish they would add a filter for an all inclusive option for hotels.
2015,2,"I got the new upgrade and now all the information I had saved is gone.  And I can't use the price alert at all.  It tells me that ""there is an unexpected error at the momment"" and that has been going on for weeks now since I upgraded."
2015,5,"One of the few apps that allows you to search a wide range of dates- really useful in finding the best deals. After finding flights I like, I sometimes check the same flights on other sites but find Kayak generally offers the same or better prices."
2015,5,I was searching for flights and kayak was the most accurate app and it also got me lots of cheap options. Definitely better than all the competition including sky scanner. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
2015,5,"Haven't booked anything as of yet, soon though..very soon..like next week soon! I really hope the prices stand as they are..must wait till my VA Disability check hits the bank to be able to book these trips. It has taken four months of saving 90% of my monthly income to visit my daughter who lives on Guam now! March 2015, was my last day on active duty, after 17+ yrs of service, too many tours to remember and three back surgeries..the military medically retired me!"
2015,5,The app design is excellent. You have tons of features in a clean UI that is not overwhelming. The prices are comparable to other huge competitors like Priceline and Expedia. Highly recommended download.
2015,3,But some of the vendors not good. One confirmed a flight but then canceled it because my credit card company refused a charge from someone in the uk. I had no idea and they did not come back to me. A mess.
2015,4,I had to research the airports on Google maps . It works very good once you know the airports. But if you don't it isn't that intuitive. But the price is right.
2015,4,Kayak makes planning flights and hotels room easier for me. I don't have to be in and out on multiple pages to compare prices! With Kayak I have all in one page and available in one click!
2015,5,Loved the app. Especially it has got Multi city flight options which no other app Ive see has. Also liked the multiple airline connections.
2015,5,"Love kayak! Have been using it for years. Works great, very fast on my galaxy. no bad experiences!"
2015,5,"Explore option let's me compare airports of a region and look for the cheapest option. If I want to go to Europe, I look at the map and see which airport is the cheapest. Love it!"
2015,1,It doesn't give you enough flight choices.I search for a flight to Aruba.It had 2 choice with Delta airlines.I look at the choices.Why would I want a flight with a layover in Atlanta for 16 hours?I download hipmunk and search the same flight.It gave me several choices with different airlines.I found 1 with US Air with only 1 hour layover in CLT.
2015,5,"The +- 3 days feature for airfares. It's a really helpful tool on the website. Hopefully, they will incorporate it later."
2015,4,"Even though flexible date prices are displayed, you never know unless you check the dates it's showing.. other than that, I didn't find any issues."
2015,1,"This site only creates decoy offers from shady partners. After several attempts, none of the offers could be booked at the published price. Just a waste of time"
2015,5,There are usually other sites that provide great fares. I love this one the most. This is my first option to search.
2015,1,"Too much potential for abuse/hacks and unnecessary anyway.  If people are too lazy to enter their CC info, they're probably too lazy to pack to even travel anywhere."
2015,4,For some reason there is better deals on the web site. And the big problem for me is that you can't choose a kid as a traveller.
2015,5,"I travel at least 3 times a year, and often buy random flights a week or less in advance. I recommend this sight to everyone. I love that it compares to other sights. I won't use other sites anymore"
2015,4,"It's neato that you can take a picture of my credit card and all, but couldn't you just process payment via Google Wallet? I already used it to sign in."
2015,1,"La verdad es que el tema de búsquedas para vuelos, deja mucho que desear... No se puede hacer búsquedas x países, ni a cualquier sitio, para eso skyscanner le da mil patadas..."
2015,5,This app is the easiest and most confident way to secure a future trip or a last minute booking. I use it all the time for all my flight travel. Great app
2015,3,"The flight section does not allow to select children and infants forcing users to get quoted for 3 adults instead of 1 adult, 1 child and 1 infant."
2015,5,"Used this app now since 2012, alongside another well known one for which I had to pay an annual subscription. This one wins hands down and it's free, although I'd happily pay a subscription!"
2015,5,One of the better apps I've used for traveling. Can rely on information and schedules. I make repeated trips to SAN and will continue to use this app.
2015,5,"This site always seems to deliver the best prices on overseas flights, but so far have only checked S Africa and Australia. And quick!"
2015,5,"Easy to use, doesn't have all the airlines bit it's a good reference point even if you don't end up using them"
2015,4,"I like that it gives all flights available from cheapest to most expensive, it allows me to choose what I want, all though I have never booked through Kayak,  I book with the airline once I have picked my flight so I can't comment on that part."
2015,5,Never steers me wrong. Always alerting me of great deals!
2015,4,I've used kayak for years and love the simplicity of shopping all airlines at once.  I've booked many flights and had few issues.
2015,4,It's convenient and saves lots of time...however it doesn't allow me to search for packages such as air and hotel thus 4star
2015,5,Great app. Easy to use and always has good deals
2015,4,"The only thing is, the amount the flight prices fluctuate. Within hours a flight will go up or down by 20 dollars, sometimes more."
2015,4,Works great just wish they had option for flexible days on flights
2015,5,Saves time and money. Good interface. Love it.
2015,5,Amazing app the best experience so far with booking tickets. Thanks Kayak
2015,3,The mobile version needs to have the option for selecting children's ages.
2015,1,I ended up paying $100 more for my ticket.. didn't expect this from kayak
2015,3,"I like this app, however it doesn't give the best prices from my experiences.Always better to compare your flight with the other ones!!!"
2015,5,Love Kayak. It's the best app to find travel deals.
2015,4,I like the app and use it a lot but the latest update crashes when installing on android 2.3 device
2015,5,"This is my ""go to"" app for any type of travel. No matter how long or short stay, I can't live without it!"
2015,3,"Desktop info details such as red eye indicator, flexible dates make a world of difference when searching flights"
2015,5,Great great app. The number one travel app to use.   James banks
2015,5,The best app to find last minute flights at the cheapest cost I travel alot  most of its done last minute flying and I would never use any other apps
2015,5,"I use it all the time for cars, hotels, and flights. Never had a problem always feel like I'm getting the best price"
2015,2,When booking children are treated like adults which isn't true .. most companies offer cheaper rates for children..
2015,4,Love Kayak! It's my go to app when making any kind of traveling plans.
2015,4,Easy to use. Prices changed Alil to quick but otherwise alright app.
2015,4,Good bt now remove currency converter plz add currency exchange again nd also child passengers
2015,5,"This app gives you all the info you need to pick flights by price, timings, airline and stops. Highly recommended."
2015,5,"Kayak is one of my favourite and have fun to search about fair prices,hotels explore the world on your fingure tips and much more"
2015,5,"A great app from a great service. For domestic flights and those originating or terminating here, I've found no better."
2015,4,"Very happy with the discovery of most services,  quick to give a competitive prices and the listing is fine too"
2015,4,Just don't like it doesn't alert you of price drops unless you go on the actual app
2015,4,you can't apply them till after the search.pain!
2015,5,So much better then the iPad app.  I use both and the iPad app is terrible.
2015,2,"Every time I chose a flight it changes to a higher price, the hotels where the right price"
2015,5,I love Kayak. I only ever use it for flights and the app has all the Kayak functionalities I need.
2015,2,This is a great service before now they're offering mediocre service through their site?
2015,5,Easy to use and change settings. Use mainly for flight pricing and am very satisfied.
2015,5,And allows filters to assist with narrowing a search. Can't really ask for much else.
2015,5,Has the best deals.  Updated constantly
2015,4,"Very useful, but one must still shop around"
2015,3,Need more work done they didn't add my baby on
2015,4,Will be better to have the number of passenger segragated between adults and children.
2015,5,Use it daily... I find crazy deals...
2015,4,Price alerts don't fit screen on galaxy s3
2015,5,I really enjoy this site. I will be using it too book all my future trips❤
2015,5,"No complaints used for several asian trips,  really helps sort out options when touring new country or countries."
2015,5,This application is amazing! I really hope this is legit prises and no one it's fooling anyone!
2015,5,Kayak has saved my family and myself thousands of dollars for overseas flights during the holidays. I would recommend this to everyone.
2015,4,Used kayak last year no problems at all
2015,4,Cool app I guess as far as airline apps go
2015,5,It's so easy to use. I love it! The best!!!
2015,5,"Booked a flight for a great price, couldn't find a lower price anywhere else!!!"
2015,5,I use it a lot to randomly check prices. It's very convenient.
2015,5,"The Kayak app gives me the best selection when looking for flights, hotels and travel info!"
2015,4,Would like to be able to save searches on this app.
2015,5,I use this app for all airline travels basically. It's great.
2015,4,Please improve this app by for e.g. Not including 3 or more stop over in flight search results.
2015,5,Kayak had been very good at finding the best prices hands down.
2015,5,One site offering access to most airlines allows me to focus on more important aspects of travel.
2015,5,"Kayak  is the best way to go for traveling, thank you kayak."
2015,4,I like that you can find flights from small airports
2015,5,"Accurate, ready to use, very good rates."
2015,5,"A great app, easy to use, time saver."
2015,5,The filters make it super easy to find the flight you're looking for
2015,5,"For finding flights from various Texas cities to atl,, been a great help"
2015,5,It does the job but i still missing packaging list they used to have . Pls add again that list
2015,5,Helps me easily on my constant travelling plan!
2015,5,I found this app when i was in LA. Still im using it whenever i go abroad in korea
2015,4,Pretty cool everything in one it's worth it
2015,5,Woks great. Organizes all flights by airline and cost.
2015,5,Being able to do multi city flights is really goo

2015,5,I got better deals that i ever thought would!
2015,5,"It works as I though it would, the same from the web site."
2015,5,So easy to use and it shows all the cheapest deals
2015,5,Great aop.  You really do save.
2015,5,Kayak is a good option to search multiple carriers.
2015,5,Better than any other price finder for hotels
2015,5,Great app I will recommend to all people ....!!
2015,3,I wish it had filters such as 1 stop or nonstop and to select carriers.
2015,5,Use it all the time. My go to for flights.
2015,4,Good results. Easy to use.
2015,4,There could be a feature to setup and select from a wish list of hotels.
2015,5,Not really  buggy. Well done.
2015,5,Best prices for multiple city travel.
2015,5,What a great app. Very useful!
2015,4,I found cheaper flights on other sites that were not listed on Kayak
2015,4,Really helpful for booking tickets love.it.
2016,5,The app searches for best prices and is very comprehensive
2015,5,Good app to search for flights and cars.

2015,5,Travel with Kayak
2015,3,Kayak was known for finding flights. Now hotels is the default.  The extra step to select away from hotels to flights is annoying
2015,5,Great for searching flights. No extra images on the page. I've used it for years.
2015,5,I've been using kayak for years and the mobile app makes it easier to purchase flights on the go!
2015,5,Always very helpful to find a cheap flight
2015,5,"Fast, thorough, and easy"
2015,5,Love the app use it all the time
2015,4,As good as ever
2015,4,It is good.
2015,5,Good App
2015,5,Love it
2015,4,"I love this app! Not only can I find the flights I need, but the explore feature had been invaluable while planning my next vacation. I can see where I can go with my budget for that trip. My only request for improvement would be the ability to select specific dates (instead of month) and to select multiple temperatures. If I want to travel somewhere cool or temperate, but not to a hot place, I'd like to see those options together."
2015,2,"This update lets you take a picture of your credit card to make payments via Kayak. They don't tell you if your credit card number is safe when other apps automatically save your pictures to the cloud, though. I'm not taking any chances with that and I'm not installing an update that has permissions for features I'm not going to use."
2015,1,"I have used Kayak for years and love it but I refuse to turn control of my camera over to any app.  It is bad enough that they can track your location.  I will use the old addition of the app as long as possible. Eventually, I will probably have to delete Kayak from my phone over this issue."
2015,5,"Me likes Kayak. Use it almost daily to plan and select my flights and car rentals. The only improvement I'd like to see added would be in the drop-down list of flight viewing options: a view by ""Arrival Time"" category would make this app ultra sweet."
2016,2,The search is easy to use however kayak includes unscrupulous companies such as just fly and vayama. They are terrible companies that lie to customers and ruin travel for people. Google both companies before booking either company through kayak. Kayak should not allow either company on its search.
2015,4,I enjoy the app very much. I have booked flights and rooms several times with out any issues. I love the deals they promote and will continue using the app. Thanks Kayak!
2015,5,I always use kayak to search all my flight needs and it really meet my need and satisfaction. It's very simple to use like ABC-Z lol. Kayak is best deal on flight and gateway to the world. Thanks kayak team.
2015,5,Best prices and easy interface. I would like to see kayak adding suggestions for cheaper flights from surrounding airports and optimal days or weeks to get a cheaper flight if I am flexible with my travel. Other than that I love the app.
2015,3,"This app worked great when I first downloaded it. I created price alerts, no problem. Last several times I've tried, it just says there's an error & it couldn't be created. I've kept checking back, but still buggy."
2015,1,"Kayak is my favorite website for flights but this app is pointless. You can't even see the departure and arrival times in the results, which renders it useless.  One of the best things about the website is being able to select a range of dates, which you can't do here."
2015,5,"I plan travel for business and pleasure regularly and Kayak is always where I start! It saves a ton of time.  Love that it works well from all of my platforms: windowd, android and ipad."
2015,3,"Generally great. Never understand how the algorithms work. If I select Mia and nearby airports, it is almost twice as much if I select FLL and nearby airports. Also, why no flexible dates? Doesn't that kill the spontaneity of an app for booking flights?"
2015,1,Used this all the time but very frustrating now as does not keep search history logs and resets searches back to a default! Only noticed this since the last update.
2015,2,"Newest update removed features for flights, like layover duration, sort by arrival time, filter total duration times.  Not sure why somebody decided to remove features and call it an ""Upgrade"""
2016,2,"Ensure that when you are quoted a price on Kayak, it's the actual price you pay. Based on a Kayak quoted price I had made plans to go to Lisbon. When I clicked on the 'BOOK NOW' icon I got a price that was nigh double."
2015,5,"Had been very useful in the past, and will be in the future. UI is very easy to navigate. Keep up to good work!"
2015,2,"I use the app every day to search for numerous multi-city itineraries and relied on the search history function to make this manageable in a reasonable amount of time. This function seems to have disappeared after updating the app today,  rendering it almost useless."
2015,5,"Love it so much, very easy to navigate and find cheap tickets. Works very well and fast. 5 stars."
2015,1,This app required access to too much of my personal data that I didn't think it needed for its operation so I uninstalled it. I am going to do that with all apps that ask for an unwarranted amount of information
2015,5,"Kayak is a efficient travel body, free travel agency and travel guide. Flight ticket option is the best of the best until someone else do better one ! Higly recomended !"
2015,5,"Always my go-to app for checking airline fares and booking tickets. Wonderful, responsive UI and some pretty amazing features."
2015,5,"Handy app which provide you with comprehensive details about flights,  hotels and other services to efficiently plan your trip.. Also make your bookings.. Great work"
2015,3,Software issues that can cumbersome. Error message that no unidentified use allowed on more than one occasion. I've uninstalled and installed twice.
2015,5,Looking up various airports and dates is simple in this app.  I use it all the time to check prices for trips I plan to take in the future.  Takes a lot of the difficulty out of comparison shopping for traveling.  Would recommend to everyone.
2015,4,"I wish it was slightly easier to navigate, but a little clicking around and this app is the most helpful in quickly finding cheap flights (which is the main use I have for kayak). Definitely recommend!"
2015,5,"Works well, almost as extensive as the desktop version. Relatively quick with search results. Almost never crashes."
2015,4,"Good site, did what I expected. Nothing spectacular that I noticed, basically a search tool. No complaints."
2015,5,I always use Kayak to find the best deals. I use this app on all my devices. I love it!
2015,5,"Kayak makes my life much much easier. Although, the app crashes from time to time, this is not a big issue. My only complaint would be that its not easy to edit trip details from the app."
2016,2,"No reason for an app like this to need permission to access my camera, my photos, videos, or files, in order for it to do what I want it to. Not updating!"
2015,5,"Kayak has its quirks & there's always room for improvement, but overall it consistently provides accurate information, and I haven't found better quotes with any other app. Easy to use as well."
2015,1,"Why you want an access to (Cameras , identity, photos , file, media, location, call information , profile , etc..) is this just a booking App!? Uninstalling..."
2015,5,"Easy, fast, and free. This is my kinda app! Great multi-city tool."
2015,4,"I set an alert for price change and although I wasn't notified, the prices have increased. Besides that problem, I love the app. Very convenient"
2015,1,Latest update requires access to my camera. I want to purchase plane tickets not have them viewing my photos.
2015,4,I gave 4 stars bcz some of the info are not true. Some airlines do not hv flights but KYAKA shows the opposite. NEED YO BE FIXED !
2015,5,هذا البرنامج هو من أفضل برامج مقارنة أسعار التذاكر و الفنادق.... بصدق، لقد تغلب على مساعدات عدة من أصدقاء يعملون في وكالات للسفر و السياحة... لكن تحتاج الصبر و الرغبة لتتعلم و تعتاد على البرنامج... جوود لك!
2015,5,I like using the Kayak app because I can compare all airlines at once. It's easy to apply a few filters to zero in on the best priced flights by airports and dates.
2015,4,It's s good site to book tickets! You can find good deal!
2015,5,"I use it for every flight I book. And since my life is split between Chicago, Puerto Rico, and New York- that's a lot of flights"
2015,1,I'm wondering why you need access to all these personal things on my device. You gotta go!
2015,4,Need 1 more update on price alert notification with multi city options.
2015,5,"Ever since i was told of kayak i use it for all my travels and familys travel, always assured the best price for everything! Highly recommend it"
2015,2,Latest update removed the prices for hotels. Uninstalling Goodbye!
2015,1,"The multi-city option is only letting me input 2 cities, so it's basically useless for me today."
2015,5,Easy to use! Has it all for travel planning.  Great experience with booking through Kayak
2015,5,Never a glitch. Always get a seat. Then I upgrade to priory boarding and get to keep both bags with me on board.
2015,5,Best prices out of all the apps I could download. Compare the mobile with KAYAK online and you may see a cheaper price like I did.
2015,5,"I love going to one site, I've been using kayak since before it was kayak, it's always gotten me great prices and comparisons."
2015,1,"Takes all your info and when you tap the button to actually book nothing happens, waste of time!"
2015,5,I love this app. It's easy to use and convenient. I definitely recommend it.
2015,5,Travel planner app. Search flights hotels etc. Searches good alternatives to direct flights which means you can find lengthy stopover at no cost.
2015,4,Quick & easy way to compare prices as well as time in flight and layovers.  Don't like the new log in requirement.
2015,1,Price of rooms always higher than stated. Bait and switch!
2015,5,Easy-to-use simple app works effectively for a great guide only bad point Is that some prices / companies are non existent or incorrect
2015,4,I user the app to search for hotels which is useful but the prices usually are matched by the hotel so I'll just call the place
2018,5,MY NUMBER 1 for ANYTHING travel related. THE BEST
2016,5,I use this app to book all our travel.  Easy to use.
2015,1,Now it wants access to my camera. I'm done with this thing
2015,3,I would give five stars but I don't understand why kayak would need access to my camera
2015,3,A lot more painful to use then regular website.   Ugh
2015,1,Doesn't work at all. No network connection EVER.
2015,5,Love this app! Works fast and accurate!
2016,3,Why does the app description not include any explanation for why it needs to add access to the camera?  Well?
2015,4,Great site to find the least expensive tickets than the rest thanks Kayak!
2015,5,"I have booked every flight I've in taken in the last two years on Kayak. By far the easiest to use, and most comprehensive."
2015,2,"Way too many permissions required, am uninstalling."
2015,3,Good app and easy to use and effiecient...i highly recommend it
2015,4,I picked up some good deals but it needs more functionality
2015,1,This app does not need access to my photos or call history
2015,4,Very intuitive...do wish I had option to add a nearby airport.
2015,4,Some airlines missing (southwest would make it better!)
2015,2,Priceline express integration - nice idea but built for the masochists among us
2015,4,"Solid App, sometimes hangs but usually is pretty stable."
2015,4,I like that you can brake down the search.most of the time the cheapest flight
2015,4,Easy to use and faster than some of the other sites.
2015,4,"Very helpful for planning trips, and setting reservations."
2015,2,Nope Nada...you cannot have control over my camera...
2015,5,Never has it force closed it stopped working! Love this app and it's ease to use.
2015,4,I really enjoy checking the prices on kayak basis easier and awesome
2015,4,could you please add Omani currency (OMR)
2015,4,"This app is a big buggy & outdated, but it's a handy travel companion."
2015,4,I use this to check out future flights to plan for a overseas vacation.
2015,4,Does a great job helping find flight cars
2015,5,I've been using Kayak for several years. It does what it says on the box.
2015,1,Device ID and information is not required for this app to function.
2016,5,"It's very nice, a App that solve all need concerned about the travelling."
2015,5,Haven't used it yet but it's very reliable and I use it to check cheap prices
2015,4,It is a great app but not the cheapest travel app.
2015,5,Outil indispensable pour rechercher n'importe quel vol ou voiture de location
2015,5,It's always been great I have used it for years.
2015,5,Nice way to view most major airlines fares at one glance
2015,5,"Either for flights, hotels, or car rental, no other app comes close."
2015,5,Making travelling arrangements on the fly seems so much easier and app has yet to have issues for me
2015,5,I really like the +/-2 flight search capability
2015,5,Just wish I could select flights for certain legs like on the pc site
2015,4,Good rates. Easy to get around on.
2015,5,By far my favorite travel app. Great Job
2015,1,I could not wait  2 hours  at least to download. Never finished.

2015,5,I love it! Allways fine great prices to travel
2015,5,"Excellent application with good option , alternatives and options"
2015,1,You don't need to use the camera to book a room etc.
2015,5,First site to check for prices before booking!
2015,5,"I purchased my flight and hotel for Seoul from Kayak. Now that I'm trying to return to Seoul, Kayak is my go-to!"
2015,1,I hate being asked to rate apps.
2015,5,Great app! I use it mostly for the flights and its great!

2016,5,All
2015,5,Ok
2015,5,Booking service
2015,5,Just as it should
2015,4,"I use it for years, it's a great app,but please bring back the option of choosing the length of stopover. I don't want to list throught vast of flights with 20hrs layover in the middle of nowhere. I want to choose that I don't want to wait for a plane more than 2-3 hrs."
2015,2,With the recent update its impossible to find flights that depart and arrive the same day. Wish they would bring back the leg duration filter. Why would i want to see only flights that take 26& 1/2 hours to reach my destination?? Ugh
2015,2,"The ideas are good, and the interface is nice, but it doesn't seem to actually work. For example, when I try to check my price alerts, it says, ""an unexpected error has occurred""."
2015,5,I don't think I could travel again if I had to do all the searches individually on separate websites. I use Kayak even when I'm going to get tix directly from airline/hotel/car rental. Sometimes I can wiggle down the price directly once I know what's out there.
2015,2,You cannot select dates very well.  You cannot select dates from the end of one month and the beginning of another.  This issue make using the app impossible!!
2015,1,Click on a hotel and the price was displayed incorrectly. What's the point if its wrong and have to do the extra work anyways. Uninstalling...
2015,5,"Travel all the time and booking through Kayak app is a breeze. Smart layout, minimum dropdowns, uncluttered menus makes it perfect."
2015,3,"Application works not bad,but filter interface not so useable and sometimes doesn""t do apply"
2015,1,I use to love this app until a few days ago.  Then out of no where half of the filters dissapeared.   Now it isn't worth the time to load it.
2015,5,Helpful app. Acurrate results. Must have in each phone!!
2015,2,"No map view, no ability to filter for airport shuttles. Useless for searching for a hotel."
2015,4,"Lots of options, finds a good selection of airlines and I have yet to find a cheaper flight on any other app or site for any of my searches."
2015,1,Multi city doesn't let you choose more than one city... really?! How about some QA??
2015,2,This new version App does not allow you to view your recent searches.
2015,5,You can take first hand info from it very easily.. A good application.
2015,4,"Nice screen show, good for direct flights, missing some option for connecting flights"
2015,4,Awesome UI. All functions well covered for small screen.
2015,4,You have all you need in one place !
2015,5,Love this app it always helps me find the lowest fares.
2015,5,Helps you find the best fares....u can save up a lot.
2015,5,"Good comparison app, especially for hotels for me..."
2015,5,If you are a savvy traveler....you will enjoy this app!
2015,4,I love that they put together an itinerary for you once booking. Great app for travelers.
2015,5,"Great app, easy to navigate and easy to alter search parameters to find the best deal."
2015,5,Awesome app. Use it where ever u r..
2015,5,"It makes looking for flights enjoyable. Quick, and easy."
2015,4,Nice app to get rid of the summer blues
2015,5,I've been traveling a lot and this site has been amazing!
2015,5,Easy to use & always finds very competitive rates!
2015,3,Good app but website is still user friendlier
2015,5,It combines all the major travel info.
2015,5,Just so useful I tell you.
2015,5,Always find good deals on here!
2015,5,very accurate and up-to-date information
2015,5,Great app. Really useful.
2015,5,I could find the best fares with Kayak!
2015,5,Very useful!
2015,1,Se cuelga cada dos por tres
2015,5,Quick search cheap flights.
2015,5,Always pulls up the cheapest flights compared to all other apps
2015,5,Best! Got the lowest cost

2015,5,The Best
2015,5,great
2015,5,Its a must have app for travelers.
2015,5,I travel through Kayak ALWAYS!
2015,4,Its okay
2015,5,Ace!!
2015,5,Grt app
2015,3,So I signed up for flight notifications but it keeps emailing me dates that I did not specify in my search. I should be able to pick a specific date range in a month not only the entire month. So these updates are completely useless to me.
2015,5,"I've used this app since 2011! Loved it then, still love it now!! I use it to buy my tickets home and to look up and book hotels, cars, etc., It's always come through for me. User friendly, and always has the cheapest prices! Love it!"
2015,1,"I can no longer filter flight searches by duration, which is a disaster for the flights i frequently search. Please reinstate this function immediately."
2015,5,Been using for a couple years ACD between hotels and flights it really comes in handy
2015,5,Always the best prices and very fast and useful filters
2015,5,Does just what I expected. Quick and easy flight fares.
2015,4,Kayak is reliable and has the best prices
2015,5,Ability to find multiple city stops is a plus!
2015,5,My go-to app when I plan a trip
2015,5,Have never had any issues with this app
2015,4,User friendly.
2015,5,I love it
2015,1,"I used to love this app to search for airfare. However, the recent update removed two important features: flight durations are no longer displayed on the results page and results can no longer be filtered by flight or layover duration. Please bring these back, KAYAK!"
2015,5,"I love web Kayak for easy and quick access to the best deals.  I just booked a round trip cross country on my phone.  Simple, clear app with lots of options and tight, attractive programming.  👍"
2015,2,I too am very disappointed in the removal of two filters for searching for flights based on duration and lay-overs. This is why I used this app for flight searches. Please bring back.
2015,4,"Kayak is very easy to use, provide quick search for flight, hotel and car rental. I have been using it for a while and I like it very much."
2015,3,I used to be able to filter on the length of flights but no longer can. This is quite important when your flight involves a change.
2015,3,"This app was and is my #1 flight booking app, but why did they take down the maximum layover filter!?!??!?"
2015,5,Kayak remains the best travel searching / booking app.
2015,5,It helped me to find the right reservation and saved me many times :)
2015,5,Good app fast and accurate
2015,5,Very nice application
2015,5,Love it easy to use
2015,5,Absolutely awesome app
2015,5,Great App
2015,5,Awesome
2015,5,A must have
2015,5,Love it
2015,5,"the cheapest last minute flights, by far"
2015,5,Since day one ...
2015,3,"This app provides the most flight options when searching for flights, but, if you are looking at anything other than the cheapest fares, I can almost always find better deals from the airline website. For example, looking for premium economy seats to Asia, fare at airline site was $400 cheaper. Finding the best flight for you, still requires work...  Unless you are just looking for the cheapest possible and don't care about things like comfort, leg room, lay-overs etc. Of course, that's true at their websit"
2015,4,"Best features: 1) Search for flights using +/- up to 3 days. Saves the hassle of going back and forth, searching for better prices by changing one or more days 2) You can enter a list of different flight dates and receive daily or weekly in-app notifications of price changes. 3) Filter searches by price, # of connecting flights and flight duration. Con: You must check with your chosen airline for cost accuracy. It may vary a bit from what the app indicates."
2015,1,Great app. But i tried to book a flight to portugal 3 times... and it would give me an error after i inputed my credit card and all my information. The error message asked me to check my email... but there was nothing. So i just booked my flights directly on the air canada website! You guys need to provide more information to the user why the order did not process!
2015,1,"I have been trying to look for a good price for my travel plan. THREE TIME IN A ROW during a period of 2 months, I saw a decent flight ticket, and when I tried to purchase, it said the ticket was no longer available (even though I refreshed the app before every search!?). When I searched again right after, the price went up!! After the third time the same $#!t happened to me, I just got too frustrated, and had to write a review up here. I hope they update their system, or this app is just useless."
2015,3,"I searched plane from Malaga to Madrid. The first option was 500 NOK+-, so I chose it. But the seller gives this price only if you pay by Maestro card. Otherwise - it is 1500 NOK! I didn't have this type of card, so the offer mislead me! I want to get the _final_ price. Thanks!"
2015,4,"I found the perfect flight but this app wouldn't accept a debit Visa for payment...so I went directly to the airline's website and booked it from there for the same price. Also, I don't think the price alert works. I did a search for a flight and was given a fare if $177 and then the alert says the cheapest fare that month is $341. It doesn't make sense. It would also be nice if I could set a date range for the alerts instead of having to select an entire month, like June 28-July 3."
2015,3,"Calendar starts one month out for some dumb reason. I booked a rental car and when I got there they didn't have my reservation...oh there it was a month from now. Thanks Kayak. Another case I found a flight and when I arrived at carrier website the fare wasn't listed. They aren't an agency, so no guarantees."
2015,1,"Was looking for a first class ticket to Italy for Christmas.  Kayak found me the lowest price by $4000. All the other airline apps said it would be in the $6000 range but Kayak found some for $2000. I thought, wow! Super lucky to be using Kayak.  But then when I went to purchase the ticket it directed me the the airlines sight where it told me the price was incorrect and is actually  $6000+. It did this for both Delta and American Airlines.  So frustrating.  No other app claimed this. No way to trust app."
2015,1,"I used the app to help a friend plan a trip. It only shows ONE motel in the area -- one that costs more than double most of the (dozen or more) moderately-priced and budget motels nearby. There are no options in the app, either. This is a joke!"
2015,4,"This is a great app. Reads booking receipts better than Tripit, and has features of Tripit pro for free (eg. Notifying when departure gate changes).  Older versions of this app had a useful feature to ""view original booking email"".  This feature is not in the current version....please bring it back!!"
2015,5,"I've been using Kayak for almost 6yrs now and the app works just as great as the website. I mostly use it for flights and flight status checker. Both within the US and international. Only once in a small moon do I check elsewhere for flights. Super easy to use, truly user friendly.  Good stuff, keep up the good work and thanks for the help!"
2015,4,"Easy to use, finds decent rates (just don't ever use priceline for more than two people in a hotel room :) ) Kayak app has surpassed my expectations. Better than other travel apps I've used in the past. The hotels and flights I try to book actual get booked because this takes you to the site you need to be at. Very useful! Keeps track of all your upcoming trips too (once you email all your itineraries to your kayak app of course)."
2015,4,"It lets your explore places that you'd maybe want to travel. The prices come up on a map and it gives you the dates for that fare. It's a nice feature to have. Other than that, it's pretty run of the mill. Very user friendly."
2015,4,Really easy and convent to use. Definitely needs some work on the purchasing aspect. Doesn't take debit cards and that's all I had so I had to book through other means. I'm planning a trip with some friends for next year and all the information I'm looking for is here so i love the app just had a few frustrating moments when confirming my purchase.
2018,1,"Booked a return flight from Vegas on Kayak. They cancelled our flight 
without telling us so we either had to book two tickets home for $800 total 
or rent a car and drive the 13 hours home. STILL have not been refunded the 
$88 dollars for our flight that we couldn't take and getting ahold of them 
and figuring this out has been a nightmare"
2015,3,"I found the flight I wanted and once I selected ""book"" after entering in all of my information, I get a rejection that says ""oops, an error has occurred"". Twice. So I thought I could go directly to the airline's website and purchase the ticket only to find out the price is nearly $217 more expensive that way. And...when you want to call customer service, be aware they're not 24 hours/day. I'd love this app if I could actually pay for the flight I wanted."
2015,4,"Love this app, I use it every time I travel for up to date flight info. Even if I don't buy the ticket on kayak (like southwest) I come back and enter my trip for the quick access and notifications."
2015,5,It's got just about everything I need. I wish a few advanced features like manual ITA entries etc would also work. Would be nice chromecast my search on TV so that others can see what deals I'm looking at.
2015,4,"This app does a solid job of locating properties and comparing prices. I would like to tweak it a bit to make it easier to find the lowest price, say a month's time. also selecting the date and city you are traveling to could be a little more straightforward. Overall a solid well-built app"
2015,4,"It's mostly quite easy to use, but I would like to have the option of sorting my flight searches into nonstop only. If you can do it on this app, I just haven't found where/how."
2015,4,"I'm switching to my trip app from competitive products as it recognises more kinds of travel events, and looks much nicer. But I would except a separate my trip widget to view plans directly and access the travel plans quicker and also offline plans are key, still not in all countries mobile roaming prices are affordable."
2015,4,Good app. Save time in searching for flights  and hotels. For rental cars it doesn't have weekly rates if lease for a week or more. Priceline is a better option for weekly rates for rental car.
2015,3,"Can find really good deals on flights and hotels but I don't see an option for a child. When I add number of people,  it takes it as all adults.  Please change this."
2015,1,"Not only will it not take the card (discover), it changes the passenger info after the card fails. Changed it back twice, thought the card had a problem, then went home to pc and spirit site, all worked fine. Rating POS"
2015,5,The one thing I like about this app it allows you to search through one app!!! It gathers all the information of all the other websites you would have to try and find out which one would give you the better deal anyways. I booked my flight easy!! Booked my room easy!!! rented a car easy!! highly recommend!!!
2015,4,"Looks very convenient and provides lots of pretty reasonably cheap options. I haven't used it yet, so I'll refrain from giving it that last star until my first successful use"
2015,1,The original site is great and is my favorite. Unfortunately the mobile version doss not accept debit card. What a chame. I'll unistall and won't use it again.
2015,4,"Gate changes don't update sometime, depending on Airline and airport. Overall convenient and swift. UI is extremely straightforward, one of the must installed."
2015,1,"It crashed three times in the first 5 minutes, and doesn't have any of the features that the full website does. An app is supposed to make things easier, but this is just more difficult."
2015,3,"Works good some of the times, but I have to wait like 5 minutes to see the booking page. And usually have to reload the page cause it gets stuck on the advertisement."
2015,4,I use this app all the time. It's very handy for last minute bookings. I also like that you can set notifications for flights price changes.
2015,5,"I book all my flights through kayak. It's a one stop shop for any traveler. Love the fare alert feature, I totally scored on my tickets!"
2015,5,"My one experience with this app resulted in renting a room sight unseen. It was late at night,  i was tired and mostly lost. A night that could have been a disaster turned into a fantastic weekend! (on the cheap too!) And hats off to Aloft Hotels Jacksonville! Wonderful!"
2015,2,"What happened to the flight tracker in the My Trips section? In the past after the flight data was entered into My Trips, I was able to easily track the flight from right there and now I can't. Please change this back!!"
2015,4,"I always use this app for flights. Sometimes when i find the cheapest flight here, then check the site of the recommended airline, ill find a different availability and/or prices.  This is still very helpful since i always find great prices easily."
2015,5,This app is just amazing.  Everything you could want at your finger prints. How did I live before the price alerts.  Updates pricing to home screen.
2015,5,One of the best cheap flight apps I have ever had! I seriously wish I downloaded it a long time ago! Soo easy to navigate and u can even put trackers for future flights and it will remind you as often as u want.. love this app! Nothing negative to say
2015,2,Air tickets..when you are ready to purchase..all the add ons for luggage. .seat etc..up the price..use as a tool..but easier to go to airline site
2015,5,"I love the commercials for Kayak because they most accurately describe how difficult it is to search for the right flight or hotel. I have the app on my home screen, so it is very easy to take a quick peek at flight prices everyday. Five stars. Download now ↓"
2015,5,LOVE the real time updates about flight schedule and gate info. Catch a connecting flight has never been so much easier! Make life so much easier!
2015,3,Why cant you filter hotels by amenities? For example traveling 24 hours away and need a pet friendly hotel. I have to search all the listings to check if it is pet friendly or not.
2015,4,"Just booked flights to Florida for February 2016. Wanted to book and all the information was gone. Had to refill everything. Other than that, best prices what so ever offered to me. Give it a 4 ****"
2015,5,"I love this app but I wish we could have the option of seeing package deals for flights and hotels just like on the website. Other than that, it's perfect!"
2015,5,"This app is my best friend when looking for the cheapest flight, or a certain airline I prefer,  or certain flight times.  You get what you came for,  not a bunch of other junk. The filters are quick and easy to use. I have used this ago for several years and will continue to do so."
2015,5,"This is a great app, only negative thing I have to say is it doesn't mention what site you're booking through until your emailed confirmation. It would be more practical to know from the start. Other than that it's very convenient."
2015,1,Not always the most update info. And notifications don't work properly. They don't pop up until you open the app.
2015,2,Every time I look for a flight it only appears Virgin America airline. There is no way I can change this on the settings. So this app is practically usefull
2015,5,Kayak is the best booking service I've used. Best deals without having to look at a million websites and the app has places to keep all your information at once!
2015,3,Found a great deal on airfare but it didn't let make the purchase. Ended up paying more than the ticket sales
2015,4,"The app always works but I hate how you can't exactly modify your price alert unless you do a complete new search for your flight. Overall, I think the app works great, it's just minor issues to work with."
2015,5,Favorite website for finding fares (I've compared others) and app is even easier to use and read than website. Very fast. Only airline it doesn't search is southwest.
2015,1,Could hardly get five minutes into looking at something until it would tell me that the app stopped working.  Had to keep repeating the same process...
2015,4,Did the job. Easy to use. Only downer is I could not find a way to display filtered hotels on a map
2015,1,"For days now it has pointed me to a 7 p.m. flight on US Airways, and when I click on that and try to buy the ticket US Airways says there are no seats available.  So why is kayak offering me tickets that don't exist.?"
2015,2,What's the point if having price alerts if the notifications only work when you open the app. Even email alerts didn't seem to work.
2015,1,I liked that the app offers filter based on arrive and departure times but two  big things for me are missing. 1) does not remember my airport and  2) doesn't show multiple airline pairs
2015,5,The filtering ability alone puts this way above any other I've tried. I love that you can choose which cities you are willing to have as a layover. Allows you to coordinate with friends in other cities!
2015,5,"Kayak was a good app from the start, and is getting better and easier all the time.  Find flights, routes and fares. Had helped twice to reebok after canceled planes."
2015,1,Doesnt work with android since one year.  I contact woth devolper and no action.  Careless.  Deleting again.
2015,4,Kayak has been my app if choice to get cheaper flyghts for my vacations. It's only short of 5 stars cause I cant seem to pay LAM flights from the app directly thus I need to go to the LAMs online page thus I end up paying a higher price.
2015,4,Very easy to use and saves so much time looking for cheap flights!! Though it would be nice if the price alerts actually worked and alerted me when prices went up and not when I just logged into the app
2015,2,These thing should come with some kind of tutorial. I didn't understand how to use it at all I disapprove and will not be using this to plan my trip at the begging of the new year
2015,4,I strongly recommend to use it. User friendly and better than other applications. I found it useful and lovely.
2015,5,Saved me  a  fortune and made planning my travels so easy! A place to eat feature would be cool :)
2015,1,UI is awful. I could not figure out how to pull up a map of results. Without that results are meaningless.
2015,4,Im in the military and this app is very good and user friendly for last minute and surprise planning and always works well for me never had a problem with it
2015,4,It saves me a lot of time when searching for a booking. But if they allow to use the STOPS Option before searching for flights.
2015,2,Used Kayak to book a room.  Drove to hotel.  No rooms available.  Will use phone next time.
2015,5,I've used kayak for quite some time now and is one of the best deal getter so far. Love it
2015,3,"I had some issues with it loading the information. I had to restart the search a couple times. Other than that, decent app. Just needs some updating."
2015,5,It helped me buying tickets a lot. This app is beautiful and really useful. Thanks!
2015,5,"Love the explore feature! No problems, it's great to have everything in one place."
2015,5,Won't travel w/o this. Had small glitch (ended up being on my end) and dev doggedly pursued it and help resolve the issue. Great work!
2015,5,"Easy to use, lots of options, what's not to like?  Great app,I recommend it to everyone I know."
2015,5,I love this app. I was able to cancel a rental car reservation with ease. And searching for flights is nice to. I am planning to book a flight tonight for a future trip using this app.
2015,4,This is my default travel app. Good features. Easy to use.
2015,5,"You can easily find the cheapest flights, both mobile and website are well designed and the alert notification is a useful tool"
2015,1,Just about every price says to call. The reason I have an app is to avoid calling a million hotels. Uninstalling.
2015,1,Pretty simple operation: book a room. Just says to try a different hotel or try again later. Uninstalling.
2015,5,"Best rates, works better than Skyscanner app. Good job!"
2015,4,I had difficulty trying to add a flight. I had all information for the flight and could not find the flight. Other than that I was able to find rentals at the places I was heading to. Pretty easy.
2015,4,I really enjoyed the app. I like it.. Very easy n stress free
2015,5,Love using this app to look for flights. I always find better deals on here!
2015,5,This app does exactly what it says it does. Find flights hotels and rental cars just by tapping buttons. No problems to date!
2015,5,"I've never had a problem booking through this app, and have found it very competitively priced and usually cheaper. Cuts out a lot of hassle."
2015,4,Hotel districts/neighborhood are not listed and major layovers for flights. Otherwise useful and a good start to getting a trip off the ground.
2015,5,"very useful, though I liked best the filters for flight duration and layover times, which other users claim have been removed - that would be a shame if so"
2015,5,For the most part they have good deals. Not too good on last minute bookings
2015,3,"The full site has this feature, but not the app. Otherwise, an excellent app."
2015,5,This app is very useful for me. It provides a lot options when I am searching for flights or hotels.
2015,5,This app is able to help me find the best deal for traveling quickly and accurately. Thanks.
2015,5,I love this app. Always let me have the best travel deals!!!!
2015,4,Has the right features. Easy to search filter and buy flight tickets.
2015,4,Great deals found. Very essy and fast to use
2015,4,"Search functions for flights and hotels can't be beat, seems like there are hangups when booking more often than there should be."
2015,5,I had to make a last minute trip to Minnesota. This app has been indispensable. Great site very easy to use app.
2015,5,Searching for summer flights and search daily using kayak. Was glad to hear of it ages ago. App is great.
2015,5,Always liked kayak.  Can see everything from one site.  Nice.
2015,5,Heck of an app. Love the format. Quality artistic/color schemes
2015,4,"Searches most flights. Should be used in conjunction with airline websites that don't share data like Southwest, etc."
2015,5,"It's user friendly, accurate. Very helpful."
2015,5,Super easy to use. Many search options to save you money.
2015,5,Free and robust. Keeps track of my trips. What is not to like?
2015,4,Site provide excellent prices but fails to give historical price and also do not show trend on various sites.
2015,5,I used to use different Webpages to get my tickets but since 2 years ago I just use Kayak because it always shows me the best and cheapest tickets.
2015,4,"A useful app that has hotels, flights, etc all in one package. Nice."
2015,4,I like this app cuz it lets you know if prices are going up or down and the price you see for a ticket is what you pay.. like the price you see is the price plus tax
2015,5,Love the features and so easy. Thanks!
2015,4,I really like this application and I rate it to be one of the best bcos it makes it more easier to make enquiries about flight bookings and hotels as well.
2015,5,"User friendly, and provides the best prices.  I use it all the time."
2015,1,"Never have success, rates fed into Kayak  always way lower than when you book"
2015,5,"Always good deals on air and hotel, always works for me!"
2015,4,Probably the most well-rounded flight app out there... Very straightforward and reliable
2015,4,I use this app most of the time to check the flights rate and it's always helping me to take a decision for my next trip
2015,5,I realy loveeee this apps.. thanks ;D
2015,5,"Very useful tool to have, got a great deal"
2015,4,Handy for fast checks of price trends on most flights.  Still worth hunting for very best fares.
2015,3,An error always occured whenever I wan tot get the price alert. Please fix it immedieately
2015,5,"Or were never gone, great app, found best price versus Skyscanner and Momondo. Booked an emergency trip all through app."
2015,4,Great snap shot of all airlines prices in one screen makes it easy to compare which AL has the best flights
2015,2,Terrible app. They only let you search for their suggested trips
2015,2,Hate how it doesn't keep track of things. Sends you to other sites.
2015,5,Most complete travel search engine I've found & consistently finds lowest prices. Easy to use app & most complete data base.
2015,1,It ihas so many problems i cannot even set return date to search a flight
2015,4,What happened to the exchange rate converter? Other then that it's fast and very helpful.
2015,4,"This app provides approx details for flights, hotels .... if you are a travel freak, u should have this;)"
2015,4,Its search are less expensive than others. Really like it
2015,4,I used to swear by Travelocity. Using Kayak allows me to see all travel sights at once.
2015,4,"I am able to look at multiple things ie: flights, hotel and car rentals and it remembers my searches"
2015,4,Some improvements still needed. It gets better through time time though.
2015,5,"Very well thought out.  Couldn't have made it better myself, and I'm an expert in everthing."
2015,4,Pretty Good needs a bit of a face lift though and include 2 days before and after day of search
2015,2,I asked for fare alerts and it only notifies me when I open the app.  Defeats the purpose.
2015,4,"Love that I can search for all my travel needs easily from one engine, good deals."
2015,3,"Wanted to limit to pet friendly hotels, but no option to do so"
2015,3,Unexpected errors happen every time I try to check on my price alerts
2015,5,"This app is incredibly useful, well organised, and easy to operate. I would highly recommend it."
2015,3,Tend to hang after i search..doesnt show results.
2015,1,"All flights I search for are priced at ""CALL"" regardless of date."
2015,5,Nice add ons. Only negative is sharing flights more effective on the website.
2015,3,Its a handy app to have when traveling and want to make reservations on the go.
2015,3,I like to see comparisons and see my room options before I am asked to book.
2015,4,Easy to use when looking for big cities but not for smaller places
2015,5,I'm so impressed with this app. I dune it easy to search for exactly what you are looking for & then to book it.
2015,4,"It's really good to have this kind of app, and i think kayak is much better than the others"
2015,4,Still messing around with it but it's great so far!
2015,4,I reached enjoyed the ability to search multiple sites this one place.
2015,4,Works very well when looking for multiple flight options.
2015,4,"Enjoy the filters, makes the searches more conveniente to fit ones scheduled"
2015,4,"Recommended by everyone I know, and it's been efficient and easy to use."
2015,5,i rely on kayak for trip searching.  only issue is that a couple of times it is not updated and shown flights that doesnt exist anymore
2015,5,No other app. combines so much power with absolute simplicity
2015,5,"Love it only app that let's you do multiple airports and let's you really customize your flights to your need, and GREAT PRICES !!!"
2015,5,Great app to quickly get an idea of prices for flights and hotels. Their website is great and the app follows suit.
2015,4,Having notifications that happen only when you open the app doesn't make sense.
2015,5,Love using this app makes looking for deals so much better and faster. No more going from site to site looking for the best deals.
2015,5,Excellent application that captures prices from different airlines and consolidate into one . And also shows comparison prices with flexibility on dates. Trends of price is also excellent.
2015,5,I use this app for all of my traveling. It's awesome!
2015,4,Love this app on every android device ive ever had!
2015,4,Works as advertised and allows me to share trips easily.

2015,5,"Quickly search options,  airlines, departure and arrival times in a matter of seconds, saves me soo much time!"

2015,5,Great app! The filters make it easy to find the right flight!

2015,1,"""SEARCH FAILED"" OVER AND OVER BUT WITH FULL INTERNET !"
2015,2,Results were always worse than other apps.
2015,5,"So far, the best multi destination/city search app."
2015,5,I can plan my whole vacation just in one place and check the flight/hotel status right in app!
2015,4,Easy to use but no package deals.
2015,5,"I'm using this site from old time, it's very fast and accurate, 1 million like"

2016,1,Can only do exact dates so pretty much useless

2015,5,"Great deals on hotels, airfare &  car rentals."
2015,2,I find that it crashes constantly.  Very frustrating!

2015,3,How about telling me the name of the airline I'm flying? I can't possibly know all the airline codes! Notifications would really help too.
2015,4,Easy and simple to add your travel plans and integrated with mobile device. Free flight status. Wish I could add trips shared with me to my calendar.
2015,4,My travel plans tend to be spontaneous & last minute. The app allows me to search with flexible dates to find the best price & set up price alerts so I'm not having to do all the shop around research.
2015,5,"Does its job and doesn't crash on me. However, I do feel sometimes the prices on find on the web are different. Overall great experience."
2015,1,"Unbelievable, u have the option to add travelers but no kids ,after 10 minutes  filing up the forms kayak decided that the travelers are adults  and u have no option to change  it .waste of time  .EXPEDIA  IT'S WAY BETTER"
2015,5,I have used this application and provides great pricing. I would recommend it to all travelers looking for good deals.
2015,4,Useful for flights and hotels. My app crashes occasionally when searching for hotels using the map functon
2015,3,I use kayak for all my trip planning on my PC.  The android app lacks a lot of the features I love on the PC.
2015,5,"For the most part it works for me, meets my needs. Easy to use."
2015,4,"Been using kayak for several years, other apps come and go but Kayak is best for ""maybe i will go to..."" planning!"
2015,5,Love this app for comparison shopping! Thanks and great job!
2015,5,Kayak is great application to plan your trip itineraries ahead. I've tried lots of apps but kayak is the best
2015,1,Could not start search error and it doesn't find any flight
2015,4,Can take a little while to load but interface is great
2015,3,Shuts down every time I want to see map
2015,5,Excellent app for checking the flight tickets availability quickly and easily.
2015,5,"Love the app, easy to use, great for frequent travelers."
2015,5,"I use kayak every time I need a flight, hotel, or rental."
2015,5,Search engine is super fast and give lot of results for comparison.
2015,5,Since i downloaded the app i have bought all my travel plans here
2015,5,The best and easiest.. Thanks
2015,5,So far so good. I'm finding what I need.
2015,5,How apps  should  be built  simple  intuitive  and functional.
2015,4,Good apps. Really helpful
2015,3,simple and different from the other app
2015,4,Best way to search for vacations
2015,5,It can help me to research cheapest ticket
2015,4,Worked exactly as described.
2015,4,Easy to use.
2015,2,flight tracking loses flight info
2015,5,Trip planner is extremely good
2015,5,Best feature ever!
2015,5,"Easy, fast, and convenient"
2015,5,It's very user friendly
2015,5,This is very convenient app.
2015,5,Easy to use and reliable.
2015,5,Great app and easy to use
2015,5,I find this application very useful
2015,5,"Fast, reliable and frugal"
2015,5,Great app and has the best prices
2015,5,Love how it is providing travel related information
2015,5,The best so far
2015,5,Nearly perfect now

2015,5,Got the cheapest price for flights
2015,5,Kayak is all you need
2015,4,Ok
2015,5,Adorei
2015,3,"Some capabilities are not available on my phone (e.g. explore). I like that you can scroll through a list of your recent searches. I am using the trip planner to keep all my travel info in one place, which is great, but I wish it was more flexible and would allow me to add just a note with a date attached to it as an event, or if there was a section to catalogue info (would be great if you could add pictures to these)- I've just been hijacking other event items to fit the information I want to remember in.."
2015,3,"I think the kayak experience is great & user-friendly, but I'm REALLY disappointed that when I got connected to the airline carrier's booking portal I switched from mobile, user-friendly to a non-mobily optimized site. It was so difficult to use I had to pull out my laptop and book my flight on my computer. First world problems, I know. But there was a huge drop off in user experience. Marketing professional opinion."
2015,4,"I don't use it to book, but use it extensively to search, track, and review. The alerts for gate, time, and baggage information is very useful and has always been right.      UPDATE: My Trips stopped working. Now it just loads and never comes up. Pretty useless to me without this. Waiting for a fix."
2015,3,"After a recent update, I can no longer go directly from My Trips view to flight tracker to track a flight. This was one of the most useful features. Now I have to manually add flights within flight tracker which takes much longer. Please add this function back - why was it removed? I will give it five stars if this feature is restored."
2015,1,"Very disappointed in this app and website. I've been checking the same route and dates for the past week and everyday it gives me choices at $455, but each time I click through,  the price no longer exists. If it doesn't exist,  it shouldn't even show up in the initial search and certainly not for a week!!"
2015,1,"Did I just book a hotel or not? If the app would give me a confirmation, that would do a lot to bring it into the twentieth century. I see other people are having the same problem. I can't believe we're just throwing money down a hole."
2015,5,"Use Kayak for all my travel needs including booking (usually the cheapest deals) of hotels and flights. Keeps an awesome pocket diary of the entire trips. Don't bother with other related apps, Go KAYAK!"
2015,5,"For flights, hotels and rental cars, Kayak is a must have to see the most options easily.  It is one of my first stops when booking travel. Does not include Southwest, but it still sets the bar for me on every trip."
2015,1,"I installed this app to save me time and money, it only seems to want to show me the most expensive options regardless whether I specify search for cheaper options. The website works better!"
2015,4,"It is wonderful for a student studying abroad looking for cheap tickets. Some times I cross check ticket sales to make sure I am getting the best deals, but for the most part it provides daily updates flights I want."
2015,5,"Best flight fare search for filters and options. Can't see flex month  or +/- 3days like pc, but will do up to 2 days and can filter well."
2015,1,Current trips on Note 3 do not pull up after update. Wheel just keeps spinning and spinning. Please fix!
2015,5,There are a few airlines I won't fly. Kayaks interface makes it easy to filter them out. Adjusting acceptable takeoff and landing times is also easy. Thanks kayak.
2015,2,Can't save flights. I found cheaper tickets going directly to Southwest website. ($300 lower). Plus it took forever to load.
2015,1,"per flight times.  I want leave on ??? day, but I cannot filter the departue times.  This is possible on the web site ... only using IE which is another complaint"
2015,4,Basically this is how I use your app: I am on the highway within 1 hour of destination and I want to know # of vacancies and price rates of motels in the area.  Please consider this option thank you
2015,1,"Found a great ticket, went through all the screens on the airline's webpage,  put in all my credit card information, got to the final confirmation screen, but never got a confirmation email, or ticket. Airline has no ticket on record and prices have since gone up."
2015,5,I love this app. It's even easier than their website. They have the best deals on flights and hotels.
2015,5,"I've used this app to book flights both domestic and international, they find the cheapest prices and usually with minimal layovers. I'm flying to Thailand this summer for a very good price and I only have one 2 hour layover. Definitely check it out, even if it's just to window shop(:"
2015,5,"Love Kayak on my PC, now comes in travel sized!   Easy to navigate,  no problems.  I only use for price comparison though,  I don't actually link through to purchase."
2015,3,Have notification alerts set up for flight fare watch. Doesn't work until app is launched.
2015,5,"Easy to use,  fast app. Love all the options you have to help you find the best results."
2015,4,"Start here but check out other sites to make sure you're getting the best price. Every now and then you may find something cheaper, but for the most part,  this is the best price."
2015,5,I love being able to email my flight and hotel info to kayak and it all gets updated in my itinerary right away.    very convenient for travel! !!
2015,4,Some of the features on the website aren't transferred to the app. Like choosing up to a 3 day window for a flight.
2015,5,I love the flexible dates option and nearby airports. It helps to find the best deal!
2015,5,"I love the rates although there are certain limitations to the app, such as no way to set default locations and no way to choose '1 day before or after'."
2015,5,Enough said. Nothing comes close. Easy to use. Great design and superb utility on the go.
2015,5,"The app itself is pretty solid but I'm mega bummed they removed the ""explore"" function where you could specify date ranges and see the cost to fly anywhere in the world."
2015,5,Mainly use this for flight searchs and for keeping track of travel details.  Works great
2015,4,Es facil de usar y muestra muchos resultados para escoger. Me gustaria que tuviera mas opciones para filtrar los vuelos.
2015,5,Great app . Quick reliable results. Lowest prices. Never had an issue
2015,2,I wanted an app to show combined hotel and flight cost.  Booking separately does not do as well as Expedia.
2015,4,I have been using several apps and Kayak is the easiest and with the possibility to get the cheapest flights per date... easy to go!!
2015,1,Not able to access 'my trip'  after latest update pls help I need those for my travel!
2015,5,Very nice app. Easy to use. Very helpful to book tickets
2015,3,Bring back the Explore feature where I can put in dates and number of nights and pins come up around the world with prices.
2015,3,First time using it! So I can't put a honest review on this app or site!

2015,5,Great app. Finds the cheapest deal every time.

2015,4,Great app cheaper prices than any other hotel sites
2015,4,Don't make travel plans before using either app or its website.

2015,5,Gave me good information about where I wanted to stay and my options on rooms and rates.
2015,5,"It is very quick, thoroughly searches and finds the cheap and best option"
2015,5,"Good application but could be better,good option is to be added seats advisor"
2015,4,Comes in handy for last minute deals...

2015,5,A+
2015,5,עוזר ממש
2015,3,"Pros: importing trips from any service.  Cons: pretty basic UI. Not the prettiest application but it gets the job done. Would be better by prioritizing my trips to higher on the list or the main section.   Possible enhancements:I'm sure searching is done to some degree, but the primary reason I want to use this application is to see trips I've already bought."
2015,3,"When I'm searching for a hotel in a town that I don't know very well I would like to be able to search for a hotel in a specific area instead of just the city.  For example: Houston,  TX is a large city, so looking for a good hotel is more difficult because I'm only going to visit certain areas of that city.  I would like to be able to search by the zip code or part of town in Houston rather than going through many options just to find out it's not in the area I need to be in."
2015,2,"The website has the ability to search +/- 3 days, to search a whole week at a time. The app used to have this feature also. But for some unknown reason, that feature was taken away and now you can only search +/- 2 days. No reason to keep using the app anymore,even though it's faster than the website."
2015,3,"First time used bad that it seemed like you couldn't book everything. Also after searching multiple providers for rentals found better deal on other travel site disappointed . Maybe wasn't doing the whole trip but did not find that option at start up so booked seperatly hotel, flight' car (through different  mainstream  site."
2015,1,"Absolutely the worst! I booked a hotel for the wrong day, and I tried to call customer service but the ""office was closed"". That's ridiculous when people book and use this site all day and night. It was only 5:00 in the evening! Not only that, but I figured out later that their information for the hotel was wrong too."
2015,2,"Its pretty good for the most part. I don't get why there isn't an in app notification for check in alerts. You have email option or phone. But what if traveling and don't have data or phone? App already has the data saved, it would be local and just be an android notification."
2015,3,"Its a good app i like it. Haven't bought anything yet, but so far it does what it suppose to. However, it doesnt actually notify me about prices like it claims to.  The settings are set to send me a daily notification about airfares, yet, it doesn't unless i open the app"
2015,5,"Always helps me find the lowest price where ever I'm flying in the US. So far haven't used this app for Int'l flights. Makes me happy to use the ""Explore"" feature and dream where I could go for $200 bucks. A good app for now!"
2015,4,The app us great and includes many of the features of the website except a critical one for parents: the ability to book children's tickets. It is only possible to book adult tickets through the app. Very annoying.
2015,5,"I often start searching for flights, car rentals and hotels on Kayak. The amount and variety of results gives you a good sense of what's available. It saves a great deal of time and makes searching simple compared with traditional site-by-site searching."
2015,4,Best app for whoever want to hunt and compare flights and hotels . Too bad no option to search for vacation packages. I have to go to desktop version for vacation packages. It would be nice to see on the next updates...
2015,4,"First flight search to use to check deals. OK, but sometimes not helpful...Used it for a hotel once that did not help us make a change because I did not reserve directly."
2015,5,Love this app found an amazing deal for my flight. Another poster said you can't specifiy flight times but indeed you can. It gives the option to say no flights before 9 or whatever time
2015,4,"The app is good with searches, speed, and information. Down side is it keeps force closing on me. It picks up where it left off but it's still a hassle. Not bad enough to make me stop using it but enough where I won't give 5 stars."
2015,1,Task switch to any other app and it loses your search results.   One quickly tires of repeating the same search over and over just because you wanted to peek at Google maps for a location bearing.
2015,1,"Searching for car hire prices looks ok, until that you see the price quoted is per day!!!! regardless of the fact that one enters to and from dates. Not useful for car hire."
2015,1,"My Trips kept telling me I had to be logged in to use it, even though I was logged in. Notifications only notified me once I opened up the Kayak app. How is that helpful? I updated to the latest version. Uninstalled."
2015,3,Can't book tru multi flights!  After 4 flights it says nothing available! I can clear the previous flights and add the next set it will work but it will not allow my entire itenerary!
2015,5,"Gives you competitive prices from other companies, ie... Orbitz, Expedia. Very user friendly. Use along with Trip Advisor and you won't be sorry."
2015,5,"Love the new look for My Trips. Been using this feature for years to organize all of my travel, and I love it. Also a great jumping off point for car rentals and hotels."
2015,5,"Fantastic app for the constant traveller,  all your docs at hand throughout your trips,  used this App for years never disappointed.  However the latest update where a booking for two weeks had 14 days on show is extremely annoying!"
2015,1,Spent hours searching for flights. Twice I tried to book tickets for advertised flights on 2 different airlines.  Was redirected to airline Web pages where the flight offers were not available.  Uninstalling.
2015,5,Kayak works great on my SG3. Quick loading and easily transfers you over to other websites when you find a good deal. It's been wonderful in planning our big trip to Orlando this fall.
2015,5,All the great Features of more  expensive apps. Nice user interface.  This app also excepts all confirmations and adds them to your trip.  Very reliable.
2015,5,I use it all the time. Faster and easier than other travel site apps. Also proves the point that prices on airline tickets are rarely lower at a travel site since they get commission. Hotels are a different animal. Plus I prefer to buy my ticket directly with the airline wherever possible.
2015,4,From a technical standpoint this app is flawless. It is extremely stable and responsive and the UI is excellently designed. I just wish the functionality to book a room was better integrated.
2015,4,I use this site a lot for flights the UK and Thailand. I've only once found a slightly cheaper flight and that was booking direct through Qatar. I sometimes use a domestic route in Thailand run by Thai Airways and that is a lot cheaper booking direct them through Kayak.
2015,5,"Saves making multiple searches, try this then that airline. Gives cheapest hotel deals...at least for the few I tried. Indispensable."
2015,4,"Thus is probably the most thorough flight search engine that I know, they have been consistent for a long time. They could a little better about explaining the Buy Now portion, because it seems very unpredictable."
2015,5,"Love kayak, as always it's a really easy to use interface. No isgsues at all... Galaxy Note 4"
2015,4,5 star if rate notification/monitoring would work for one way flights. It only monitors round trip fares.
2015,5,Good feature set. Email import was able to handle bookings in french from gîtes de France. Other apps failed at it.
2015,5,"Searched all websites and other travel apps, KAYAK app helped find the best flight tickets for me and my family to the Philippines. Highly recommended! A++++"
2015,5,"The only use issue I have are occasional crashes. Otherwise, a superb app! This is simply the best travel related aggregate and comparison site I've ever used."
2015,4,This is a great app to have an overall view of your journeys. It is not allowed to create multi itinerary trip!  That's why 4 stars
2015,5,Looking for flights for a round trip to mexico and Chile. Seems to be finding some cheap flights. Lists the times and prices clearly. Recommend from my previous experiences of using the website on PC
2015,5,"I use it both to find flights/hotels/cars and to compare fares and rates.  It's not quite comprehensive, but it's close.  One improvement I'd suggest:  if it could adjust for available discounts (AAA, ABA, etc.) in hotel/car rental rates."
2015,5,"So far so good, showing some pretty decent deals from across the board! Great app thanks.."
2015,5,"Awesome App, finds exactly what I need! I highly recommend it for those who love to travel on a great deal."
2015,5,Over many years I have found this to be the best app for finding and booking flight deals. Highly recommend it!!
2015,5,Great way to see multiple airlines and their prices. The app has a nice layout that is not confusing at all.
2015,5,"Love the price alert feature and mytrip  feature,  everything in one place.  No more looking for stuff in my email."
2015,5,I use it a lot to get started and see all the airline options for trips.  I have also found great car rental deals.
2015,5,The Kayak app is so easy to use. It's the first place I go when I begin to plan and budget for a trip.  Love the ability to receive fare alerts.
2015,4,This service is great. Not as comprehensive as I would like but it's a very quick and easy way to plan a trip and get a good price too
2015,4,"I have booked through the app twice--easy, simple, done.  I have checked rates quite a bit, with the app being quick and responsive to my changes."
2015,1,"Prices always shown cheaper on app. Redirects to airline to purchase flights, which are always listed much higher. Uninstalling."
2015,5,"I used to just travel by canoe everywhere, then I realized that kayaks go faster than canoes so I started using kayak. it's made all the difference in the world!"
2015,1,Crashes on startup. Sent report multiple times no update. Please fix it!
2015,5,"This app  is very quick . adds ? No a problem. To make it perfect, please, work to see if the alert could notify right when the price changes."
2015,5,I love to travel and I always use this site and now I have it on my phone so convenient.. I love this app
2015,3,This was a really useful feature which seems to have disappeared. Please bring it back!
2015,5,Not having the bugs previous reviewers were complaining of. Works great!!
2015,5,"Whether it was the new phone or an upgrade to the app itself, everything seems to be working well again. Great app"
2015,4,"Easy to use,just doesn't search certain airlines like Southwest when you do flight searches,other than that it's great"
2015,5,"I'd even argue the app is simpler to use than the site, but maybe that's just because I love using my phone for everything."
2015,5,"The one stop shop for airline tickets.  This app is light, fast and never crashed on me."
2015,1,Keep on getting an error message that there is a problem connecting to the Internet. I am connected & all my other apps are working.
2015,4,"Getting better all the time: needs to handle travellers other than owner, also provide solid offline functions."
2015,3,Had to go to a travel agency because Kayak only does American credit/debit cards. Pain in the neck!
2015,4,"Pretty easy to use.. I wish it was easier to delete search history.. Overall, I am glad I have the app.."
2015,4,No hassle for monitoring the cheapest plane tix. Thank you KAYAK.
2015,5,"Love Kayak! Reliable, and always finds the best deals!"
2015,3,Not nearly as good as the desktop site. It has only a few filters and I often have to use another search to find what I need
2015,5,A must-have for all travelers. Really easy to use. And the My Trips functionality is a life saver.
2015,3,"Very easy, 3 star only because I've never done this before maybe 5 star once I've done more of these types of search"
2015,5,"My favorites are the explore, airline, and car rentals.  Explore  is awesome.  I show it to my friends."
2015,1,Trying to get flight from Cincinnati ohio to Denver Colorado. And no flights show up-_-.
2015,4,Only use it to search for deals. Pretty simple.
2015,5,The best travel site. Offers most cheap hotels n airfares. Easy to compare other prices.
2015,2,Application very slow and couldn't load the booking page.mobile cpu gets too high.Improvements needed in app.
2015,3,I like that it's easy to use and fast. Really good app to search flights and quick prices.
2015,4,"It's not quite as good as using he website, but it's not too shabby. Gets the job done."
2015,5,Love the app.  It is fast and accurate.  Price alerts are really nice.
2015,5,I have this app in all of my devices.. its easy to use.. love it
2015,5,"An app I've found really useful on my travel planning, has never failed to me or showed deceiving prices, totally recommend it!"
2015,5,Works great! No real complaints.
2015,4,"I like this app. But it can be buggy at times, but good overall."
2015,4,i'm always searching for my flights & hotels here. good app but sometimes they miss good flights& hotels
2015,4,One of the best apps. I have used to look up & book flights.
2015,4,I like it more as a select for flights but I'd rather book on full site since this tends to freeze on me
2015,5,All possible flights from the lowest rates on economy flights to business class are here in Kayak. One website/application is all you need.
2015,2,Needed to know how many beds in room and how many children are allowed. This info not available
2015,4,Still has some improvement that needs fixing but over all great app!
2015,1,I checked other sites and this site was the highest over charging by $30
2015,3,"fast search of hotel and flight, however missing exchange feature.."
2015,5,"I've used this app many times to compare prices for flights, hotels and car rentals. Have found it to be very useful"
2015,5,"Always loved kayak. Have recommended it to family, friends and colleagues.The app is just another extension."
2015,5,Works well on all !my android devices!
2015,4,"Love this app. Very handy , all in one"
2015,4,would be great if there is a direct upload of itineraries to app.
2015,4,Can be quite distracting with its where's cheap at x time of year feature!
2015,4,It's a cool app but my price alerts keep disappearing from my phone
2015,5,"Got to have it. Easy, Cheap, Dream come true, and go and have fun."
2015,4,"Nice app, if it gets material design then it will be THE BEST"
2015,4,Easy to use and understand .No long loading periods to find prices
2015,3,It would be nice of they had all the airlines available
2015,5,I have been using Kayak app. for years now and it completely  meets my needs.
2015,5,Perfect app for my needs.. Best thing is it's free..
2015,5,Still in disbelief how cheap and convenient kayak has been. Hawaii here I come!
2015,4,One of the top 3 or 4 places where one should shop for travel.
2015,4,Could be better. Some functionality seems to be lacking.
2015,5,Most of these apps/sites are the same but Kayak makes it an easy to use and one stop shopping.
2015,5,Best application for flight booking. Gives cheapest prices from loads of websites.
2015,3,"The calendar for booking flights is showing May twice, skips June, and shows July twice."
2015,1,Crashes everytime I tried to use it since the last update.
2015,5,Has really helped me find great deals on flights and compare prices and find the cheapest days to fly out of the week.
2015,5,Cheapest flights for domestic and international travel.  Always finds the best flights regardless of time of day I love it.
2015,5,"I used it a lot when I was traveling in south america - easy to use, good prices and very comfortable !"
2015,5,"I love the app would like to see a package options for flight, hotel & car."
2015,5,"It is quite convenient to search flights, hotels and rental cars."
2015,3,Is giving errors going to reinstall see if that helps
2015,5,I love this app. It so convenient to compare all airfare prices.
2015,5,"Working fast, looking good, I like the function to plan two more stops flight"
2015,5,"Good deal, way better than direct with the airline."
2015,5,I don't want to lose my fingers searching other travel sites!
2015,5,This app has made traveling easy and affordable it's irreplaceable to me.
2015,5,"Not quite as sophisticated as the full website, but still, very good for an app."
2015,5,Only thing that could make it better is if the app would save previous searches and more pictures of accommodations
2015,1,Just tried to search for flights to Cuba and no results were given... Is this for real or some bug?
2015,5,Great alert function and can manage all travel in one app
2015,5,It finds the best prices for your flights .... I'm very pleased

2015,5,Love having everything in one place. Perfect for travel

2015,5,Kayak helps a lot in organizing my travels.
2015,5,"Great for flights,  rent a car., hotel"

2015,1,... all the time on Sony z2
2015,5,Good app. My go to for hotel reservations.
2015,5,"Great app, easy to use, fantastic results"

2015,1,"Crashes on load, or when I hit menu about 25% of the time. The widget has shown my trip info once, out of 5 days of travel. I used this app a long time ago and liked it, so this trip I decided to use it again. Thankfully I was able to use much better software provided by west jet and delta, to track flights hotel etc. I will try again in another year or two and hope they improve to what they used to be."
2015,2,"I use kayak whenever I am looking for flights, however when booking flights I've never had a good time. I am either redirected to the airlines website, which is fair and not related to Kayak's app or I use their services. I was not informed of the hidden charges of booking through kayak, which its UI did not share telling me only the inflated price of the ticket as if it were a part of the airline fees, which really put a damper on an overall great experience in searching for flights when I'm computer-less."
2015,4,"Useful, but doesn't replace a travel agent unless all you need are simple itineraries like direct out & back flights. If you need multiple destinations,  layovers,  etc. this won't be sufficient. Flight info is better than the rental car deals."
2015,5,"Very easy to use. Have used all over the world; flights, accommodation etc. Keeps itinerary with up to date information and easy to share with other kayak users (if want family to follow your whereabouts). Recommend to anyone to use."
2015,5,"Wasted my time with so many others apps until I came across Kayak. Trust me, Kayak beats the prices of all other search engines. Also its layout, details and speed are excellent. Well done guys!"
2015,4,This is a good app to keep you with the changing flight prices. It seems though that the alerts don't always work and you can't filter certain airlines on the price alert. Overall this is a good tool to have if you travel often.
2015,2,Kayak offers some of the best deals around but the app is not very good. It's inflexible and too stripped down. It's much better to use the full website.
2015,5,"I love this app and have used it for almost all my vacations, but was the buzz feature eliminated during an update? I really appreciated that feature as it helped me plan flights around lower airfare trends.. Please bring it back. Love kayak. Miss buzz."
2015,4,"Was user friendly, fast. Will upgrade to 5 star if it's consistent. I will be happy if you can account for children while using flight tickets booking. There is a difference in price of the tickets"
2017,1,Booked with webjet and got email reminders from kayak with no mention of webjet and no mention of my confirmation code.  Confirmation code is also not the coffee the airline uses to check you in.  Deeply confusing.  Amateurs and support was unprofessional insisting they're stupid system made sense.
2015,1,"I think this app is a scam. Its full of ads for other booking sites and the base prices for the hotels change. Quality Inn listed at $79 on one page, then listed as $93 on an ad the next page! I can't trust it."
2015,1,"Inaccurate, wrong info. Made reservations with it just to find out later that the there was no space available but the app kept saying there was, rented a vehicle and got the wrong trim, held the reservation for only 1 hour instead of 1 day,  you're better off using the official websites of most places for rentals & reservations"
2015,5,Worked great for planning a vacation with people coming from different spots to track best fare. Only thing missing is southwest airlines. They have good deals so it's another website to check.
2015,5,I've booked 12 flights in the last year with Kayak. I have never had a problem with it. It is super easy to use and gives me the best flight options for my budget. I will never use anything else.
2015,5,I got sweet deals by using this app. It will give you a final price (taxes + fees included). Even has email alerts!
2015,5,Super easy to use straight forward. Great user interface. Much better than most of the other hotel pricing apps I've used.
2015,4,I don't have to search  for my trips in other apps kayak gaves me everything I need. One little thing... Need to add children when you are searching for trips
2015,4,"App works great, really like the map feature for flights. I wish you could use the flexible dates feature for multi city flight searches.."
2015,5,Glad I finally got the app instead of always using it in my browser. Lots of price watching features and I love the flexible date and airport feature. Kayak is always the best.
2015,4,Amazing app. Too bad android version's UI is fugly. Would give 5/5 but UI sucks
2015,4,"You don't get fare alerts that you sign up for unless app is open. Better to sign up on the website. Really Great, easy to use otherwise"
2015,5,"I'm in the military and Kayak is always my first choice to find hotels and flight. Whether its for going home or my vacation. I've tried using Expedia or similar sights and I have been screwed over. The only other one I trust is Price line. Kayak will even show similar searches through other web sights to help you find the cheapest flight, hotel, or rental car."
2015,3,Prices are not accurate or current. There is no option to add a child traveler. The app only lets me add adult travelers.
2015,5,"This is the easiest-to-use mobile travel planner I've found, and my simplest way to get good prices when I need to arrange things quickly. I use it both for business and vacation travel all the time. I like it better than Travelocity, expedia, orbitz, and the airline websites, both for good prices and the convenience of getting everything done quickly in one place."
2015,5,Very helpful and always up to date. Tried to find cheaper deals independently but failed. Kayak always has the cheapest deals.
2015,3,Every time I open the app it says I'm logged in but I have to log out and then log back in to see my price alerts.   Edit: this problems only happens when I use Google plus to log in. There's no problem with the regular log in.
2015,4,I use this app whenever I fly. Great deals. Easily organized. Interface could use a facelift but otherwise outstanding.
2015,5,So far this app finds good deals on flights... haven't made it to the processing deptpartment... will rerate as soon as I do
2015,4,"I always use kayak for personal and family travel.  I love the comrehensive options across so many carriers, agencies, hotels, etc."
2015,4,Its a good app that keeps Everything together. I would love if it also had a countdown showing you when your trip starts. I also don't have the function with the Packing list??
2015,5,I love this app. It is easy to compare flights and track price changes. The app has all of the features of the main site and is easy to use.
2015,5,Kayak has found me deals that no other online travel agents are able to find. My most trusted website for hotel and flight shopping.
2015,5,When I Wanna get away to Vegas for a night or two to get some hot Nappy Dugouts this is what I use to seal the deal. I just booked for next weekend!
2015,5,Love the updates about flight etc for every trip. Thanks Kayak. You make my travels simple.
2015,2,The Kayak prices far over the origin airline prices. Prefer airports can't be stared. On the webpage it searching for over an hour for a flight. Almost useless this app.
2015,4,Only real complaint is how it double posts events in the Google calendar. Fix that and you'll get the fifth star.
2015,1,"They continue to run commercial of lazy old guy still living at home, stealing his elderly mothers chairlift and laughing about it. I for one boycott Kayak"
2015,3,"Overall good for flights (only use it for that), but results are not always consistent when you are using the +-2days option: maybe you change 1 date and the prices for this date change and where not shown in the previous search."
2015,2,Pet friendly is there an option to find out if hotels are pet friendly or to choose to sort by amenities? If not this app is worthless to me.
2015,3,"Honestly,  I love the ease of the app, except that it doesn't notify me of the low rates until I launch it again. So what's the point?"
2015,2,There's no possibility to add children in the searches.  For us is very important as we have two children and sometimes they make the difference in the final price
2015,4,Always a reliable app but the price alert feature doesn't update which kind of defeats the purpose.
2015,5,"Great flight search tool. Love the calendar view with pricing and regions, per time of year etc"
2015,5,I am extremely satisfied with the Kayak app. They usually update me to changes in my itinerary before the airline.
2015,3,The prices do not stipulate the currency the quote is in. I have heard stories of people who thought they were paying in CAD because the hotel is in Canada but they found out after the fact that it was USD.  That can be a real hit that hurts.
2015,2,Just trying to put in flight dates alone was hard enough.. I have a modern tablet but I'll have to use the pc if I want to use kayak..
2015,4,"It's a great app, but I wish I could see prices reflecting myself and a toddler. As it is, you have to either search for flights without the toddler or as an adult."
2015,4,Really needs some filtering improvements such as saving filters  for saved flight alerts. Otherwise you need to keep reapplying multiple filters each time you want to find appropriate flight that match your needs
2015,5,Quick and easy and good deals. I've used this app several times and have never been disappointed.
2015,2,"The my trips function never remembers your login details, requiring you to have to log out and back in each time the app is opened!"
2015,4,It is a great app but sometimes I use the Web version Because it has more options & features.
2015,3,The Book now feature is broken. I get an infinite spinner. Glaxys3
2015,5,"Love the simple interface. Also, excellent filtering capability & extremely accurate results!"
2015,4,"Does what it does well, and loads of features. Definitely a must for frequent travelers and road warriors."
2015,1,Booked with Kayak. Therefore cannot trust either company. Lots of wasted time and higher prices paid.
2015,5,I always use Kayak to find out my flights and always found best deals. Excellent application
2015,5,Great app! I've used it mostly for car rentals and hotel bookings. I always find great rates and availability. Easy to use and manage.
2015,5,First time using this app and was very impressed! Gave lots of options and was very easy to use!
2015,4,But otherwise okay. Prefer the full web version on my laptop.
2015,4,"Great app saving big bucks meeting lots of hot chicks on vacation, they all love me and my cash and My tongue and Bo bo"
2015,5,Cheapest flight I could find through kayak. Easy to use. Can't wait to leave for my trip!
2015,5,Yes! I enjoy using this apps for good and cheap flight. And easily compare the price. Great!!
2015,5,"I have used this for every hotel, flight and car rental and never had a problem. Reservations are always correct and ratings provided have always been accurate and helpful."
2015,5,Very intuitive. Easy access to flight details. Love browsing and looking at price of airplane tickets.
2015,2,Matched with Expedia did 8 different flights to places in asia.  In every case kayak was 250 dollars + more expensive .
2015,4,It's great for me works without glitches for my phone.
2015,5,I love this app. That's the first place I go when I look for tickets. Its very easy to use.
2015,5,Wonderful tracking for my trip. I loved the itinerary tracker. It gave me all my info in one place.
2015,5,This app is very useful.. easy to use... happy with results every time.
2015,5,Get a lot accomplished in one place. Good deals always!
2015,5,Great for quick travel searches on the go. Love the hotel tonight feature.
2015,5,"Best search tool.  Fast, complete, accurate, convenient."
2015,1,I started booking a room but canceled some how kyak finished it and chargers me for a 500 dollar hotel.....which I was never at
2015,5,Very useful apps for travelers. I like it's feature to use.
2015,5,This app save us 350.00 during a tough time my husband had open heart then 2 months later had to have more heart surgery..hospital flew us to Dallas but had to get home...They saved us!!
2015,5,"It does exactly what it's supposed to do, find deals. 😀"
2015,5,Been the best place for me to find flights. Made user friendly.
2015,5,It's Great to check out Prices on the phone. Convenient
2015,5,I love it i find this app more usefull than the other known apps like this but im loving it great discounts EVER by far ive seen
2015,1,Found cheaper flights on my own.  They didn't give Southwest or Sprit.
2015,5,Very useful app... I love the notification system
2015,4,S easy to use without too many ads. Feel confident with my selection.
2015,5,I love the explore feature to find the best deal in planning my trips.
2015,2,I put in my dates and times for a flight and I wait and I wait!  The airplane spin around and around can there possibly be that many flights?
2015,4,4 stars only because of my ineptitude. I'm not tech savvy and seem to be limited in my search abilities.
2015,4,I love the explore app that kayak has! I would give it 5 stars if it could incorporate hotels too with the explore app.
2015,3,ios version puts the price on the maps. Why not here?
2015,4,"Great options and results, but watch selected days as it doesn't always show just what was requested."
2015,4,But it keeps on freezing and shutting down on me while I am seeking for prices. Not cool
2015,4,Quick and accurate. As long as you have a good service provider
2015,2,"Simple flight search makes the app just spin, spin, spin...  Google flights was faster..."
2015,2,Won't connect to 4g or WiFi even though my phone is connected.
2015,5,"Love this app! Really is the only thing you need, does it all!"
2015,5,"It's an awesome way!!  to compare and save!! And to get the best rates, set the price alerts!!!!"
2015,1,Might work great if it wasn't for the giant price line ad in the middle of the screen
2015,5,"Quite good buy,nice room,clean pool area good breakfast, close to beach and downtown. Enjoyed for many years."
2015,5,"I love that they save your recent airport searches, and use autifill when applicable. Makes searching a breeze!"
2015,5,very affordable flights!! Great for me cuz my gf lives in Florida so I'm traveling alot!!
2015,4,Only one small issue had problems with choosing types of travelers children adults etc.
2015,1,Most hotels say to call the hotel for rates...waist of time
2015,5,"Very simple and useful, pro and con reviews are super helpful. Gonna stay at an unrated one and leave a review!"
2015,4,It is a very helpful app. Have to improve some issues.
2015,5,Works well. Can't compllain
2015,5,Can't wait to go on adventure. This app makes booking so easy.
2015,4,This is an easy to use intuitive app. Frankly better than the website.
2015,4,Does a really good job of giving me the best rates out there
2015,5,This is one of the best site we found for airfare.  It is simple  and very easy to use.
2015,5,I tried many other apps to help plan my first vacation. This was by far the best!
2015,5,I've used this app to travel to Puerto Rico roundtrip for less than $400 and some other amazing deals.
2015,4,"Good app, shows other discount site prices as well."
2015,5,Everytime I check multiple sites for flights and hotels Kayak is by far the least expensive. A must have app!!
2015,5,"Smooth, quick, and reliable...  I like how it seems my settings for checking the rate daily"
2015,5,I use this to keep track of all of my trips. It is so simple and effective!
2015,4,With apps like Kayak I don't think there is any need of travel agents.
2015,5,Overall awesome...some quirks with the alerts not showing the days but other than that I use this to plan my flights
2015,5,"No glitches, nor crashes since upgrade to KitKat and latest release to this app... Keep it up!..."
2016,5,Look at this easy space to find tickets and cars! Nice.
2015,4,Like the price offers from hotels but air tickets are more costly then skyscaner app
2015,3,Its nice app which provides all at one plateform.
2015,5,This is my favorite app for all my travel needs. I adore the alerts!
2015,5,Best app I've used for travel pricing. Very useful!
2015,4,I compared it with other apps..its better..n gives lowest tariffs..recommended
2015,5,Pretty fly app yo! It make flyin' totes legit.
2015,5,"Qiuck, easy , convenience, use it all the time. Never a problem."

2015,5,And it offers cheap prices. Very organized look and easy to use
2015,4,Enjoy the ease of the app esp as someone who travels often.
2015,4,I swear by Kayak. . Only search engine I mess with. .
2015,5,So easy to navigate and the cheapest tickets I've ever find on any site.
2015,4,Good but not always the lowest rate.
2015,4,Useful app to get many thing at one place
2015,5,"Best app for flights booking, you can find the best prices for one destination from all airlines."
2015,4,I use this app all the time.  Its great.
2015,4,Sometimes it does not give options of flights I get
2015,2,Good price just can't buy fast
2015,5,Just saved 14$ just by getting the app...will def use this for all hotel bookings
2015,4,Good for last minute booking. Great prices
2015,5,I always buy my tickets over here and is so great to have it in my phone.
2015,5,This app searches it all with great flex options that searches multiple dates and airports all at once to find the best price!
2015,5,I use this app constantly and book flights for better prices than I have gotten anywhere else
2015,5,Easy to use and incredibly handy. Love kayak!
2015,5,"Nearly perfect,  I just can't think what could be improved."

2015,4,It found several options for me for flights and hotels.
2015,5,Always a good and fast way to check to make sure you are getting the best deal.

2015,4,
2015,1,"Have tried installing this app on my Android tablet, repeatedly.  Will not connect or run.  Other travel/booking apps work great.  Too bad!"
2015,2,"In an attempt to keep all info for an upcoming trip in one place, I put flight & hotel info in Kayak. However, when I try to pull up my trip info, all I get is a spinning green circle. It never loads. Then, when I try to search for an airline, nothing comes up (tried to search for Alaska, a very common airline)."
2015,5,"I love this app! Very simple and easy to use! It gives options on hotels, car rentals, flights, etc. It takes from all websites and condences the info into this app so no need to search 50 differ tabs. Great app!"
2015,5,I usually find apps for searching/booking stuff to be a pain (versus website versus) but not the case with Kayak.  I like the filtering/narrowing features and get almost as much done in the app as the website.  Well done.
2015,5,Buying a plane ticket for the first time was a bit overwhelming at first. But searching with Kayak was so easy. They showed many more options and lower prices than hipmunk!
2015,5,The application has improved a lot in recent updates. One of the best application for flights search across the globe. Some additional features may be added for local search and flight tracker for improvement.
2015,5,"I'll never never let go!! It makes my travel arrangements so much stress less, now I can focus on enjoying myself. Thanks 🌹"
2015,2,"A couple of versions ago the kayak app kept a history of your searches and then this feature was suddenly gone after this app was ""improved"". Was this a privacy concern?"
2015,3,"It's OK, but it doesn't work the way you would expect for searching for flights from my airport. Could auto populate better."
2015,4,Works fine. Makes travelling easier. Saves me time and money.
2015,4,I live love this app. Seriously. Wish I could see the confidence of whether price will go down on mobile though... :)
2015,5,I use this and TripAdvisor. They both have their pros and cons. Kayak is better for flights and cars. I like the way it is set up. I use it for all my travel needs.
2015,5,It's everything you need in one location to find book and to your perfect destination it's simple and easy to use. You can even set up alert to tell you when the price of a flight drops I find that pretty handy when looking for cheap flights
2015,4,Got great flight info and pricing with a few taps on my phone. Too easy!
2015,1,No longer a full travel app now that the packing list feature is removed. Extremely disappointed.
2015,1,This was my favorite app because I travel a lot but it doesn't work anymore. It just loads and loads for ever it is so annoying and inconvenient.

2015,5,I really like this app. Works really quickly. ..
2015,5,this app is so awesome!! I downloaded it and planning spontaneous trips has never been more for or easier!!! Great app
2015,1,The map for finding location of hotel is STATIC - I can not move in it to see the general location of the hotel I need - fix it for more stars.....
2015,5,Simple and easy to use.  Better options than Orbitz!!
2015,2,Prices were same as just calling motel....I was actually able to negotiate my stay cheaper with manager on phone where I booked
2015,1,couldn't lookup car rentals near the airport that im arriving at. Waste of Time!!!
2015,5,Booked some international flights through Kayak. Best prices. However hotels not so much
2015,5,"Tried a lot of flight apps, although not always displaying the cheapest prices they are the most accurate - no fake cheapies only to get to booking page and be disappointed by ""sudden"" increases or wrong dates - good work kayak"
2015,5,"Very nice interface, love using it in tracking good deals"
2015,1,I was waiting for 20 mins and still couldn't do it after trying to book a room.. Uninstalling this app and using expedia..
2015,1,Just downloaded not giving me any information after selecting date and departure city really slow
2015,4,Awesome app to search for airfare.  Needs to add an airline alliance filter.
2015,4,Simple and easy to use. That's all I want when it comes to booking flights...simple and easy.
2015,4,Its easy to use.. very quick... its worth the 4*

2015,5,"I travel 20 to 25 weeks a year. Use Kayak frequently to compare flight, car, and hotel rates."
2015,5,They have the best airline prices by far!  Very happy with the site and often recommend to others!
2015,5,Found a rental car for $7 including tax. No one can beat this.
2015,4,"Liking this, ""I need a hotel room tonight"" Button"
2015,5,Great deals!  Easy to use!

2015,5,"Kayak  is very good at knowing your flight status, reservation, airport traffic monitoring and other things"

2015,4,Seems to be a solid application and finds competitive priced airfare.

2015,5,Don't use any other app for low cost on travel rates
2015,5,"Love that it will text me about gate changes, delays, etc."
2015,4,Very good application. I use it for booking.
2015,4,Makes life easy with great search options
2015,5,"Use it all the time, particularly like the gate change notices that you get when in the airport."

2015,4,My opinion
2015,4,Ok
2015,4,Ok
2015,5,מעולה!
2015,5,Fantástico
2015,5,Amen to this app
2015,1,"Despite multiple app updates recently, this app constantly reports on startup that it doesn't have an internet connection, and then it won't work. This happens on 2 different devices and at times when every other app used has no trouble accessing the net.  I  couldn't even report the problem via the app because it said there was no net connection!"
2015,4,"Kayak does exactly what I would like it to do! Which is find flights/hotels and other travel logistics. It finds flights at the same cost or lower than other travel sites/apps. One improvement might be that the ""find near airports"" could have better customization on the mobile version (on the website it allows for a radius to find other airports in)."
2015,4,"Kayak is a great app once its open, but missing a nice widget. Kayak does have a widget but it is very very basic, and not very pretty.  I travel often and have to  resort to Worldmate simply because of its widget.  Would much prefer Kayak, but the convenience of seeing upcoming trips right from an android homescreen is too useful to pass up."
2015,2,"The website is much better. Facebook login isn't working in this current version. Flight search gives an error ""anonymous access to kayak api denied"". Doesn't have month search or lists of deals and packages"
2015,4,"Have used Kayak for years and the app has worked well on all the smart phones I've had (Exhibit2, S4, S5). Only wish I could sort results in more ways, and have the same search options that the website has, but still a very good app, just not great."
2015,3,"Bumping this down to 3 stars. Android is crashing (samsung S5 with latest upgrade).  Also not getting flight tracker!  Love the website, ios, android.. Truly perfection"
2015,3,"I can look up flights OK, but will not connect to airline to book the flight. It would also be great if you could save your trip, and go directly from your saved trip to book the flight. After trying to book my flight for two hours, the app stopped working."
2015,5,"One of the best price comparison tools out there. Mostly the same as with their website but did find inconsistent fares a couple of times, where the website was cheaper. Still, a great app to check airfares, car rentals, and travel on the go."
2015,4,Awesome flight finder with many good filtering features. Only four stars because some flight info has been inaccurate during my current trip around Europe. LG Optimus G.
2015,5,"Kayak shows flights that are consistently among the cheapest compared to other websites. I love their explore option to see where I can travel the cheapest, it sets up fun vacations. The app works perfectly, no bugs that I've noticed."
2015,1,"I'm disappointed when the app removes a great feature upon an update. Bring back the ""trends"" feature. Or if you are removing it, mention that in the update manifest, so that I don't take the update."
2015,3,Could have been more useful.Not all the flights are available though. NRT- SIN route though Vietnam Airlines keeps popping up but when I click the flight it takes me to Vietnam Airlines but the flight is nonexistent. Too much trouble!
2015,3,"The website let's you log in with Google, but the app on an android phone does not. Since the account has no password there no way to log in from the app. If you create another account, it works OK."
2015,5,Compared to other apps/sites Kayak app was best for my needs. Simple minimalist but powerful UI and great service. Keep up the good work.
2015,1,"Keeps stopping when you tap on trip on how much cash you have. Other issues as well. Heard alot of good things about this app. Yet, doesnt seem all the bugs are worked out......"
2015,5,"Wish I'm able to edit/customize main page menu items. Also, I wish some things here were available in their web version too.  i. e., flight track"
2015,5,"I like the search options and how results are displayed.  I haven't tried booking through the site, so I can't comment on that, but it was the only site that found a sale on American Airlines and saved me about $600!"
2015,2,What happened to the currency converter portion of the app?  I hate how you trick me into thinking that the update is an upgrade when it's really a downgrade taking away features.
2015,4,I've doing a lot of traveling lately and this has been my go to app. Love it. Only reason I didn't give this app 5 stars is because it freezes on me from time to time.
2015,4,"This app gives you the means to plan for your entire trip including flights, hotels and car rentals. You can also add hourly activities for the day. Incredible!"
2015,3,"Can see available flights but can NOT book. Kayak never connected to US Airways app. Unable to book my flight using your mobile app, Kayak!"
2015,4,The user interface is clean and simple. But I do wish there was a way narrow down searches by amenities like indoor pool spa or work out center.
2015,4,Having trouble finding flights out of my local international airport. Can't figure out why. When I use the web sight I can find them just fine...
2015,5,Easy used and immediate decision if need to purchase hotel and flight. Keep it up KAYAK...definitely used for my plan holidays...Thank you
2015,2,Go ahead and try searching for a round trip flight that begins on Mar. 17 2015 and returns Apr. 14 2015. You can't! Good luck!
2015,1,"Keeps telling me Internet is not available....but every other app and browser works fine,  just not kayak."
2015,2,"Like most, it is darn near impossible to search our even figure out what day you will get off of a flight. You'd think this would matter to at least somebody."
2015,4,"I like how this site shows it's prices over several days. That said, the Explore function doesn't always match the detailed search, but it is a good indicator of relative price between several destinations"
2015,1,"How can I use this app if it blocks itself from searching? Feedback send, but till it's fixed, one start rating and I'll be using Skyscanner."
2015,3,Not able to choose infant passenger when travelling as a family. Actual website has this feature...app is limited
2015,4,"It's a very useful and complete app, but it has a disadvantage: As far as I know, it isn't possible to look for flights and hotels at the same time. If this ""problem"" is solved, I will give 5 stars"
2015,5,My wife and I travel on vacation trips around the world. Kayak is one of the greatest apps for finding affordable flights and hotel's. It's a must have app for any traveler.
2015,1,3/1/15 ..Was working but recent update I (now) keep getting message cannot connect to internet ..when I am clearly connected !!!!! Just uninstalled and installed still same problem ..Back to Skyscanner ..Samsung Note 3
2015,2,Every time I try to explore it shut the app down. I checked for updates and there are none so im not sure what's going on.
2015,5,Love this app. Well designed and user friendly. Will be using it to book many trips.
2015,2,I can search for flights to where i want to go and i can search for hotels to where i am going but why doesnt the app let me search for packages together? You can do it on kayaks actual website but the app is almost pointless without it
2015,5,Daily alerts work great. The only thing is that you have to open the app for them to come up... Otherwise Prices are very accurate.
2015,4,Easy to use but do not like that I cannot see the trends of whether it's better to buy than to wait. You can see this on their regular website.
2015,5,Good tool to keep me informed. When on the move. . Frank Ryde.
2015,5,Helped me find a great deal for our flight to Miami!  So easy to use.
2015,3,When I go to book my car rental it freezes. I've refreshed 3 times. A little frustrating.
2015,5,"Subject says it all, but I have been using Kayak for years and the app is fantastic offering the same good prices with added convenience. Cookies concern me though..."
2015,4,It's great if you like to compare prices.  I wish it would show prices for all the airlines. Not just two or three.
2015,4,Results should be easier to filter. Too many listings with same airline. Grid would be much appreciated...
2015,5,Perfect app for pulling together a travel budget and dreaming. Works great on my Moto X.
2015,4,Like that I have plenty of options. Did find cheaper flights on another place by a thousand.
2015,4,Eels all trip details in one place. Flight tracking is a real plus. I frequently use this app for selecting flights.
2015,5,"This app works great prices,  great flexibility,  highly recommended to all.. happy traveling all......"
2015,5,Perfect example of a mobile app version of a website. Better than the site itself!
2015,3,"I like the alert function it's ability to use your current location to find an airport, but sometimes I find cheaper rates on the website."
2015,5,Easy to use and tracks all my travel details in one place. Thanks Kayak.
2015,5,Love this app! Fastest way to find great tickets! Saved me bundles getting first class!
2015,5,I love to travel a lot and for over 12 years Kayaks is my only source of search. ... I love it I always recommend it to everyone. ..
2015,3,Easy to use. Lots if options in the drop down menu.
2015,5,Why check a million sites when this does it for you.  The app is just as good as the desktop version
2015,1,And got redirected to American Airlines where I couldn't purchase a ticket. Why don't I just go directly to the airline.
2015,1,Can't login using my Google plus account. I should be able to because that's how I logged in on the website.
2015,4,Would love to get price alerts on my home screen BEFORE I open the app. Still needs vacation package search.
2015,2,"Shuts down every time ""Explore"" is selected. Would have been a great app otherwise."
2015,4,Never version works better. No complaints.
2015,4,I love this app so far. Very effective...provided me with all the info needed and the best prices
2015,4,Really appreciate the filters that Kayak has. Makes finding workable flights much easier.
2015,3,"Price filters do not carry back to the map, making the app almost useless to me."
2015,4,I use this regularly in my work to get my schedule organized. KAYAK is the best travel planner I've used so far.
2015,5,It works well and it is reliable. Nice little app
2015,3,"Maybe you can explain why you need access to my device ID the calls I've made, active calls, and the pictures on my device"
2015,4,Kayak is one of the best apps available in the appstore. It's my first choice for all my travel needs.
2015,4,Have mainly used it to keep an eye on prices when we are planning a trip. Find it very helpful.
2015,4,App is easier then the website but would be helpful if you could check flights from multiple airports
2015,2,I like this app I just wish there was an option to filter out 'multiple airlines' when searching for fights
2015,4,I wish there was a way to filter my options to only see pet friendly hotels.
2015,4,If it was  better with multicity flights I'd give it 5 but have to do it from the main site
2015,5,I use this app almost daily for everything from hotels and flights to the currency converter.  I simply can't live without it!
2015,3,Flights are extremely expensive compared to others such as Expedia and Skyscanner.
2015,5,I LOVE using this app. Very helpful for me. :)
2015,4,I ve been using kayak for years and they can get you the best deals
2015,4,Kayak is great but really need a few more of the filter options in the App like on the website.
2015,2,Flight alerts giving constant error message.  Please fix.
2015,4,"The app is very handy, especially if you're as forgetful and worrisome as I am."
2015,3,Currency exchange converter has been taken away with the latest update.
2015,5,Great for comparing flights. Kayak is the the best ... I've used it dozens of times to purchase flights
2015,4,Very useful application booked 2 flights already to Kenya using kayak  .
2015,3,Easy to use but filters would help narrow searching.
2015,1,Flight tracker: Shows flights as landed at the destination even before they departed from the starting airport..
2015,5,Love how it's an all in one app.  Can even check flight progress with it and I love that.
2015,4,"Good app, but still more limited than website."
2015,1,"The app only lets you log in with your Kayak or FB account, unlike the website."
2015,4,Very handy app . can book flights at real low prices.
2015,5,Kayak is my first choice for finding flights and hotels. It's easy to use.
2015,4,"I really like this app, it show a lot of low prices of trip."
2015,4,Handy to find out good deal but not always the best deal
2015,5,My favorite travel app. Very easy to use and convenient for all my travel needs.
2015,4,10 seconds to get flight  plus seating space currently available
2015,4,Sometimes i see some stupid prices such as $8000 economy but i like this app.
2015,5,Booked my whole US holiday with Kayak. Worked a dream 😂
2015,3,"Really helpful, hope the alerts where up to date"
2015,5,This is by far the best travel app I've ever used. As a novice traveler this app is a must.
2015,4,"For my search for Rome to Philadelphia, USA, it gave me Venice Marco polo airport to Philadelphia, USA. That airport is almost 6 hours away from Rome."
2015,5,This is my favorite app on which to search for flights. It searches all the major airlines and even some of the discount airlines.
2015,5,"For what I use it for. Flight searches and tracking, searching and trip sharing, too."
2015,5,"Been using Kayak for years, great tool for saving money on flights!"
2015,2,Often has technical issues booking on mobile site.
2015,1,It was the best part of the whole app if you're looking for the best prices in a month
2015,2,Why you removed the packing list? It was so useful 😞
2015,5,"Gets better all the time and, now, I don't need separate flight tracking app!"
2015,5,I enjoy this app I like the way the available flight show..and I can book my flight using the app fantastic...
2015,5,Dont leave home without it! Road warriors essential app!
2015,5,Great for information gathering.  Have not tried booking yet.
2015,5,"Best app ever, especially like the ticket alert."
2015,5,I use Kayak every time I need the best price on tickets and it never fails!

2015,5,"Is efficient,  save you time, money and easy to used."
2015,5,Im just checking flights for future travel and app seems to find great prices
2015,5,"Extremely easy to use , I almost never give 5 stars."
2015,5,"Kayak has become my personal travel assistant, very easy to access all my travel needs"
2015,5,"Long-time user, never had an issue."
2015,5,Really enjoy this ape has  saved me a lot of hassle traveling
2015,5,Still really the best place to start your airline ticket search

2015,5,Not always the cheapest but it's great to plan a trip!!
2015,5,"Great , plus weakly saved price checks ,thanks, all."
2015,5,"Have been using it for years, great app."
2015,4,Not as intuitive as the main site but not bad for on the go.
2015,5,Would be much better if we can save our search preferences

2014,1,"I am really disappointed in this app.. after i kept trying to book a flight it kept sending errors back.. when i decided to go to a better app and finally able to book.. i received a message on my email saying""thx for the purchase "" i got really mad.. cause cancelation fee is 50$ for kayak.. i paid 50$ cause i used this app.. how much do u wanna pay?"
2014,5,I particularly like the ability to email itineraries and have them create or add to existing trips; works quite well. I use the calendar integration to gave into itineraries automatically appear on my calendar.
2014,5,Used couple time to check fares. No problem here....
2014,5,Has tons of features and especially useful for frequent travellers.
2014,3,Where's my packing list?
2014,5,I Love Kayak!
2014,5,Best itinerary app
2014,1,"Facebook login is broken. My existing account is FB auth, so app is useless to me. App requests a set of permissions that do not include email, then requires that it got permissions including email. So even though I granted it everything it asked for, it fails and will not go past login."
2014,1,Update has ruined this app living in the UK prices show up in $ plus random airlines shown for the route  which causes the flight price to be ridiculous high.  Pleaee up date to fix issues
2014,4,"Always the lowest prices for my trips. Wish it would save my spot when I exit the app, so I don't have to wait for our to reload each time I return from taking notes."
2014,5,Wish the mobiles apps had the packages the full sites do but Kayak is the easiest and fastest I use. As simple as it is the plus minus one day feature has saved me thousands.
2014,5,But only thing why its showing always sanfransico automatically. I am in uk. After auto update its showing some other currency. Not showing pounds.
2014,1,"Slow, sluggish, and sometimes can't tell where I am or can't connect to the internet. (despite location and connectivity being fine in other apps)"
2014,5,Very fast and good ui. Easy for use. My recomendation
2014,5,"Very Good app, cheapest plane tickets. Thanks, it hepls a lot while travelling."
2014,3,Very helpful but crashes everytime I wanna use the explore option and leaves no ability to leave questions on alot of particular hotels without having to hunt down info and call.
2014,4,"Haven't used all the features yet, but what I have used works pretty good."
2015,5,One of the best travel application! I saved a ton of money here and without travel agent.  Highly recommend! 👍 👏 😀
2014,3,The app takes a long time to start. It's faster to just use the mobile website
2014,2,"I would love to use the app, it looks great, but I log in through Google+ and there isnt even an option for that, so the app is useless."
2014,5,Always finds the cheapest rooms... Not to sure about using it for flights. ... But I highly recommend it for hotels.
2014,5,And produces good collection of great deals. Highly recommended
2014,2,This app is very useful I love it. It has been crashing a lot lately and just keeps loading forever.
2014,4,They've been refining the app for a while and have now come out with a quality app that's easy to navigate and use.
2014,4,This can really get you cheap flights details to cross check wd other portals...gr8 enjoy
2014,3,"But app is looking dated, time for a material design refresh amirite!?"
2014,5,Truly awesome.  I travel a lot for work and private. This app is truly awesome.
2014,4,"I really liked the capability to view my scheduled trips, a flight tracker and a lot of useful things."
2014,5,Great app. AGUANTE RACING! #RacingCampeon
2014,4,Good so far..better than cheap o air based on non stop flights
2014,4,"Very helpful, let's me find cheap deals for my trips"
2014,4,"The key is that you can search with flexible departure days,  this can save  thousands."
2014,4,Can be frustrating at times when booking airline.  The price shown not available many times.
2015,4,Its s great app finds deals while on the run
2014,5,Has worked just like the full website. No complaints
2014,5,Absolutely the best way to find airline tickets...outstanding.
2014,5,"An efficient way to check for flights and hotels very fast, anywhere you are."
2014,4,This is my highest rating because no site is perfect
2015,5,I used this app and it is a good tool to use to plan trips when trying to opitimaize a trips best value travel time.
2014,5,"Booked my trip to Ireland, Seattle, and back again on here :)"
2014,5,Saves your search history and often finds what others won't.
2014,5,I love to travel by Kayak... nuff said!
2014,5,This app is very nice to have a great choice....
2015,4,Wish u could flight and hotel together
2014,5,It is by far the easiest way to find and book trips!
2014,5,Very usefull. Fastly plan your vecation
2014,5,Fast and uses the best site for tickets out there
2015,5,Excellent reference to know about prices. I always consult kayac.
2014,5,I do all my travel bookings and travel searches with this app.
2014,1,Keeps increasing the prices if I do the same search more than once
2014,4,Love the information it provides and full of options
2014,4,Good air fare search engine
2014,4,Good to maintain itinerary and travel updates

2014,5,Great
2014,5,Wow
2014,4,On Point with ALERTS!!!
2014,5,Use it all the time!
2014,4,"The Kayak app is really helpful in price comparisons on rental cars, flights and hotels. I just used the app to book my entire trip to California. The app has a packing list feature, but it does not save your list! You can add items and they won't show up on your list. Please fix it! I was really excited about this feature. In a recent update, the packing list feature has been deleted. Bring it back!"
2014,3,"I tried Kayak by looking for a hotel. It doesn't provide details like reviews and user ratings, or even amenities like wifi, etc. It's nice that it shows other sites' discounts,  but I have to use another site to finalize my choice."
2014,4,"Really well done app. Simple interface, fast, reliable. Nice job, guys. I'm docking you one star because the default of ""Current location to San Francisco"" is annoying. Let me configure that, mmmkay?"
2014,4,"The app gives the address of the hotel, but no phone numbers. It seems to want you to book reservations through the app. Otherwise I would have given it a 5 Star rating."
2014,4,"an extremely comprehensive travel tool, doesn't warrant 5 stars because the search functions are not exhaustive, but I love the ""my trips"" function. Way better than TripAdvisor"
2014,5,"Throughout the years I have experienced that most of the time Kayak will get you the best deal available, flight or rental either way its an app you can really depend on and save your time and money. Would highly recommend to anyone!!!!"
2014,2,Was working well until it started showing me fares in dollars and not pound sterling. Tried in vain to find a settings that would let me change the currency back to pound sterling. Not found so I'm giving this a low rating
2014,1,Had to remove it promptly-it made the internet on my phone run slow whether I used wifi or the network. As soon as I deleted the ap & rebooted my phone it was fine again. Had kayak on another phone & it worked slow on it but it didn't seem to interfere as much.
2014,5,Very handy and quick results. Sometimes not accurate. Other sites giving better accurate results sometimes. May be app displays cached info?. Anyhow thanks. I like this app.
2014,5,"Great companion for us, world-wanderers, to help us travel in a relaxed and organized way. Great UI and tools added! I really liked it!"
2014,4,I use Kayak all the time to find great flight and hotel deals.   I've tried other sites but always come back to Kayak!
2014,5,Love it. Very simple and very useful. I almost exclusively use the mobile app rather than the desktop version. 👍👌
2014,5,I use it to organize and share all my work travel. It's amazing how it understands and properly categorizes trips from emails and attachments. Very handy to have 1 place to look for all trip info.
2014,5,Awesome app. Sometimes I like it better then the websites. Update: -1 star... Where did packing list feature go?
2014,2,Booking problems through app. Freezes all the time. Super annoying cuz I don't know if it's taken my money. Ugh.
2014,5,"Trying to find a flight from Dallas, to Saint Johns, NL, CA, is hard when searching for a good price. I've booked my flight for $550 with one layover. I don't think I'd find that without some help."
2014,4,Use this app to book flights and cars all the time. Only thing lacking for me would be an option to pick flights based on arrival time.
2014,5,If you haven't used the trips feature in kayak you are missing out in the best free tool for traveling anywhere.  Check it out and thanks Kayak.
2014,5,Great system I tend to bounce around and try differnt sites however I've come to find out kayak is spot on 97 percent of the time. Of course if your feet on the ground where your headed then it's cheaper.
2014,4,I've tried this app a few times while pre planning my trips and I can say that I have no problem with trust fully with my travel plans.
2014,5,I love the My Trips.  Wish it would let you zoom in on original emails.  My eyes can't always read the real small text.
2014,4,Easy to navigate. Love being able to find various deals in one place.
2014,4,Usually has the best and most reliable prices. Package choices are not comprable to Expedia. Otherwise great app.
2014,5,I hate booking anything but this app made it real easy for me... A must have for all the simple guys out there who want to select and go
2014,5,"I use kayak for most flights, and some hotels and car rentals.  Easy interface."
2014,5,Time to live. It so easy and fast. I feel like I am dealing with a travel agent.
2014,5,Always has best prices is simple to use. Thanks for a great app
2014,1,Says price has changed you need to reselect but it won't let me book.
2014,1,Couldn't set a flight return beyond the calendar month. Useless.
2014,1,Even though I select the city of Washington DC it still gives me results for Arlington Virginia DCA airport
2014,4,Works well but needs more options for dates.
2014,5,Saved $110 on a trip in December! Thanks a million
2014,3,Can not add children in flight search! There isn't any option for children
2014,2,Would be good to be able to select children and infants thus get a true total price.
2014,4,It is very good; but the travelers entry must provide more option for child and enfants not only adults
2014,4,"Can be a little buggy if you get deep into the functionality of it, but overall a great app."
2014,2,"The app has been ""simplified"" and some of the best filtering tools were removed."
2014,3,What happened to the price/buzz trends feature? Pls bring it back
2014,4,Finds hotels and flights with simple menu. Good for frequent travellers
2014,1,Just installed the app to find a rental car for the weekend & it does not work.
2014,4,Don't listen to anyone else. This is an awesome app!
2014,3,They removed the currency exchange will give five stars when it is returned
2014,3,We need the option to exclude the unwanted airlines in the price alert!
2014,5,Great one place comparison shopping. Do have to look up Southwest separately as they are not included in kayaks results.
2014,5,After trying to book a flight on Expedia the price shot up 100 bucks at checkout.  Tried this app and got the original price I saw.
2014,3,I just wish you could pay luggage fees on this site.
2014,4,Useful since it provides substantial vendor info in one place.
2014,4,"bring back""buzz""! Otherwise, great app"
2014,5,Quick & simple to use. Helps me find hotels & compare ratings.
2014,5,It's the easiest and fastest!  This app has helped my family and I have wonderful vacations!!!
2014,5,"A very useful kayak to row through the sea of travel needs, keep up the good job guys!"
2014,2,Finds issues with the internet connectivity when other apps have no problem connecting.
2014,4,App sometimes switches to a different language and currency on flight checkout.
2014,5,I've been using KAYAK for almost 3 years and it's always reliable and trip planning has never been so easy
2014,4,"No economic flight e.g. fly dubai,  nas air"
2014,2,Where did the buzz section go. Please bring back
2014,5,"So easy to use, I've booked most of my flights through this app."
2014,5,Great for finding your best deal and let's you know when to buy love it!
2014,4,V good. Need to include Southwest as well
2014,5,They finally made an app that extremely easy to use and very helpful. This is what you want
2014,4,Pretty Useful and helpful..
2014,5,I use every thing on it but my favorate is the hotel finder and flight tracker

2014,5,It is very helpful would be even better if we can store our FF numbers
2014,4,Working well. Useful for travel..

2014,5,"A bit low sometimes, but a good app."
2014,4,A good way to compare rates on the go.

2014,5,I use this app every time I a looking for flights.

2014,5,I never buy tickets without Kayak...

2014,5,Yes
2014,3,"Worth trying when all you have is a phone, but often listed prices are much higher once you start booking. Also once in Berkeley, booked with avail hotel late afternoon  , received confirmation, charged my card, then got to desk and they had my confirmation , but no room available. I was told that info was not getting to kayak fast enough. Plus priceline states 3 star hotels of national brand, then gives you an old remodeled motel. No money back or apology."
2014,4,"One thing need to improve.  I know that in some similar apps,  there is integration with Callender.  I'm mean if the app can automatically create the trip with all the details in my calendar,  it will be great.  Thanks"
2014,3,I was trying to schedule a flight from Dec 23 to Feb 2- way too much effort ro get it to keep the date range. Why not just have 2 drop down menus: one for departure date and one for return!
2014,5,Great way to quickly price flights. Easy to customize options with multiple filters. One of the few apps I prefer over the full website.
2014,5,"Loving it. Rush it more than other travel apps. It's quick, easy, and accurate with the website. It even has easy fare price alert settings."
2014,5,Very useful and helpful. Easy access to all information about your flights on your phone
2014,3,"I don't like how the departure & return are booked together. Let me choose when I leave then pick when I return, I do not enjoy the groupings"
2014,4,i find it useful even if i still am having difficulty exploring the functionalities of this apps.. this is my go to page when canvassing for flights
2014,1,It is very time consuming to use and back button will send you back to the stone - edge.
2014,4,"When you ""share this flight"" via text it doesn't load the correct flight. Just takes you to the kayak home page"
2014,4,Most efficient app ever used for bookings of flights and hotels...
2014,4,Haven't used in forever but it looks like they made exceptional updates
2014,4,Great to have this tool in pocket anytime you're hitting the road.
2014,4,A nice app which is rather helpful....I would highly recommend it for travellers!
2014,4,Excellent if you can extend +/-2 days range
2014,4,"Needs a ""home airport"" option for 5 stars!"
2014,3,It's ok but pictures are not showing up
2014,5,DON'T USE TRAVELOCITY IT'S A RIP OFF.....KAYAK IS PERFECT!
2014,5,Best app I have used so far for finding air fares.
2014,3,I cannot find a way to find hotels with a pool or balcony
2014,5,"Easy to use, good info,  quick and useful."
2014,4,Except it cleared all my settings when it was updated
2014,1,Doesn't work force close
2014,4,Great use of my time.
2014,5,"Does everything as expected, fast."
2014,4,Better domestically than internationally.
2014,5,Excellent app for searching airline flights.
2014,4,Could do with minor improvements.

2014,5,Senior Corporate Refrigeration Engineer
2014,4,Use full
2014,1,Huh !! !!
2014,5,Porterbutler
2014,5,Does what.......
2014,1,I liked Kayak until they included flights to Dayton when I'd asked for flights to Columbus. They didn't ask me whether I wanted the nearby airports feature on (and Dayton is not nearby). They didn't notify me that that feature was on. They didn't warn me that some of the flights they were showing went somewhere other than where I'd indicated I wanted to go. They provide me with no obvious way to keep this from happening again. I've uninstalled the app.
2014,2,"I so badly want to like this buzz feature,  but it doesnt reload pricing.  it loads the first time and those prices remain for all months.  I feel like if one person working on this app would ever test it,  they would notice immediately.  Guess they don't use it :/"
2014,1,"I have an S5 on Verizon. The app can't handle screen rotation (pages have to be reloaded if you rotate screen). More egregiously, it utterly fails at checkout: the touch buttons for travel insurance do not work and the app will not allow you to book a ticket since no insurance option had been selected. Don't download."
2014,4,"Why use an app to plan your trip versus the web? I would say it's to synch your other management tools like Google calendar and agenda. I ought to be able to search flights, book one, then share it to my social and automatically enter it into my calendar. This app searches and filters flights better than anything else on Play but doesn't come through when you want to book, share, and record your travel plans."
2014,2,"When my wife took off on an airline trip, after the first leg KAYAK updated me with three identical (word for word) emails notifying me that the plane had landed.  Also if you have a ""two leg"" trip and you want to see status of 2nd leg, the menu is not clear how to get past 1st leg of flights.  Also I found it slow to update take off times. Secondly, it is difficult to CHANGE flight information if you change beginning or ending date of a trip.  Kayak needs some more testing before they release software."
2014,4,"Kayak is great for booking, but is one tool among many. Keep in nind it doesn't have every single airline and searching a little further can find you a cheaper price. The filters are amazing, they help you find the right flight"
2014,3,"Needs improvement. Took several attempts to book a hotel.  I suspect I was trying to book a room that didn't really exist, but really not sure what was up. Searching was good, though. Maps could be more functional. Navigation could be cleaner."
2016,5,90% of my flights are booked using Kayak.  Easy to navigate UI with all the useful editing & sorting features.  Occasionally Kayak doesn't list some of the smaller regional airlines in South America and Asia.... but that is where Skyscanner is beneficial.
2014,2,"Why have a search history button when it doesn't remember what you've searched?  You should be able to save searches.  The search history doesn't work on my phone or my Galaxy tab II.  Also,  it freezes sometimes."
2014,5,"This app does it all. Though I usually use it for its flexible dates search, the airline engine crawls deep into the airfare system to find the best deals. It gives many filters and even a prediction on whether the airfare will rise or fall. Best overall travel app, IMO."
2014,2,When I went to use this app to book the flight it just wouldn't process the airline's screen. Honestly I found the same deal on the airline's app anyway and their app worked like clockwork. So sad cause I would use this app if it let me book the flight.
2014,1,This app took me ona ride first my tick was 600 then almost while I had put my cc info it refreshed and price changed to 770. Great funk this.  I smell greed I'll hold off looking here again. Priceline owns then all anyways
2014,2,I relied on Kayak for a while but it doesn't update soon enough and I'm finding better deals on other sites.  The mobile app doesn't even show the same rate my PC shows. What's up with that?
2014,4,Love the pricing Infos and comparative analyses. Only wish -please set a currency change in the App settings. English language is not always used by Great Britain Pound users.
2014,4,"The only flaw is that the 'wait' suggestion gets you expecting a lower fare which may not always happen. Also on some routes, Skyscanner shows cheaper flights. But, nonetheless, it is totally ammazing, user-friendly, fast and CHEAP.... Well done!"
2014,4,"I usually love this app and I've recommended Kayak to everyone I know, but lately I've been having issues with your packing list part off the program. It doesn't save my list after I've closed the program and it doesn't remember what I check as having packed! This flaw is incredibly frustrating!"
2014,2,Cumbersome app that rarely works properly. I get no push alerts unless I physically log into app which in and of itself defeats the purpose. I set my views for non-stop only and get everything else under the sun.
2014,1,"Q. When is a widget not a widget? A. When it's a KAYAK widget.  The widget use to give information discreetly in the widget.  Now w/ latest update, the widget functions as an oversized icon button that opens to the main app.  Why? Please return it, or don't call it a widget."
2014,1,Good app gone bad. Last two updates have made it useless for what I do... Track all flights arriving at local airport
2014,4,This app helps satisfy my vacation searching addiction. The only problem is when I'm entering flight start and end dates the month on the calendar does not display correctly (always shows current month)
2014,4,"Stable software, nice sorting tools. Price on hotel rate might not be actual. Check on taiwan. Love the map, reviews of hotels. Great job"
2014,4,Pretty good. Have only used for flights so far. Wish searching for flights would also show a calendar of least expensive days to fly to chosen destination.
2014,4,This is the only app I use to find the lowest airfare. It works best with lots of variations. I wish it would alert anytime of the day fare drops. It seems to do it once a day
2014,5,Excellent app. They've really done a great job of bringing most of the PC features to the app. If only they linked TripAdvisor reviews to the listings - then it would really be awesome.
2014,2,"The old flight tracker worked way better. I'm sitting on a plane delayed an hour, and its showing that we are arriving.  Not nearly as good, and that was my primary use for this."
2014,5,"This app is especially nice to enable day dreaming, because most of the time when I use it, it's only just for that. Not trying to run it down or anything. It works. Is just me."
2016,2,"Installed the app and liked the search functionality. Results were great. But attempting to actually book something resulted in failure after failure. ""API Error"" and ""sorry..."" messages were not ideal. Unistalled."
2014,2,"I usually love this app, but I have a complain about fare alerts. I had been holding off on buying a flight because the alert prices were consistent, but once I started searching to actually buy the flight, prices increased dramatically. Don't rely on fare alerts."
2014,4,The app does what it's supposed to do... but i find limitations on selecting the desired departure or arrival time. I can't either select flight combinations as I do on the desktop. Other than that the app is really good.
2014,4,"I love the trip tracking feature of Kayak, it's helpful for business travellers like myself. I'd love if you guys could add mobile sign in with google"
2014,5,"I love kayak, I think it really does have done of the cheapest flight options. And the app is nice, a bit confusing at first, but I got to know it and now it's no trouble."
2014,4,Since updating this app you cannot now search flights using their prefix (ie BA 123 or KQ 456). You now have to know which airline the prefix refers to. NOT HELPFUL! Please fix!
2014,5,"I've been using Kayak for at least 6 or 7 years and I LOVE the app! No matter where I am, I can jump on and find, literally, the cheapest tickets! Thank you for giving me the ability to buy tickets spur of the moment....like in my doctor's office, at work, out of the country, etc. (And yes, we've bought airline tickets in each of those situations!)  Thank you again!!"
2014,5,Don't find much better prices than on kayak and the app works great. Some limits the smaller names for airlines where you can find great deals but overall my travel website of choice.
2014,5,"This site compares all of the major hotel booking sites like priceline, Expedia and many more. No need to look anywhere else I highly recommend using this site for your hotel search and when booking it. My 100% true and honest opinion. Hope this helps"
2014,5,"Great app. Syncs with my email calendar. Can set reminders. Very very good, especially if you are a frequent traveller."
2014,5,definitely has the best prices for example I live in Florida and I can get a round trip to canada back for just 400 dollars if that is not saying amazing deals then I don't know what is.  :)
2014,4,Worked great until last update. Currency converter no longer works. Fix that and it will be back to 5*
2014,5,"Excellent job in providing lot of options... Could improve by analyzing wider range of flights, locations and deals for better results.."
2014,4,More filters would be helpful. Maybe a map that shows all the hotels in your vicinity ? It's fast though ! Best hotel app on my phone.
2014,5,great stuff. nice options and save of history . files and sorts keep it very useful. it is my first option to look into flights
2014,4,"This app. works well in my point of view. However, it should also update a revised information to my organized app."
2014,1,book a flight for 694 it says so on the site/app all amoung includes taxes and feeds they sent me a receipt for 806.20 WTF really no F***ing way I am agree for that. App also kept crashing not reliable whatsoever.
2014,4,Monitoring flights to distant places... a full evaluation will be given once we see if it works like we hope it will.
2014,4,"Nerds. Needs ability to search several airports at once for cities with multiple airports. Like the Explorer feature, hope it is expanded on the app."
2014,5,This app has so many great features. Is probably a function of kayaks website itself but it's nice to see that app has it all too.
2014,4,"Very helpful app, especially for my complex travel itinerary. I wish Sections were interconnected. Developers need to make the app more integrated."
2014,5,Been using this for a while now. Quite simply the best app for flight bookings and very convenient to use thanks to neat UI design and availability of multiple filters.
2014,3,"Good app, but it could have more options in hotels and flight search. But it is fast and never freeze."
2014,2,"Lately, I'm not able to purchase my tickets properly through the app.....  I get all the way through the process to have it kick me back to the original booking info page..... It's really frustrating...."
2014,5,Hands down! The absolute best app available to book your next trip. Nothing else comes close. I love it. It's the only one I use today for booking.
2014,5,I love this application.  You can find everything in one place and the fact that it don't update every minute of the day is what I love even more about it.
2014,5,"I use it regularly to make last minute flight bookings. Just last week, I arrived at the airport first and THEN used Kayak to book my flight. It's that convenient."
2014,5,My 1st time using this app. I use several others to s who has the better deal for my travel budget and Kayak smashed it this trip.
2014,5,Except probably for the vacation deals. Didn't see any option to search for combined flight+hotel+car packages.
2014,3,App has more info on iPhone fir flight tracker. Wish they would make it the same for android.
2014,4,"Violates Canadian Anti Spam Laws regarding ""email/contact me"" check box being prechecked on signup. Could face persecution by CRTC Otherwise no complaints"
2014,1,The date selection for round trip under the name of intuition has been made crappy.. Plese have a simple date selection instead of the current draggg...
2014,5,I love this app. I booked a round trip flight for very cheap and everything went great. Definitely using this from now on and strongly recommend it for all your trips.
2016,4,Great app for finding tickets within a small time frame. It lacks the month view and weekend view available on the site. Please add that for 5 stars.
2014,5,Offered the best airline tickets... Also included checklists and currency converter.... Thank You!
2014,5,"I've used this app extensively,  and never more so than the past 4 weeks that I've been travelling in India!  There are lots of tiny domestic airlines in India and this app does an amazing job of searching them."
2014,5,Very easy to use. Works flawlessly. Filtering is very user friendly and accurate.
2014,5,"Great ""Trips"" feature and contact information for airline confirmations. I was not lost one bit along the way."
2014,5,I use this app all the time to look at airfare and the flight tracker when flying.  Filtering airfare is really easy.  I don't think this app has ever crashed on me.
2014,2,"I love Kayak's website, and this app is good for searching flights, but every time I try to book using the app some bug just keeps giving me error messages."
2014,4,Just joined but it has been great so far. Easy to use and lots of options.
2014,3,"I'm glad they added the ""my trip"" functionality to rival TripIt.  I still prefer to do actual bookings from the desktop site though."
2014,5,Great for planning any trip. Simple and easy. Thanks! :)
2014,2,I want one hotel room for my family of five. Not two rooms. Why is that not an option?
2014,3,"You're on the right track, if it had more options like on the site, i.e. look at flights by time would make it better."
2014,5,I've booked two trips on the web site and now the mobile app I can plan trips on the go. Easy fast simple and comparative quotes what's not to love
2014,5,"I love it! I can look up any flight go back and make changes usually see how many seats still available, etc. I really appreciate it!"
2014,4,Quick and easy to use. Just wish it would allow you to search for the things you want. Like pets or a Ron with a Jacuzzi
2014,5,"Very useful tool. I only use it for flights, haven't tried cats or hotels"
2014,5,it is really easy book your vacations. This app also finds deals with the real web page of the airline.
2014,5,Kayak is my favorite travel search engine. It searches must of the others and saves me time. Great filtering and easy to use.
2016,4,Fantastic app does exactly what I need. Very user friendly and helpful.
2014,4,Good app to compare prices. Could use better filtering features.
2016,5,Easy to use. Travel all over frequently and the app is super helpful in finding what I need.
2014,5,Very intuitive. Better options than other more popular travel apps.
2014,5,Kayak shows results from other sites but doesn't really need to since Kayak is typically cheaper than the rest (often cheaper than the airline itself).
2014,2,"Great at finding a hotel, terrible at booking it. When trying to select the room, it would just keep refreshing the same selection screen."
2014,5,This is my go to app when I am searching for flights. App interface is easier to use than their web site.
2014,5,Great search functionality and features. Easy to view and so many different search options.
2014,4,"App works great for the majot airlines, but doesn't show small airlines like virgin and spirit that have the cheapest flights usually"
2014,2,"2+ stops acceptable? Turkish lira, anyone? From London? Exactly."
2014,5,Love it very accurate cheapest prices even cheaper than my company discount prices keep up the good work! Save us more money
2014,5,"My only improvement would be to install multi-city booking on the app. Otherwise I love it. Smooth, easy, reliable."
2014,5,Gets you a large variety of results quickly. Good interface design.
2014,3,"Set up a price alert. Everyday app said price hadn't changed, searched for same flight today and price was up $130."
2014,3,I wanna buy child ticket but there is no option. ... fix it!
2014,1,"There are required fields (gender) that are unselectable when buying tickets, so you can't actually complete check out."
2014,5,Booked many flights. Best prices and multi city trips are also possible. Great app
2014,5,It's simple with little options. Really great for quick searches.
2014,5,Great app. Easy to use and effective... Must have for all travelers.
2014,5,"A very convenient way to plan your trip, track flights and manage all other related matters such as find your way at the airport and much more."
2014,4,It would be nice to find out all the douches on sale from a city to a few random places without having to always enter a destination.
2014,5,Glad to have this app on the phone. It is very helpful!
2014,3,Found flights $100 cheaper with same search criteria with diff app. Bye bye Kayak.
2014,4,Missing the BlackBerry Travel App... buy Kayak does a pretty good job!!! Updatrs and confirmation numbers always on point.
2014,5,I love that is has that feature.  It is getting me to Cali a lot cheaper.
2014,4,"Once in a while it hiccups and returns no results. Re-run the search, no problem."
2014,5,I got a $52 one way plane ticket from Chicago to Atlanta!!!! I'm sold!! Best travel app ever...
2014,5,This app. is great.  Perfect prices and stars for what we need...
2016,1,I will not use or update this app until intrusive permissions are removed!
2014,4,Easy to scan through multiple hotels at once just remember that deposit is not accounted for so keep that in mind.
2014,4,Really a very convenient program for flight and holiday planning. Quick and accurate respones.
2014,5,"Great app, it let's you book flights individually step by step with selecting the Date and destination where to fly! Especially great for Multiple trips!"
2014,4,"I wish all carriers were included in searches, though, as well as choosing multiple airports to fly in and out of."
2014,3,It'll be better if the software can remember my last time search.
2014,3,I wish I could plan a trip and price it out and then save it it I could do that I would give it five stars
2014,5,Using it only to search for flights. Works good.
2014,5,It's a great app great service. Just make sure you have it set to compare against all the travel sites and not just 1.
2014,4,But flight status sometimes doesn't load. Fix that and it's a 5-star app.
2014,5,Use it all the time. Just wish you could filter the results by frequent flyer program like the website.
2014,2,"Will search and search and nothing comes up, or it will just show you your last search instead."
2014,4,"Haven't booked anything yet (not traveling at the moment), but good for checking prices so far."
2014,5,"The functionality is on par, if not easier than the website. Some of the more complex filtering is lost, but that is to be expected."
2014,5,I use My Trips to keep all my trips; just forward to Kayak. It shows up as an itinerary on Kayak with all the details.
2014,4,I wish that I could create a full trip without having to sign in through Google or through kayak it should be automatic.
2014,4,"Good app to find flights, but I still have constant issues with the price alerts."
2014,4,"I like the weekly updates on prices, I have tried other sites, KAYAK, by far is the best"
2014,4,"It works great, but a miss some functionalities like hotel + flight packages."
2014,4,"Have almost all features from desktop site, except e day flexible table."
2014,4,I am quite impressed by the info but found better price directly from the hotel.
2014,1,The permissions required just crossed the line.  Bye bye bottom feeders.
2014,2,"Regularly missing my trips, doesn't seem to sync or retain"
2014,4,This app really provides you with good flight options to suit your needs
2014,5,Excellent application if there was six starts I'll have given it. You guys are awesome
2014,4,Occasionally fares are not as low as given but still my top choice for searching air fares.
2014,5,I even prefer the mobile app over the website. Great for comparing multi site quotes.
2014,1,Shows flights that are +$1500 expensive compared to other sites.
2014,5,Best app ever. I love it. I recomend it! :)
2014,5,I've used this app to book all of my hotels. The comparisons are great!

2014,5,The prices were accurate and everything runs smooth.  Go Kayak!!!
2014,1,not impressed at all. Don't waste your time...
2014,4,But it Doesn't seem to always keep me signed in on my account
2014,5,I never had to search on other sites for better prices. This is kind of one stop destination for me to search for flighs.
2014,4,Sometimes I get less results than if I search on the website.
2014,5,I use this app when planing a trip and is great how inexpensive hotels or trips can cone up for so low prices.

2014,1,"Flight tracker is useless. I loved this app on my old iPhone where it let's you select when the airplane departed on the flight tracker. That's the only reason I got this app. On the Android version, you can't change the date. My mom left at 11pm on Sept 29th. I wanted to track her flight. It won't allow me to select Sept 29th as the departure date of the aircraft so it only gives me flights that leave and land on the same day, not my mother's flight. Even after putting in +/- days it defaults to exact."
2014,3,"My three biggest gripes: 1) App times out on a hotel search seemingly randomly. After an indeterminate time it no longer displays room quotes on a given hotel's page, thus you no longer have the ability to book without killing and relaunching the app and initiating a new search. 2) Tapping on the right will scroll the results to the bottom on a hair trigger (argh!). 3) The lack of photos, reviews and ratings is abysmal. Wound up switching to Trip Advisor to avoid further frustration and find better info."
2014,4,"Fantastic app. In an effort to consolidate a few important travel related functions, things I would like to see added would be the ability to view multi currency conversions on a single page and a budget tracker (preferably with a split-by-person function). Thanks :-)"
2014,3,"I'm not using any of the features of Kayak, but just an alternative to TripIt.  Doesn't automatically scan my mail to build itineraries but is quick and accurate once I forward them to be input.  One touch airport maps is pretty handy."
2014,3,"There must be a better tool/site, but I still use it regularly to search for cheap flights. It would be great if the app included that ""Explorer"" feature that they have on their website.  Not the best but not the worst either."
2014,4,"Just make sure you have the right city when searching hotels! When you modify a search, it sometimes will go back to the default of ""current location,"" which is not usually what I want when searching hotels! But overall the app is easy to search on, and I've found some great deals!"
2014,4,"App works very well, but should be upgrades to feature the full range of filters and options as the website. Also, the map has never worked right. Everything bunches together and zooming is difficult."
2014,1,"When you do a search, the dates do not appear on the results.  huh?  If I could only see date and price and airport in search a result, now that's a useful app!  Really maybe let me fly in out of the same airport.  How about give me a app I can use."
2014,5,"I used to check multiple sites, but after a while I noticed all the results were the same, and if there were any deals, kayak has them. Easy to use, and does it's job well. No complaints."
2014,3,Cant beat it's price search capabilities but the app has it's downfalls too. Just booked a flight and cant use the app to look at my flight information on past purchases. It should have a tab for purchased flights and their details. Instead i have to wait for an email and go that route.
2014,4,"It says unfortunatley kyak has stopped, then it starts the second time.overall it does a good job keeping information in one place. Hotels are tougher but most go into the app ok. Once the flight loaded into the app was the wrong flight. Bizarre. I have not found anything better to date."
2014,5,"I always start my search on kayak. It gives me the overview of all my options. Wish it had more flexibility on finding cheap fares when date of departure is irrelevant. (As in planning a vacation far in advance, where the exact date is not important in lieu of finding a cheap fare)"
2014,4,"Not that stylish but it is great to search cheap flights etc. Flight tracker too which can be handy! Clever, but some search options could be made a little easier! Good app though!"
2014,1,I got a nice long list of hotels.  All but one said call for price.  I don't need Kayak to call every hotel in town (except one).  I can do that with a phone book.
2014,4,I have used this site to buy tickets to fly home. Never had a problem with ticketing or price. Times are sometimes inconveniant. It would be nicer to pick departure seperate from returns instead of getting it as a packaged deal.
2014,4,Much better now. I have all the features. Nice. But I would like to but from the app itself instead of the airline website which very often is not design for my phone browser.
2014,5,"It's a great app! 2 things I have noticed, when your redirected to another airline site (especially United and American airlines) the kayak price is mysteriously no longer available! Just pick your booking through Kayak whenever possible. The second, I think sometimes airlines pay to show up near the top. Make sure to scroll through because you might find something a bit cheaper further down the list. Overall though it's an accurate and fast site."
2014,5,This is a must have app if you're a frequent traveler. Not only does it arrange your travels but you can choose to have it send you an SMS regarding the status of your flight. 5 stars.
2014,5,"Great app ... very happy with this for sometime now. ...desktop user at 1st. Like the ability to save and store data, alerts etc. Also very easy to share trip plans across multiple media platforms."
2014,3,"When I'm on the app, essentially perfect! *But, the auto alert function only 'kind of' works. When I open the app, I get an instant notification, which is definitely useful, but I never ever get a auto notification if I don't open the app. PLEASE FIX !!!"
2014,4,"This is really nice app and did a lot more than I expected. so good suprise. however, my only criticism is that I can't filter flights by departure time from places I'm departing from. Hopefully this will be considered later."
2014,5,Verry good app for finding the perfect holidays.  So many options fabulous.  One suggestion why can you not do holiday packages.  It will be great.
2014,1,"I've used this app in the past with great success, but recently I will attempt to book a flight and I'll get a message saying ""This fare is no longer available"". Please fix for my HTC One and I'll provide a better rating."
2014,5,"Before using Kayak, I used to spend HOURS scanning almost every online travel website I knew. (By the way, I HATED doing this.) I used to spend so much time looking up multiple websites for affordable airfare, car rentals etc. Kayak does it all for you in 1 place. Just put in the info of when you want to go and come back and BOOM...couple seconds later you're going on vacation! I especially enjoy the fact you can email your bookings to Kayak and they'll make a trip itenerary for you so you don't forget."
2014,5,I always use Kayak to check prices on hotels and flights. The reviews from hotels are very helpful. I like that even if kayak doesn't have the lowest price it shows who does. Works great for me
2014,3,"Love the app. BUT, you have to check out and make sure the prices are the same before you make your decision because I've been close to booking and found out my trip to Utah was going to be an additional $100 because they posted the price wrong :(  and sometimes it's more expensive on kayak."
2014,5,I had this app on my iPhone and had to make sure it was on my Samsung s4   works great I can upload my trip information. I can track my love ones flight information. Check currency information airline fees. Just a great app.
2014,4,"Great App, even if just for flight schedules. Has saved me arriving for pick ups too early, tracks and advises delays in-flight. awesome!"
2014,4,I use this all the time to search for flights/ hotels. Works great. Wish it didn't want so much of my information.
2014,5,Very useful and user friendly.  Wish you could have a place to store all frequent flyer numbers and preferred rental  numbers and even better if you could suggest using them to gain points when reserving through Kayak.
2014,5,"With Simple search results, I used it to book a friends room after I had used another site to find mine..  My friend is getting the better deal in 1/10 of the time."
2014,4,"Great application, you get to see how much using your frequent flyer airline is costing. I wonder why they need to view my address book and photos?"
2014,5,"Great!!! My experience so far with KAYAK has been ""the price is the price"". No cost discrepancies that other travel mobile apps have. You know the scenario: When you're on one of their competitor's apps and you select a ticket. 5 -10 mins after you select that ticket and proceed to purchase it, that same ticket is radically more expensive than the original price shown. I LOVE THAT THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED TO ME ON KAYAK!!!"
2014,2,Mobile app different and not as good as desktop. Good for a quick check but for real information you need to go online.  Plus they need access to my photos? ?? Really???
2014,1,Cant track yesterday (red eye) flights. Difficult to search airlines.                     Bring back the older version!
2014,4,I give it for stars only because it doesn't process data as day add I'd like it to. Could be my wireless connect or my phone though....
2014,5,"Kayak's app provides the same options as the website, but with more ease. Love the mobile alerts on flight price drops too ;)"
2014,4,"Booked a trip to Krakow, Poland. Kayak consistently found the best hotel deals. Now my travel app of choice"
2014,4,What's better? Southwest and Jet blue omitted. Notifications have some issues running in background. Fine application overall.
2014,3,Like alot of the features but when it came time to pay it kept jumping me around. I gave up and went to orbitz and got a better price.
2014,4,This new interface with Hotel member don't work for me. It's easy to have the best rates when you just change the star rating on the same hotel.
2014,4,Found this app while downloading Expedia and i think is the best ever... could have the flight and hotel package to book at the same time. That would make it 5 star!!
2014,4,This app works well for searches and itinerary organization. It's easy to forward reservations to the site so complex itineraries are easy to follow. Price alerts are easy to create.
2014,5,"Easy to save itineraries for entire trips, just forward your email to trips at kayak and it shows up here. Very cool, works offline, too."
2014,3,A little disappointed.  I would like to be able to search non stop flights only and search for hotels with specific amenities such as pet friendly. To plain where's the wow.
2014,5,"With kayak one doesn't need anything else. In addition to all the plane fares of a particular route, the listing of the hotel room rates of all the prominent hotel booking engines is the best part where price comparisons of all the providers can be seen together. Highly recommended for the frequent flyer wishing to save money on travel costs."
2014,1,"I recently booked 2 tickets to peru for $2094. I later found the same flights for about $350 less!! Normally websites like orbits and priceline will do a price match but kayak wont. Their reason is because they are a ""search engine"". if you do use this website or app, only use it for price comparison but not to book!!!!"
2014,4,For the avid traveler this app definitely gets the mental gears moving. You may find better deals elsewhere but this app gives you the best starting point for comparison.
2014,5,"This app has always done what it's been built to do. Super easy, no fuss and no reason to hunt for bargains on all the other sites out there. Five stars!"
2014,5,Always find the best rates and the app makes it much faster and more convenient to do so! Love the price alert feature as well!
2014,5,"Not quite as good as the web interface, but it has everything I need when I'm on the go. It just keeps getting better and better with each release."
2014,5,I always use kayak to search for flights. Prices are always low and the search options are extensive. They list all the flight companies I want to compare.
2014,4,"I've used it several times now. While I prefer the fuller features of the full site, it's not too bad."
2014,5,I love this app. It does exactly what I need it to do without any real problems. It's easy to use and yields much better results than if I had to search each individual site myself.
2014,5,Love being able to search airfare days ahead/before for savings... my trips feature is great too.
2014,5,"Love to use. As a travel enthusiast, i get everything in one place: flights, car hire and hotels at the best price. What else do you need."
2014,5,Kayak always helps me track my friends flights when I'm picking them up from the airport. I also use it to get info on my business travels. Absolutely love this app!
2014,2,"When booking a hotel through the app, it limits the available rooms you can choose from for a given hotel. I wanted a King size bed but the app would only show me Queen size beds."
2014,4,I enter our holiday details on My Trips and get 2 great benefits: family has full access to where we are while away AND we get a paperless itinerary with reminders.  It is very quick to complete even for complex trips
2014,5,I absolutely love using this and I travel a lot and this is my number one way to get the best prices. I'm looking at some of the bad ratings for kayak and I have no idea what they are talking about.  This app is perfect.
2014,5,"I am constantly looking at flights and hotels. The only issue I've EVER ran into with kayak is failure to send confirmation notice. Other than that, it hasn't let me down."
2014,5,I found this app to be very useful during a recent holiday to North America. It would update itself with any change of flight departures while travelling.Well recommended.
2014,4,"Not sure how or why but suddenly information about hotels is written in a language I don't understand and I can't figure out how to change this. Up until now, brilliant app!"
2014,4,Gives you multiple choices for the best deal. The price alerts have saved me money!
2014,5,Best travel app I use. Easy to enter information. Simple to add and update. Very professional.
2014,5,"Love this app, with me traveling more, it's fantastic to have a one stop shop for cheapest flights and hotels! Thanks Kayak!"
2014,5,EXCELLENT! Site  .  As a former airline reservationist This is the site best site I have ever used!  Simple to use - NOT COMPLICATED.  THE BEST  TO SHOW NONSTOPS FOR ALL AIR CARRIERS
2014,4,"It works very good when monitoring flight tickets prices.the notification alert didn't work,otherwise work great ✈⛵"
2014,5,Very quick and easy. I like it a lot. I would recommend it.
2014,1,A 4 and half hour flight has no need to take 36 hours.  This needs to change about airlines and those who sell these seats. It's all a crock of BS!!!!
2014,4,"The app is very good but if I had never downloaded it and judged it by the TV Ads for it, I would not be impressed. For God's sake, GET A NEW AD AGENCY!!!"
2014,3,This new interface with that ridiculous spinning airplane as a loading marker. Please bring back the old interface or something resembling it. Please.
2014,5,Saved me lots of money because of ease of use.  WaS able to check flights daily.  Wish the airfare alert would notify me without opening the app
2014,5,All my travel tools in one place. Great for international travel with currency. Overall very happy with this app.
2014,5,Awesome. Gives you all you need to fly cheaper and on schedule.  Lots of flight choices too. Thanks Kayak.
2014,5,I never have a technical problem with this app. Nice to go to one place on my phone and still get the lowest fares without tons of research
2014,5,Works well. I wish it didn't have a default city for hotel though. It should stay on the last city.
2014,5,Great app. Nice filtering options. Cheap flights and car rentals.
2014,1,"Please let me actually access your app. When I can, it's great. Forced feedback,  not so much"
2014,5,I love how easy it is to use this app. Although it lacks some of the filter features of the website it gets the job done and quickly.
2014,4,"Is a great app me and my wife used it on our trip to California and back home to Arkansas and the information,time,money saved,and events we found were great"
2014,5,I love that I can monitor multiple flight options and get alerts when fares drop. Makes trip planning a breeze.
2014,5,"It is simple to use, allows multiple variables, and I've booked some fantastic deals. A+ in my books."
2014,3,What's the point when there's so much more options on my website browser... How about discounts etc.?
2014,3,"If you leave the site,  you have to start your search over.  It does not save specifics such as filters, start rating and price."
2014,5,Used kayak alerts to monitor Kong Kong flight prices for my dates - after a week an airline offer arrived and saved £700! Now I'm waiting for a half term offer to Europe.
2014,2,"Tried to book a hotel in Florida Keyes.  Not too many listed rates.  Too many ""call resort"" listing s"
2014,5,"I've always been a fan of kayak, on my blackberry it worked well, and on my photon it was great!!!!! Now on my S4 it's even better. Very convenient for one who travels a bunch such as myself. Highly recommended... 😄😊"
2014,5,"Works great on my Note 3, I travel a lot and find this helpful for quick availability of flights."
2014,2,Prices dont match and gives errors on the united airlines page. Delta works fine.
2014,5,Best rates: even shows rates from all other search agents and let's you book from there as well! Also has a great trip planner.
2014,4,Very useful app for travel. It shows prices incl. of taxes and other fees so it's easier to prepare expenses.
2014,4,Needs a lot of information but works well. Will keep using until a problem happens
2014,5,"Whenever I need to find the best deals, I used this app. It definitely deserves the 5 stars"
2014,5,I use this for most of my travel and it always works great. Passes information through to airlines perfectly.
2014,4,"Good hotel prices. But it's expensive plane tickets, I do love how you have the check list and everything though"
2014,5,Top five favorite apps! Easy to use and allows you to search various parameters with a few easy swipes.  Highly recommended!!
2014,5,This is best app in this store I used this app every day.. Thank you so much for development this
2014,4,Like the app a lot besides for the fact that you can no longer see a live feed of the plane like on the old version (and current ios version)
2014,5,"Greatest part is the trips... keeps you up to date on flights and hotels and car rentals... I use it on every trip,  every time."
2014,5,I love everything about this app. It's very helpful. I like it better than most of the other ones I use. I use this one the most for flights
2014,5,"Recently switched from another app for tracking trips. Kayak is, in my opinion, far superior. I am absolutely loving it!"
2014,5,Best for multi-city flight booking. Probably the only one that works!
2014,5,I was looking on the TV and saw a commercial of this and I tried it out. Kayak is so simple and awesome and gives you all the best possibilities! Love it! ☆☆☆☆☆
2014,2,The Ap no longer recognises airline short codes ie Thomas Cook (TCX) Thompson (TOM) etc. It used to so what has happened to this Ap !!!
2014,5,"Very helpful, a go-to even when I intend to book on a specific airline since many of their apps (delta for instance) don't allow multi-segment searches."
2014,1,Why does it need access to all my photos and media to book hotels. Sounds suspicious to me
2014,5,Love the user interface.  Its the reason I've used kayak for the past 4 years or so
2014,5,Gets it done in a simple quick way. Unbeatable prices. The best site specially for airfare.
2014,5,I always check this app first when traveling for business or pleasure. Very easy to navigate and good interface.
2014,5,No guess the price games or anything like that. Perfect travel app + I love things spelled the same fwd & bkwrd Haaaha!
2014,5,I wonder what the min number of words is? App is great. Stay awesome kayak!
2014,5,"I use Kayak for all my travel planning, in U.S. and overseas. It's the best and my only complaint is Southwest Airlines doesn't participate."
2014,5,Kayak has helped me travel and saved me a lot of money. It's easy to use. Def recommend this app👍
2014,5,Works well. Easy-to-use. Still working well.
2014,5,I use it every time I travel. Finds the lowest price and runs well. Top drawer.first rate.
2014,4,Very cool.  But I don't like the new interface.
2014,5,Good deals. Better prices. Easy to use.
2014,5,"It's too bad Kayak doesn't give you bonuses like Orbitz, but Kayak is one of the cheapest most fluid sites so..."
2014,4,Interface needs a little update but the app itself is quite useful.
2014,5,I always find the best deals on this app compared to any other flight site. It is helpful if you are a frequent flyer looking for the best deal!
2014,5,I really live booking my flight from here. It is an excellent app and I will always recommend it to anyone out there...very easy to use.
2014,3,This is a great app but if it would let users search for cheapest flight not only fixed days or +-2 days it would be a top app.

2014,5,Hotels and more
2014,5,
2014,1,"I've been using this app regularly to keep an eye on flights for my upcoming trip. With this new update, Kayak keeps crashing and reloading, particularly when I'm trying to filter the search results. And when I click ""include nearby aitports"", it doesn't. The app ONLY shows me the airport I select. I can't look at the flights I want anymore! Please fix!"
2014,1,"Do not use kayak or Travelocity they are the same company. And if you cancel you're trip they will not repay you. They will say they have no record of you're call. Better to just pay the extra through they hotel, motel. These people don't care about you just their pocket book. I've already turned them into the BBB.  I even sent them a recording of the call of me canceling the reservations and they still say they have no record of the call."
2014,5,This app worthy 4.5 stars a small bug needs attention with selecting the dates month to month.... But I could get it to work...with some extra tapping.   A plus or minus 7 days either side of travel would be good for the traveler same goes for Web version.   So we can choose the better deals with out having to change the dates all the time.... It would be good if you can ban/or filter airlines from your searching and its a toggle off instead of deselecting airlines you don't want in your search....
2014,5,One of the best apps. I have on my phone. Prices are not spot on but are close enough that it gives you a good idea of what you're going to pay. Been using it for 5 or more years now. Love it!
2014,1,Did a search for rental cars using the same info and filters on my laptop and then my phone (S5). $33/day for an intermediate car on the laptop from Dollar...$67/day on the phn from Dollar. Uninstalled.
2014,5,Best look and search design.  Able to see multiple airports and times at once.  Great tool!  Plus all boarding info with Trip Planner.  Fantastic travel tool.
2014,5,As a frequent traveller I use Kayak to log all my bookings and keep them in a single place. Its integration with Calendar makes it extremely useful. Beat travel app out here.
2014,3,"Ok if you want your price displayed in tl, whatever currency that is. Not very user friendly trying to change it to sterling"
2014,4,Good app overall. Would like it to push airfare alerts without having to open the app. It makes me not have to remember to check!
2014,2,"It doesn't remember your last search, instead automatically searching for flights to San Francisco every single time I open the app.. Not very useful..."
2014,5,I love the functionality of this app. You can even choose your desired layover airport. The only downside is I haven't figured out how to set a round trip flight for the same day yet.
2014,5,Thank you for Kayak team for supporting htc one devices with this amazing app. Only one thing should be taken into consideration for flight tracker which always delays the flight data
2014,5,I use it to book hotels all the time. Very convenient and good deals. Must have app for frequent travelers.
2014,5,Had this app for over a year. Though the I PAD app has a different tab that shows you the lowest priced flights across the world; this makes traveling in college cheap and hassle free.
2014,5,"Booked our entire last vacation using this Application. Flights, hotels, and a vehicle rental. Flawless, smooth, and easy to use. Great job!"
2014,5,Good app. Makes it very easy to find and compare car rental and hotel fees. I will definitely keep using this app.....
2014,5,Love it. Very useful. Would like to receive the price notifications without enter the app.
2014,3,It's great and easy to use but I've found some of the quotes aren't  accurate and I have yet to find a single nonstop flight
2014,1,It's so difficult to use this app now especially when looking for a round trip flight. .
2014,4,Was able to load 4 possible travel plans and set up alerts for them so I can decide which one is best.
2014,4,"Great response time. I planned a trip with connecting flights, hotel, events etc. all went great ."
2014,2,Meh. Once kayak got bought by priceline prices went back to normal.
2014,5,They had information faster than the gate agent!  Must have for frequent travelers.
2014,5,"Very helpful in every way possible, from cars to flights to hotels to notifying me when prices changed. Loved it."
2014,5,I like to new graphics.   App appears to work even faster than before.
2014,4,Love this app but I want to be able to book a package and I don't believe it gives this option.
2014,5,Forward all your trip booking receipts to Kayak for a handy summary itinerary. Also very good flight search functionality
2014,5,A must have for cheap ticket hunters like me. You rock KAYAK!
2014,5,This app has proven itself.  It consistently finds the cheapest price!!
2014,5,Loved the app. Easy to use. Useful
2014,4,Good tool to get an average fare price on major airlines
2014,5,i have been using it for 3 yeats now... simply kayak iz your best travel agency
2014,4,It has good reviews for the most part on lodging.
2014,5,Very easy to use and the tickets are much cheaper than others!
2014,3,The website does not work as well as on a computer.
2014,5,"I have used Kayak for years and its convenient, reliable and user friendly."
2014,5,Great app. Always find cheap flights!
2014,5,Good app! Gets the job done wonderfully.

2014,4,"Very good for casual use. I'd love to see more options added into the app for business travelers. Would love the ability to scan receipts. Have the hotel email receipts and merge it with my corresponding itinerary. Map integration (nearest Starbucks, train station..). I'm currently using three different apps to complete the above. Would like to do it all within one app."
2014,1,This app refuses to search for a vehicle on the dates and time I need... I made a 3 AM pick up reservation and it made it a 3 PM pick up time. I called Thrifty to try and correct the problem and now they want to charge me 3 times the rate I got the first time! I wish Travelocity still had the car rental service!
2014,5,More so than other travel apps that limit available flights to display only those 1.5 hours out. Much more convenient when you're that person standing in the middle of the departure airport trying to book a flight. Simple and flexible searching for all travel options.
2014,4,I LOVE this app for travel. Would give it 5 stars except it doesn't give you the option for flexible dates like you can do on the webpage version. Everything else is awesome especially filter feature.
2014,5,"I like the layout of the app but when i punched in nellysford, va.  Each place says to Call the hotel.  This isnt why i got the app to call the hotel. I am looking for the best deals.  If they dont want their prices listed then they should not be included in this app"
2014,4,Loved the app for years.  But the flight search option didn't work for 6 months.  Had to switch to Expedia.  Glad to see the search issue has been fixed.
2014,3,"Dear developers, after latest updates the application is not good as before. The currency is not changed and always give in USD. For the trip I don't get all available options."
2014,5,Always kayak has been leader in travel booking website or mobile appp ui/ux. Others follow kayak. Cons : performance of search needs lots of improvements
2014,5,Have had this app for many years. Its great for pricing flights while on the go! They also have added new convenient features.
2014,2,The currency keeps showing £ even after I have changed to $ multiple times in the preferences. App has little use if I can compare prices in my local currency.
2014,5,This feature saved me a lot of money.  Without it I would have missed an significant airline price drop that only lasted a few hours.
2014,3,This app sucks!   Doesn't give you the option to book flight and hotel together like you can on websites!
2014,1,The problem with the Kayak is that after you purchase your airline tickets you have to deal with Vayama customer service and every time I do it's very unpleasant experience and for this reason I will NEVER purchase anything from Kayak again but I will always used them when searching for airline tickets
2014,5,Excellent app for busy people. No need to stay long browsing for cheap tickets. Just use this app to project the fares and choose your travel date.
2014,5,"Handy tool I use for a flight, rental car or hotel. The convenience will spoil you."
2014,5,I use Kayak all the time and don't know how I managed without it. Keep all my travel arrangements in one place. Love it!
2014,5,"Kayak has a massive list of hotels, flights, vehicle rentals, and even a trip planner to make sure you don't forget anything along the way! I recommend it thoroughly!"
2014,5,A very handy app for trip planning and update. Works well for me; no complains
2014,5,U can book confident for Kayak always have the cheapest prices....you can easily compare with other websites before booking (it gives u the option if u want to compare).
2014,3,Flight Tracker is difficult to use on my phone.   I have to use landscape view to enter the flight info.
2014,4,Helpful for when you're on the go and have limited time to research and book a flight. Don't know why in flight tracker doesn't work though.
2014,5,Got a great deal leaving  Logan at a reasonable hour for a very reasonable price. Thanks Kayak
2014,5,I love every aspect of this app. It is a travel agency on my phone.
2014,4,Use it all the time. I will add a 5th star when Kayak stops crashing the 1st time you launch it will no Internet.
2014,5,"Kayak saves a lot of time searching for cars, flights, and hotels. The only thing missing would be the ability to look for cruises."
2014,3,So helpful when travelling.  It would help if I could calculate insurance too.
2014,2,Why this application don't ask for kids age? Price is better if tickets are for kids.
2014,4,I like the filters the map is good but would like to see the hotel before clicking on the price.
2014,2,It used to work great couple of years ago. Now very unstable
2014,5,Tried other apps but this makes life much easier. plus I love those little spinning loading images
2014,5,Works for me every time. Always the lowest price for flights.
2014,5,It is Great app to use. It is easy to navigate and I found the perfect flight I was looking for.
2014,5,"Very easy to use, love how I can get alerts on specific dates of travel."
2014,4,Does what it says. Seems to work smoothly so far.
2014,4,Useful app. With a wide array of info at hand.
2014,5,very good app 100 pct ture on what u pay for ur tickets love this app
2014,5,Love it. Keeps up with constant rate changes and saves time from putting in same info over and over.
2014,5,Excellent worth 5 star for this app to find the best flight rates
2014,5,App does what it is supposed to do. Actually purchased multidestination ticket at a ridiculous process.
2014,5,"Can fin better deals using this app, very helpful."
2014,5,I used kayak for all my trip since 3 years ago
2014,3,ننتظر التحديثات  We will waiting updates

2014,5,Yep
2014,5,Bon Bagay
2014,1,"This app used to be wonderful. Now however, it has too many glitches and won't let me book my flight. I've had to enter my cc info several times with no success. Which makes anyone a Lil iffy. It put a hold on all my money for doing so making it impossible for me to book my flight over the phone.  Honestly it's not worth the headache!"
2014,3,"I used the Kayak app in Hollywood. Each day I'd use the app to find a room. Here are some issues: 1. No pan or zoom on map. 2. search by location seems impossible. ""Near Me"" would be nice 3. The min-max price slider... Highest price is billion per night, try sliding  down to something sane not poss. 4. Doesnt ""remember"" dates you picked if you go to google maps so you can actually see location, and come back to app. How about ""today"" default or button... Thanks"
2014,4,"Its a pretty good app, however, I have yet to see where you can add children to your hotel stay. You can add more ""people"" but then the hotel adds them as adults which can result in extra fees in some hotels when its actual just your children staying with you. I wish they would add this option. But other than that they've covered all of the basic concepts and I enjoy using it."
2014,1,The new version is crap. No longer able to filter flight results with less than 24 hour duration.  Why the F would I want a 15 hour layover!?  Also put in a price alert for month of Oct.  Gave me a result for a trip lasting Oct-May.  Real helpful.
2014,3,"The price alert feature used to work well but no longer does. No longer notifies me of price alerts,  despite having it set up to do so. Also prices are often wrong;  I can often find cheaper fares gping directly to the airline's website."
2014,5,Ability to convert email travel confirmations into events and calendar entries is brilliant. Saves so much time.  Flight status updates also excellent.  Some good features in the app too like the Taxi View for example. Definitely worth having. It's getting quicker at converting the confirmations too. Great app.
2014,1,As bad as priceline is. This ap is twice the price. Sure there is no booking fee. Because they charge u for use by purchasing the ticket inside the fare. I've compared this ap several times. Always twice the price or more. Example just today I searched a flight. On priceline roundtrip 325 usd.. on this ap . Same flight. $500 per person... WTF. I just wanted to post this before I uninstall this worthless app
2014,1,"This application is one of the largest existing Internet frauds. Actually, this is an amalgam of absolute rubbish. The final prices NEVER match with the combined and accepted by the customer. These robbers camouflaged in lambs, take advantage of the moments of excitement in the last minute of the check in to require other values  that were not what had been agreed. Another serious aspect: the customers never have guaranteed the seats. When arriving at the airport, passengers have almost always surprises."
2014,5,Makes it so easy to check the fares on multiple airlines at one time. Lots of other useful features as well. It's a very good app!  (Although I'm not sure that spinning airplane is the smartest icon to use)
2014,2,"Has some useful things but don't rely on flight tracking. It has a problem with flight delays. WN 204 delayed twice. Now 40 min after finding out through others sources, this app stll shows on time. Second delay received but nothing fm this app. 40min delay now but same result. It's 11:40am. My flight was scheduled to leave at 11:25am. This app still shows it on time. Flightview more accurate."
2014,3,"At 7/21/2014  this app showed flight AS460 landed at 13:50 but the current time was13:40 and FlightView Tracker showed the flight was still at 33,000 feet and later landed at 14:00 hours. Not as accurate as I would have expected Kayak to be. Other kayak options are still untested"
2014,4,"The app is working fine on my tablet and easy to use. The only issues I face is that checking price from an Alert never works, the plane icon keeps rotating for ever and no results are displayed at all. The 2ndvissue is that if you left the app running and the screen went out or you go to home, then rotated the tablet up-side-down, then when you invoke the app again, it crashes."
2014,3,"Too many updates in quiet short periods became really annoying especially with samsung devices cuz it doesn't replace the new version with the old one but it creates an entire new apk. & folder which causes killing the memory n the ram, If nothing changed iam deleting the app so plz stop updates!"
2014,2,I've used this app exclusively for the last 2 years and liked everything about it. I tryed tonight and its completely changed. I can no longer change the currency and the features are no longer usable. I'm very disappointed. Sorry to uninstall.  Samsung Note 8
2014,5,"Kayak search all of the deals from all airlines and agencies and gives you the best price. I usually compare to others web-based-agencies like Priceline, Orbitz, Hotwire... as well but Kayak prices are usually equal or lesser. If the price is from an airlines, Kayak sends you directly to their website so you can buy it directly without paying extra fees like Orbitz, even though it's only a few bucks fee."
2014,3,"Loved the app before the recent update. It's now very difficult to use. I have to rotate my screen back and forth to use all of the functions. Also, I can't figure out how to switch between multiple flights."
2014,1,"Booked 2 months in advance for Seattle. We arrived that morning to find out they moved us to a more expensive hotel on the other side of the city, so we had to rent a car and pay for parking. The trip ended up costing us $500.00 more and they won't reimburse us anything. They say it's a past reservation. DO NOT use Kayak!!!"
2014,3,Gets stuck on Delta Airlines initializing screen. Getting a Java scripting error. Now I have to search for a flight directly through the Delta Airlines site. - Samsung Galaxy S4
2014,3,"The desktop site is perfect for searching anything you want. However, on the android mobile app, I have to do the search multiple time and it takes forever to load results for flights. I would appreciate some improvements there!"
2014,1,Update messed it up. You can't enter round trip dates on a Galaxy Pocket - calendar takes up whole screen.  Also screen does not autorotate anymore.
2014,4,"I've used this for years and it's wonderful, but I think the new owners have gotten dangerously careless about what they list. Twice this year I've been badly burned by something that wasn't quite what it seemed. One was listed under hotels but was an AirBnB style apartment listing; they sent no info on how to get in! When I arrived in the rain I was screwed, and the listing agency was no help. Another was a severely restricted airfare that I didn't realize I was getting. Both of them never used to happen."
2014,4,I was able to compare multiple hotel rates with a single search. I would definitely use this again for my next trip. I saved hotels I liked and then booked from those after reading reviews and ratings. All confirmations were kept in a single space negating the need for multiple websites.
2014,4,"The deals pulled up are compared between institutions, and you get to choose which venue you want to use based on value. I kinda wish the maps were a tad more interactive/zoomable, but overall it's easy to use and easy to navigate."
2014,4,"Please allow searching for airfares to destination based on lowest price available on a range of time rather than only the range of dates specified by the user.  Sometimes my travel date is very flexible, meaning in weeks rather than just days, so please allow searching for the lowest price over a greater range of days."
2014,2,"I used to love this app, but there is no history list on the new version. This makes checking prices over time much more difficult. Hopefully they will rethink this and the search history will return."
2014,1,"Cust service hangs up on you when they don't understand. Verification process sux. Flight insurance bills and fights don't. The bank says, no problem, yet process cancels."
2014,4,Nice UI but need more friendly features for do flights.  It does not remember dates I entered before. Set price alert for multiple date.
2014,1,New version of app horrible.  Can't see locations off the main search  page for dealers.  Just goes to show u should never update an app u like
2014,4,Great resource for booking holidays. I've used this to find the best flight deals for my last few trips. Couldn't be without it. Very easy to use UI.
2014,1,Works great finding flights but it will not let me book my desired flight. Tried on both S4 and tablet just to see. No joy.
2014,4,i was surprised when it notified me of gate change before arrival to my transit airport. Make sure you have internet and check the app. regularly for flights status updates. You will be surprised by its usefulness  and accuracy.
2014,1,"Well organized,  but doesn't allow one way booking. Good interface , easy to use, cars, flight, hotel, everything I need save the lack of one way flights. :("
2014,4,"Latest update keeps crashing and voiding out search entry. Crashing when trying to scroll. Can't use anymore. 06.14.14 - working well now, not crashing anymore, like it!"
2014,5,"Whenever I needed it the app showed me the way, with accurate information, statistics, and even in-flight tracking this app truly has all the features I need and want when I'm traveling. I wouldn't recommend this app enough, honestly."
2014,5,I use this app even when im just bored to look at affordable optiobs for vacations. Booked a trip to nyc and enjoyed every minute of it. Thank you kayak! Thumbs up
2014,1,Why bother with this app when it has such a poor mapping aspect. No control of the map. I need to go to another map app to get any info. Total waste of time!
2014,3,It would be nice is they can add cruises to kayak also.  Planning a trip to Alaska and going to cruise for a week.  Trying to figure out the best prices for flying and cruising.
2014,2,"I love KAYAK & used to use older version regularly. In newer release, filters don't work. Barely usable"
2014,5,I travel a lot and I am constantly using this app to find and compare fares. I used it recently to rent a car literally at the airport. It's very convenient.  I also track fares using the tracker. My only complaint is that I'd like to be able to easily see the month grid or flexible dates using the app. All in all.. it's my favorite fare finder.
2014,5,"Love all the options, etc for fares, cars, & accommodations.   The comments are extremely helpful - a negative to someone else may not be for me.  Very helpful."
2014,5,I love this app! I have used it many times to help with my travel plans. It is like my own personal travel assistant! Very user friendly 😀
2014,5,Easy to use and a quick way to see & compare options.  Additional features make it very easy to track and prepare for all kinds of travel. Great app!
2014,4,"This app, has the option for multi-city flight booking which is lacking in expedia and flight scanner. Also easy interface and great options make this app friendly to use."
2014,2,"Always errors out on track a flight.  Used to be a super easy to use and whether u book your flight with them or not they will still track your flights, gate changes etc, but not anymore"
2014,1,Ive been trying to book a flight for 2 days now and everytime the price of fare goes up by the time I get to booking. As well the app froze several times when I hit the purchase.
2014,5,Convenient and easy. I love being able to search for a getaway at any moment. Kayak's alert feature rocks!
2014,1,"unable to book online hotel at price indicated.  wasting time finding hotel,  then link to book,  the price goes up,  trying to book through you to Expedia, at the end of the form,  all my personal info  including credit card info is given and yet they are unable to confirm my booking."
2014,4,"I book a ticket every other month and Kayak is one of my ""go to"" applications; there is an issue with Delta booking, unfortunately, compatibility issue once you are almost at check out, but other than that. Great application."
2014,5,Actually found flights that Expedia and Orbitz did not (and I've been an Expedia fan for years).  Very pleased so far with Kayak.  I don't even check the other apps now when looking for flights.
2014,4,They're missing an option to check for nearby airports and to check for availability 3+/- days. These are available online.
2014,5,Hands down best app for travel ... keeps all my travel itinerary & details in 1 place and links back to the original confirmation.   Flight tracking is easily accessible as well.  Can't recommend Kayak enough!
2014,5,Great savings on hotels. When we travel I can look ahead or even right then to find hotels near where we are going to be. I love not having to jump from site to site to find the best prices. It's all right here
2014,5,Great app for finding super deals under Buzz. Got tickets for LAX to Easter Island for $560 RT!  Incredible!!
2014,5,"I OFTEN use this simple yet reliable app to scan for flights, set alerts, and review saved itineraries.  Wonderful tool"
2014,5,I really dig the UI and how efficient their servers are when processing my flight requests. I already used this app a couple times for my important flight trips.
2014,5,We can always find a great deal at the spare of the moment. Love this app. Try it!
2014,4,Works fairly well. Only complaint is that application doesn't save dates and # of people from prior search
2014,5,Kayak continues to evolve into the premier travel resource.  Easy to navigate.  And always up to date.  Love the My Trips section.  Southwest access would be a big plus.
2014,5,I've used Kayak online for years and the app had less features when it first came out but now it's awesome and I consider it an invaluable tool
2014,4,Great for finding lowest prices for flughts and hotels easy in your phone.  A little frustrating when the app defaults the wrong airport or currency.
2014,4,I set up the daily fare alert and it never alerts me until I manually go inside the app then it comes up. If you don't mind doing that then the app is good
2014,2,Compare with a desktop version of this is very poor and also somehow it always makes me fly into San Francisco by default. It lacks most of the fetures of found on the desktop .
2014,4,I love it! It really helps for those first time oversea travelers for hotels and flights! Totally recommend it to anyone! There are price inaccuracies on some flights but only some!
2014,5,"Easy to do on - demand query and with the alerts always working for us, I can check my e - mails to see bargains and more importantly trends. So for our annual or occasional trips we have objective information to add to the wag of when is the best time to purchase your travel."
2014,3,App is missing some nice features the website offers. Cruises? Packages? Vacation fares by month.
2014,2,The app gives the option to choose how many passengers but dont add the total cost of the tickets. Fix that detail.
2014,5,"Really nice, sharp interface and very quick. This should be the only app you need for all your travels."
2014,3,Slow and not always shows same as airline options/flights. Good generally though but some
2014,5,Great app. I use it to plan flight alway. Except the feature My Location is not working.
2014,2,Only shows delta and American airlines fights. Did same search with same details on price line app showed way more flights and cheaper.
2014,4,"Great to check flights, prices, options as well as manage alerts of your purchased trips (even the ones you did not book through Kayak)."
2014,5,Really helps. Saved me hundreds when compared to booking on a specific airlines site. Works in Canada too.
2014,5,"Install = Effortless, Speed of Response = Excellent, Return On Investment (time) = Priceless. Well done. // Updated July 9th, 2014. Hands-down winner!"
2014,5,I loved this app! There are good options like great prices of the hotels!! Very good..
2014,5,"Very useful and helpful when comparing different rates for hotels, flights, and car rentals.  They even have a fare alert you can add to tell you the changes in price for flights."
2014,4,Do wish they realized Charlotte Airport (CLT) and Columbia South Carolina Airport (CAE) are only 70 miles apart and should be considered a local airports.
2014,5,They definitely find you the lowest prices. Used them all the time. I'm a frequent flyer. Thank you Kayak. You rock!!!!!!!!!
2014,5,Since you can have it on your phone or login from any computer you never have to lose any information regarding your itinerary. Great app.
2014,2,This app always shuts down when I go to click a hotel I want to view. It also says one too left when I try to view it no rooms available.
2014,5,"I love this app! So quick and it shows me when the cheapest tickets will be around, booked my trip to New York using Kayak one of my favorite apps!"
2014,4,"Sometimes pulls up sold out or non existent flights, not the app's fault, but kayak's, wish they would fix their system, good app though."
2014,1,Used to love it. App no longer allows me to filter.  Now useless. I'll have to use a differnt app.
2014,5,"Love this app! It's so quick, easy, and convenient to look up flights, cars, and hotels for any trip you are taking. Overall, awesome!"
2014,4,Just great. Allows great planning and price checks with timely remainders. Find it simply fantastic help on travel
2014,4,"Kayak is a great app for multiple services,  easy and convenient too. Kayak is the best app I've come across for flight, hotel bookings and even more convenient."
2014,3,The site is harder to use. The filters are not working for me. Was easier to use in the past.
2014,4,Solid app thus far. Hoping it doesn't disappoint. Makes searching for destinations easier!
2014,5,I wish I could just make the item The Bee Movie on just a little but they will then send pics its like a best movie but other than that it's a pretty good travel pic you can always improve in there but we'll see new innovations coming home soon so I'll be looking forward to that
2014,4,Great app but current version not correctly displaying on Samsung galaxy s3
2014,1,it takes me 2 day to get the confirmation and the price change its 150$ more than the ticket i've choosen 2 days ago . the payment also sucks busy and take to long
2014,5,Really happy to find this in the Google Play Store when I switched from iPhone to my Samsung Galaxy Mega! !
2014,5,"Quick and easy to use.  Great for looking at deals, especially lat minute deals"
2014,5,"Great app and give you realistic prices, far better than sky scanner because the price shown is the price you pay unlike others, I use it every time I need a price on a particular flight, it never lets me down."
2014,4,Works great.   Lots of good features for a mobile app
2014,5,I love this app and I am a frequent user of this app. Great app for frequent traveller like me.
2014,5,Reviews nearly all airlines for flight pricing.  Hotel deals are the best out there.
2014,5,I love having this app. I was able to plan a weekend out of town from home. Great prices!
2014,5,Great deals. Easy interface. Saves time.
2014,5,Very best app to use for travel/trips. It has it all. I highly recommend this app.
2014,3,"I tried ""Hotels"" part and found that it uses GPS and internet, so one cannot plan ahead or without internet access"
2014,5,"I love this application. I use it all the time to book my flights and hotels. While I was abroad, this was a real life saver."
2014,5,This app does wonders for me. Saved me almost half of what I would've spent if I were to go online and buy from the airline directly!
2014,1,"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE! TRY TO PLUG IN THE DATES, AND IT WON'T GO. SO UNINSTALLING!"
2014,3,"I wish that the app, like the website,  had package options to choose from (flight +hotel for good prices)"
2014,5,Awesome app really helpful. Reminder works great.
2014,5,Just saved a ton of money on my upcoming vacation thru kayak! Ill never use anything else to plan my family's vacations again!!
2014,5,Amazing! Older version remember your old searches and sync with your web browser searches
2014,1,"Login does not work properly, feedback window not stable with tablet, experience much worse than on pc, really bad experience."
2014,1,What's the point. Doesn't even offer the multiple day search grid for flights.
2014,3,"The airport information tool is useless: after selecting specific categories to look for, establishments in all categories are still listed."
2014,5,Other sites availability also gives you the option to check what type of rooms each site may or may not offer ....which I've always enjoyed
2014,5,"Ive used it twice using my phone , and it works great."
2014,5,Makes life much simpler.  Thank you💋
2014,3,Haven't really used it. But gives good info on traveling.
2014,5,"Extremely helpful for spur of the moment travelling.  Be prepared for the hotel to ask you to cough up an additional ""resort fee"" once you arrive."
2014,5,Incredibly quick. Very functional. Exceeds expectations for any app.
2014,5,Use this app all the time. Works great.
2014,3,This is good but am not really satisfied with the service. Just gave 3stars for more improvement.
2014,3,"The app hung up when I clicked the ? On the form.  Also, I could not save."
2014,4,I like this app a lot. I've never had any technical problems with it on my Samsung S3.
2014,4,Good clean simple app that consistently has the best prices for travel. Must have
2014,4,Tried many other travel apps in comparing prices. So far this had shown me the best prices.
2014,4,Great app - fix search for +-X days on trip will get you 5 stars
2014,4,Pretty much all the pricing for travel expenses all in one app. Great app.
2014,4,Really good and reliable app for affordable flights! Must use
2014,4,Genuine pricing for booking.. Does thorough search to get you the best price
2014,5,Has all the bells and whistles for avid and novice travelers including extras like money exchange calculations. It's great.
2014,5,Kayak is a number one in air ticket booking app. i tried many apps in the same category but no app better than Kayak.
2014,2,The offers through the website are a lot better than the ones the app shows you.
2014,5,It's the best app for booking almost all aspects of travel. The travel alerts are a great extra.
2014,4,Great easy to use app. Currency conversion is limited and not all through the app.
2014,5,I always got a better deal!!!! Cheapest fares
2014,5,I absolutely love this app when I need to compare hotel room prices.. I was booked a trip using this app and it was so helpful
2014,3,Has some functionality ussues compared to its website ...
2014,5,Kayak is a great solution for finding flights that suits your needs. Great job all around.
2014,3,A must for traveling people but MyTrips won't add sometimes your info
2014,3,Full site let's you search for flight and hotel packages. The app doesn't
2014,4,If the screen rotated when viewing results then it would be five stars
2014,4,Excellent software but still need improvement related to the passengers info
2014,1,Asked correctly about my country - but will only work with my phones gps on - why?
2014,4,"Flights, easy, wish I could sort by latest flight and adjust for long layovers for cheaper rates"
2014,3,Won't search for flights in airplane mode even if WiFi is connected
2014,4,Good application but need to add more currencies such as Omani Rials
2014,4,Good but sometime prices doesn't match with the ones shown on the computer.
2014,5,"It is very easy to use this application. I recommending to find whatever you want flights, cars, etc."
2014,5,"Great flights & rates, especially last minute. Very convenient."
2014,5,All in one travel app. Great when you are on the go!
2014,5,This is the best app and site ever. Especially since they are truthful when another site is cheaper than they are
2014,4,Useful way to find information for further research and estimates of costs.
2014,5,I found the absolute best price on Kayak! Love using it.
2014,5,"Must echo George Miller.  This is a good app, but was better when it saved searches."
2014,3,"They included SW Airlines, Jetblue and Virgin I'd exclusively use this app for travel."
2014,5,Love kayak.  Easy to use and you get lots of useful  information.
2014,5,Handy and easy to use. Would like the prediction of price increase and decrease the site has with that 5+
2014,5,We travel all the time with my daughter's softball team and this app works flawless I use it every other weekend
2014,5,"Very easy to use and gives you up to date pricing, I've been using it for about 5 Years."
2014,5,I only go here!  Proven and faithful provider of lowest fares.
2014,4,I just wish the last search would be retained to speed up the process of daily checks
2014,4,Saves time but all sites seems to have the same price
2014,4,User this app frequently as it has a majority of the airlines available at your fingertips
2014,5,Well thought through app. Great choice and decent prices
2014,5,Awesome app! Always use it when im planning to travel somewhere.
2014,5,"Handy, so easy to use, and very helpful whenever you need to travel. Tnx"
2014,5,I've used this site and app for years... Great stuff 😊
2014,5,More organized than the website. One screen instead of multiple tabs.
2014,5,"I really like ""my trips"", it's great having all the information about your journey together in one place"
2014,5,"This app is amazing. Simple, easy to use, and quick!"
2014,5,Please Add Kenya in the country selection and Currency... Otherwise All okela...
2014,5,It was very helpful when I traveled!!!! Very easy to use. I will recommend this to my friends. Awesome!!!!!!!!!
2014,4,"Used it from florida to ontario, works great!"
2014,5,Love the review aspect for which ever hotel you would like to stay. So you can pick the right one at the right price
2014,5,"Straight forward, intuitive design makes finding travel info fast and easy."
2014,4,It should also show results of low cost airlines
2014,5,"Smooth page transitions, easy to use and navigate, best app downloaded in a while!!!"
2014,5,"I especially like the ""MY TRIPS"" feature and the ability to search multiple travel sites with one click."
2014,5,I am amazed how this app combined different airline itineraries into a single trip. Great work and highly recommended app.
2014,5,I use this on my laptop frequently and I've enjoyed having it at my fingertips wherever I am.
2014,5,"The app is great, easy to use and very helpful for traveling."
2014,5,Very easy to use. Probably better than the full site.
2014,4,"Yes, it works almost as good as the website."
2014,5,I had to make last mins trips an it found cheap an really great rooms i use it all the time to plan my trips
2014,5,Has become an essential tool for keeping my travel details in order and automatically shared with all I need to share with.
2014,5,Saving money is easy on this app and with this app it is a lot easier to do the things I need to do to save money on airfare.
2014,4,It always conveniently gives me the cheapest flights.
2014,5,"I have used lots of travel apps, but I find Kayak to be the best."
2014,5,"Great help and unbeatable prices, my one and only app to book travel..."
2014,5,The best travel app available. The mytrip functionality is very useful
2014,5,"Super helpful, no bugs, just like the website without the ads"
2014,5,Works beautifully.  Great information.
2014,5,Love that kayak gives you the direct line to the hotels not the 800 numbers like other sites.
2014,5,"Great app, been using it for years, and love the simplicity."
2014,4,Download as many as u can and u can safe more $
2014,5,"Excellent! Search one and done, just like the slogan."

2014,5,Kayak rocks
2014,5,Exceeds expectations
2014,4,"This app does just about everything you could imagine.  I like the 'trip' feature, where you can enter the important details of your itinerary. It makes keeping track of and accessing all confirmation numbers and times a breeze, by displaying them in chronological order.    One star off because the flight tracker feature didn't update the gate I was flying out of.  If I have to check the departure screens anyway, it becomes useless. Unfortunate, because I really liked that feature, and it works 90%."
2014,3,"I was trying to book a flight on United on my phone. While the kayak search interface is great, when you go to actually book the flight all it does is show the website of the carrier in Kayaks app. However because it is in Kayaks app, you can't zoom auto fill, or any of the other useful functions built into web browsers. It made it impossible to book a flight.   I gave up and browsed to United in my web browser and booked the flight outside of kayak."
2014,2,"Comparing to the previous and the iOS version is disappointing. Less results all together, higher prices for found flights, seats available missing on many flights. I would think that the search engine is primary  over ""surch expeeriance"". Please don't sacrifice functionality for looks in the future and fix current asap. Thanks. Regards."
2014,1,"The previous version is perfect.  Meanwhile after update: - it no longer show the price of the flight, unless you click on a flight - thus it does not tell you the best date with cheapest price - meanwhile waiting it is no longer showing percentage instead a rotating airplane.  This is a very stupid update."
2014,1,"I just tried to search for a flight from Canada to France and got only 20 results, all of which were Air Canada. I tried to filter and discovered it was the *only* airline queried. And for some reason, the currency had reset to Turkish Lira??? Whatever changes were made in the latest update have made this app worthless."
2014,2,"On two separate occasions now I've tried to book flights on here and after selecting what flight I want, it tries linking me to the airline website and won't go through. When I check on an actual browser the flight is far more expensive. Outdated info is the only thing I can think of."
2014,5,"I have not found a better travel app after trying several. It's the only one I've tried that offers a multi-city flight search, and does it very well, on a mobile platform. You can make many different types of travel reservations, with a user interface that is very intuitive. It provides some interesting tools as well."
2014,3,"The flight filters now match the web and iOS versions. So far so good!  Edit: Found a bug: if adding/editing a Price Alert, the dates saved are off by one day earlier than originally input."
2014,1,"I decided to be daring and try the hotwire booking to get a 4 star hotel at a 2 star price. Daring because of the no refund go screw yourself policy. They booked me for the wrong night and then were ""nice"" enough to rebook me at the crappiest rathole ive ever been in. Oh and it was across town, with a 45min drive after ive arrived at my origional hotel, and only $22 cheaper. I will NEVER use hotwire again."
2014,3,"The app finds hotels just fine, but if you have price ranges between 80 and 3000, the price filtering does not allow you to filter to the lower ranges. I end up with 80 to 500, which is still to broad. It would be better to allow users to select their ranges."
2014,1,"Had been one of my favorites until I updated. ( Had even installed on several friends phones.) But since the update, it is awful! I can't even use it anymore. Wish I could Uninstall  update. Very sad to Uninstall."
2014,2,"I'm very flexible with my travel dates. I don't like the fact that it doesn't show you the dates on the results page. In the old version you can. I am not going to dig through each result, especially if it's a roundtrip flight. What were you guys thinking?!?"
2014,2,"The last time I used this app was a week before this posting,(5/14/14) when I was in a crunch and I had to book a round trip  flight to Pennsylvania ASAP. When I was in the final phases of purchasing the ticket, all of a sudden the app got unresponsive and not user friendly at all! In the end, I had to call Delta and book the flight with them!...and Delta charged me $53 more than what was being offered to me by KAYAK!"
2014,2,"It was a great app until the update came around. Please bring back the old search engine. It would allow you to see airports close to the location you choose. Now it just gives you an ugly no flights screen. I LOVED this app, please bring it back."
2014,3,"I don't like the spinning plane, but I agree with most that the prior interface was more diverse.  Should include the ability to search packages/vacation deals.  Also, travel tips to buy or wait for flights."
2014,4,"Could use a few more detailed options for searches, such as indoor/outdoor pool as opposed to just searching for a pool, but fairly quick, easily navigated, and smoothly transitions between the various other sites it checks. Overall pleased with the app."
2014,1,"I did a multi-city flight search for Tokyo - Honolulu - Kahului - Seattle, and the cheapest ticket was over $1800. When I searched for individual one-way tickets for the same dates, the total of all trips was $1238. The ""cheapest"" multi-city price is clearly not truly the cheapest."
2014,2,Where is my option to suggest+ or - days? Why do I have to start over when I change my search criteria? I can't pinch and zoom once you take me to United's web site.
2014,4,I love kayak as a travel app to keep everything in one place and keep me updated while I travel. I would give it 5 stars but Bing as default map software? It really falls down on this point.
2014,2,"Unlike Momondo, there's no option to pick child passenger.  So for me this is useless. I will just have to go on the site then."
2014,2,Can't pinpoint exact address of my location. It has to be city center. Waste of time. Uninstalling. Too bad because the computer version works very well.
2014,1,"I have attempted to book 5 different rooms in Laughlin, NV over the past 2 days and each time kayak failed. I had to call a support number and it still took a half hour after I got to the check in counter...of course, first I had given kayak several different credit card numbers and CVS codes ... Dangerous app!!!"
2014,2,"When I search for flights and find one, KAYAK links me to the website of the agent, however,  it doesnt let me to zoom and read and book on mobile. The words are so small. Please fix this for smart phones too."
2014,4,I travel a lot and find this useful. This is the only app i use for all my travel.  Not getting 5 stars becuase the notifications to people you want to share your itinerary is crappy.
2014,2,"Regarding the flights, it was the most expensive out of most popular travel booking sites like priceline and Travelocity. So I don't recommend using this app if you are trying to find the best deal."
2014,1,I tried booking a flight on the app. Everything was so tiny I couldn't read it. Ended up going online with my laptop to book. Need to be able to zoom in to see anything.
2014,4,"Love the app for quick search of flight fares. Has also got alerts, trends etc. which makes it a very handy n useful.  Waiting for the app to include children booking capabilities.   Good work guys in management and technology for auch a good app!!"
2014,5,I trust kayak because it delivers.  I am against any price manipulation based upon search history and hope kayak never participates.  I clear my casched history on my phone just in case.
2014,3,The placement of functions is not intuitive and switches back and forth between screens so that I mistakenly back out of a search regularly. I only use the app if I really don't have any easy access to a computer. Not a go to app.
2014,2,"Looking for a hotel, and the results say ""Rates starting at $55""...click through and the rates start at $59 - no $55 rooms to be found. In the 28 seconds it took to click through the price went up $4? False advertising? Unreliable quotes every time I browse. Uninstall and no business from me."
2014,4,"I really like searching flights on kayak app, filters are so easy and convenient.  Only thing to fix would be the price alert. I don't get the type of alerts, I want to receive."
2014,4,"One of my favorite pays off using kayak online is the flexible trip options available, I.e. flexible dates and airport options, : didn't see that in the app.   You should get on that kayak!"
2014,5,Though kayak doesn't have the best prices in Europe I still love the app and the presentation. Everything is well synced between phone and PC and the tools for flight tracking trending conversions are added bonuses.
2014,5,"I fly all the time for work so I have become accustomed to searching for good deals on flights. So far I haven't ""one upped"" kayak :)"
2014,4,"Great app, have received better deals than travel agents could give me but the latest version has crashed a few times for no reason."
2014,4,Great app. I use it to research flights. I wish it could allow zooming in when I try to book the flight though. Would also be very helpful to have email alerts for multi city flights
2014,5,"Easy to use, straightforward interface. On Samsung S3, Xiaomi Mi3. I appreciate the feature ""My Trips"". Alerts need still work."
2014,1,"I just found tickets in Delta but once go  there in your app, very very small words and I cannot book ticket, no way to enlarge, so what's the use of this? FIX IT"
2014,5,"I've used Kayak for years to track flights all over the world. It's been especially useful with two unaccompanied minors with connecting flights that arrived early! I love it, wouldn't trust anyone else!"
2014,3,"When I search for a car for rent I get a list of cars but without location address, which is absolutely inconvenient- I must open each and every line to check the location for pick-up. Could you please add location into the list, not only inside of details?"
2014,1,no point setting up an alert.  setting up for direct flights only still returns all crazy options.    waste of time.
2014,3,"Before recently upgrade, I remember it has fight multiple search histories option, which is really good as I can search the same flight in a different day since flight price changes often. Nice if this option is back."
2014,2,Please fix the flight search engine. ..the flight search on the previous version had better search results with various flights compared to this version. .
2014,2,The new update doesn't tell you the date of the flight until you click it. More time consuming.  Really annoying.
2014,2,"This appp would be great except the price alert feature doesn't work. When I try to make an alert, it changes the dates that I want to fly."
2014,4,The Kayak app is very good and a convenient way to quickly check prices and schedules for upcoming trips. Only caveat is the search results start displaying.quickly but then the last 5 percent of the results seem to take forever to load.
2014,4,"Useful when looking for deals. I do have to log in daily to get the daily updates. If you don't log in, you don't get them."
2014,5,"I Love it, I Love it. What a wonderful app for those of us that are looking for  bargains in flts, hotel & cars. Thank-you."
2014,1,"Like some others have said, the new version only gives you the top 10 search results. You got much more variety of results out of the old version"
2014,4,"Works pretty well, most of the time. Sometimes locks up when I go to record my description of the ride and share on FB."
2014,5,"Even when I travel for business and can't purchase tickets through Kayak, I still visit to check all of my options... (sorry Kayak)."
2014,5,"App provides useful details on flights and is smoothly accessible. The only minor flaw is even when i change the currency, the amount is in local currency but logo next to it remains in usd. Can get confusing at times."
2014,2,"Bing maps slow to load, trying to find a place on the beach. I give up. Galaxy4 4glte."
2014,5,This app deserves only 5 stars nothing else if I could give it 10 stars I would.  Great APP to have on your phone.
2014,4,Been using kayak before it was a Bing staple. Its hard to find better air fare unless you go directly to an airline website not  scanned by kayak.
2014,3,"In flight search, the app doesn't have the option to search +/-3 days like the desktop website, so I mostly just end up using the website anyway."
2014,1,Not sure what happened but now whenever I search for hotels only 10 results show up and I am unable to see the rest. Please fix this???
2014,4,I'm new to this apps. Been reading the reviews and many complain about the new version of the apps. So.far I think this ver. is okay.
2014,4,"Great app, but I wish Kayak had integrated their buy/wait advice (which is mostly why I use Kayak in the first place)."
2014,2,This app worked great at the start but for some reason will no longer work - it will not let me add any extra segments or even a new trip.
2014,2,"I miss having a recent flight search history and if you are searching +/- days, the results no longer give you which days are for the quoted price in the summary screen."
2014,4,Does everything I need it to with an intuitive interface. If you like kayak online this app is great too
2014,1,"Trying to add itinerary, all info entered ok Inc start & end date but errors 'you must enter a start date' pretty poor really."
2014,5,It has many features inside. All in one app. Great job
2014,5,One thing I love about this app is what I used to use it on my computer it really streamlined my travel search and provides me travel opportunities and bargains now that they have an app for it.... just makes my life easier when using my tablet or my smartphone I highly recommend it
2014,1,I only see 10 hotel options. I used to see all. Useless now
2014,4,Trips are broken complains about start date even you have to select it from a calender. Also start date in past is impossible.  For the rest great app.
2014,5,I use this app all the time. I use it when looking for flights and it usually is right. It saves me time although I still check...but it has right 99% of the time.
2014,2,Loved the old Kayak. HATE the new one. Features are missing. What the What? ?
2014,2,Loads web browser for checkout that I can't even zoom in on? That was a waste of time.
2014,4,Got me a great deal on my flight last year. Thanks kayak.
2014,5,"Fully Loaded...Has everything you need and then some. If you don't have to Buy it, simply try it and see for yourself."
2014,5,"Acceptional :-one of the best way to get your travel arrangements within your finger touch, all the way helping and saving your time, get guaranteed best deals any time."
2014,5,"I love this app, it would be better if you could book your flight and hotel at the same time (it that does exist on the app, I'm not able to view it)"
2014,5,"Good search good options. Easy to use, just like using site"
2014,4,Work exelent now.I hope it will be remember airlines that I would like to exclude while checking near days of my flight.Thank you.
2014,1,Having problems with price alert the screen is too wide and can't zoom out and won't let me set anything please fix
2014,1,Sucks...I can never actually book with this app!  Always get an error. Wtf?
2014,5,Easy to use. Works great. Thank you kayak!!!
2014,1,For hotel search only shows top 10. I want all my options.
2014,5,Very useful app. Good graphical layout & easy to use
2014,5,Great business tool.  Saves a ton of time finding the best flights.
2014,5,This app actually works better than the website.  That's incredibly rare.
2014,5,It's so far the best app to plan a trip. No need to go to any other site.  It's all here
2014,2,"Works fine for finding flights, but purchasing takes you to a site with unreadably small text that does not allow magnification."
2014,3,"i was able to search for hotels and flights easily before this update, now it barely loads up anything and shows so few hotels."
2014,2,"Hotel search shows ""Featured"" hotels as a default. Some are hours away from where I am. Need setting to select the default search."
2014,4,Surprisingly returns different (flight) results to desktop app. Would have thought it would have had sane search engine.
2014,2,In many ways a good app.  What let's it down is the inability to be able to zoom when trying to book a flight.
2014,5,easy to use and very helpful. Use it for all my trips and automatically adds to my calendar.
2014,5,Great and useful app! Great for frequent flyer. A must have
2014,2,Not getting flight cancelations and delays in time. Flight was delayed 5 hours and it's still showing on time.
2014,3,I like this app because it gives you an idea of what your trip will cost and has a lot of options in terms of scheduling and filters.
2014,2,Can't book a room from the app on my S3! It force closes every time I try! Please fix!
2014,4,Would give a 5 star if I could stretch screen. But prices are great!
2014,4,User friendly. Quick access to  info.
2014,5,I use Kayak for everything. The best rates guaranteed. Highly recommended.
2014,4,Just don't try to book a room the same day that you need it... it will give you heartburn.
2014,5,"It was awesome app, I used it through out my trip in Europe. At times when I missed my flight I was able to find cheaper flights instantly."
2014,2,"Trying to book a hotel, and it's showing me no options to do so."
2014,3,"The app doesn't always find the best prices for tickets, but it does a pretty good job."
2014,5,Saves time and money. Kayak is the real deal.
2014,5,Excelente. Te da información veraz y muy buenas opciones. Lo he usado principalmente para buscar opciones de vuelos. Lo recomiendo
2014,5,Excellent web site.  Everything works properly.

2014,4,"Touring Musician, and this app makes the whole process so much easier. LG G2"
2014,2,I don't like the fact that you cannot do more detail search for hotel for example with free Breakfast
2014,4,"Perfect on: - Design - Multi things to book (Hotel & Airway & car)   ,,,   Bad on: - No zoom - no chart calendar"
2014,4,Would like it better if the option to add multiple destinations ( like on the site) was available.
2014,4,Great app with tons of filter options to get just what you want to see.
2014,4,Compared it with the competion Best prices No lie I got my ticket for this summer Best belive it :)
2014,4,Makes it easy to get a complete trip overview and reminders to check in etc.
2014,5,You just get better ever on flights from all other applications. ..simply great!
2014,4,Wish it would advise me of trip alert with out having to open the app
2014,2,Now only top 10 hotel searches show up...

2014,5,"Great features, just as good functionality as the website... Alerts would be a great add"
2014,5,جامدة ترررررء
2014,1,"It's a tricky one as the app itself is quite nice. Simple and works pretty well, functionally speaking.   My gripe is more to do with the content as I searched for flights and the cheapest price was FOUR times more than the average price of results from other searches on the Web and comparable apps.   My dilemma is that I'm not sure if this is a function of the app or just Kayak full stop, but I'm rating it 1 to highlight the issue regardless."
2014,1,"The flight searches are STILL broken on the Android app; but work just fine on my iPad. ?!  I can search for rental cars from the Android app, etc. but again, no flight searches.  I already un-installed and re-installed and that did not work.  Please fix!  Tech support even got back to after I emailed them twice and I thought they might fix this; but NO. :-("
2014,1,"Useless. Every time I try and serach for a flight, it says it can't connect to the internet. Then the website won't recognize touch input when I'm filling out traveler information. Kayak does nothing for mobile users. You've gotta use a computer or nothing."
2014,4,"I always start searching with Kayak. They've been helping me for years. Just this March, they hooked me up with a great car rental in Los Angeles. I was only there a day and they found me a car for $43 which was perfect for the four of us.   Why four stars and not five? No Southwest fares, and many linked resources. I'm betting no Southwest is a Southwest problem and not Kayak, but I don't know that. The linked resources I also understand, but the thing I want is a compendium of all information. oos."
2014,4,The app works pretty well. I booked a flight to Manila at a very good rate. Upon looking for a hotel though it only showed me 10 results for some reason. I know that there are a lot more than 10 hotels available where I'm going. When I go to the actual website it works a bit better
2014,3,The programmer obviously has overlooked the fact that I can't book e.g. 31st March. The date doesn't exist and I can't manually enter it. The end of June also has problems! Annoying! Just found out that it works in portrait mode but not landscape. So an extra star.
2014,3,"The app itself is one of the best for searching flights.The function ""Multy-City"" is very well.  But (and this is very very sad) the pricing structures and the found flights are rarely the best you can find. Mostly you find better rates if you go to the airlines pages or ceck simutaneously skyscanner..   Additionally the 'taxes' and charges of some of the herewith forewarded sites are barefaced..."
2014,5,Kayak is an amazing portal offering fast precise and neutral travel search. Fully appreciated.  Be it flights hotels or many more it offers a very transparent and detailed brakedown of available options in a jiffy.  It also offers you suggestions on which site to use for final booking. I wonder how they gate their revenues. Kudos to developers.   Nakul
2014,2,"It only notifies me of rate changes when I click to open the app. Isn't the point of ""rate notification"" to actually send the notice to my phone at any time? By the time I remember to check rates, the ""notification"" is already 14 hours old because it wasn't pushed through."
2014,3,"Good app, fast searches, easy to read results. If there's a connecting flight it tells you name of the airport, but not where that airport is.. that could be helpful. Thanks kayak."
2014,4,"- Always shows all flights before allowing filtering for, say, number of stops or travel time. This slows down the experience somewhat.  + Seems to find real flights rather than some other sites which send you to high-pressure agents who tell you that the fight you expected is full and recommend a much less suitable alternative."
2014,5,The app itself is great. Very user friendly. Kayak is pretty great too but can only find hotel rooms for max 4 guest occupancy. Can't search for suites/condos/etc. Does find b&bs though so that's cool.
2014,1,Get a room! Is an affliate of Kayak and the most unprofessional customer service that I have ever dealt with! I called them to try to resolve an issue but instead of listening to my complaint they opted to just hang up! What company does that? Oh and she was also the supervisor on duty!
2014,3,Used to work perfectly. Have issues with the App display size on my HTC OneX.   Features wise it's fantastic.  Please fix the display size /scale issue as it's massively inconvenient to use.
2014,1,Crap app. I go to the site instead. It stays at 99% loading for ev er. Then once flights show it's 99% again and can't use filters. I hate how kayak forces u to use this app or the main site. Their mobile online doesn't allow flight search. All garbage.
2014,5,"I love this app! It's very useful and quick, with tons trip options available! It does occasionally fail to get the prices on the first try, but just retrying again (which is usually very easy and quick) fixes the error."
2014,5,"I usually seem to find the best deal or cheapest price on this app. I do use it for cross country travel and have scope out some international deals as well. This is always the first place I checked. And technically, I have no issues with this operation on my samsung galaxy s3."
2014,2,"Can't refine search as well as on full site, by # of stops or time of day, have to surf through lots of other results.  I wait for a computer to use kayak, even though it's my favorite travel search tool"
2014,1,App reports 'No flights found... No internet connection' when the internet is clearly connected. I noticed the issue after I started using price alerts widget. Running 4.4 on Moto X.
2014,3,Greater emphasis is needed to being able to access your itinerary even when there's no internet access. No value provided if you arrive at your hotel only to find you can't get access to your booking reference and/ or your dinner arrangements because you have no internet access! Duh!
2014,3,This app gets the job done but suffers from not being anywhere as easy or convenient as the online version. I have however found deals on here that the online version doesn't seem to know about.. Sneaky!
2014,1,Price alert feature did not work properly.  I was checking on the price of a flight for weeks.  Price alert told me one price and when I was ready to book it ended up being over $100 more!
2014,4,"Works just as one would need it too. Not complicated, very detailed and visual but concise. Easy to navigate through. But not always the best deal"
2014,5,Best one I've found so far. It lets you set up alerts for price drops so you can get better deals. No annoying registrations or popups. Thank you!
2014,4,"It sometimes doesn't list the detailed the flight and fare options, but a blank page. I suspect that means Kayak couldn't connect to corresponding website. But a blank page is not much of help."
2014,1,I confirm problems with dates and fake internet connection dropouts. Reported to kayak developers but they don't care... they just keep asking me to reinstall app. USELESS !
2014,5,"This app has everything for the traveler. Airport maps, currency exchange rates, rent cars or hotels! People waiting for friends/family can track the flight and see if it is delayed. Great app!"
2014,4,Very Nice app!!!.  4 stars because ticketing app does not have option for kids (below 12) in travelers drop down. Adding that option varies the ticket price quiet a lot.
2014,5,"I've used this app for more than a year I don't have complain about it. Highly recommend you to use it, wherever you are you'll be able to access those great deals from kayak. This is a must have app"
2014,5,"I usually search flights on Kayak. It always gives me the best fares but more importantly gives so many options which are so easy to filter. Time of day,  duration,  class,  airline etc."
2014,2,"Tried booking a flight and it kept giving errors, then when I checked the flight on a PC they wouldn't even show up. Ended up having to book directly through the airline.. Frustrating."
2014,4,"Although I don't like that this app takes to to other sites for ""hidden"" secret hotels, I can generally save time using this app to find the best deals.  Nice."
2014,4,Great app use it as reference point. I've found better deals elsewhere. I usually just Hotwire everything and let the gods decide where I'll stay. :-)
2014,4,"Good interface but many airlines are not listed. Many tines the search by airport names doesn't give results,whereas giving flight no the search is fast and accurate."
2014,5,Went on a very long road trip with two young children. Kayak made finding accommodations on the go pain free and found the best deals! Between the car and hotels our vacation was fantastic! Thank you for the amazing service!!!!  :)
2014,5,"This is by far the best app to use to compare travel pricing and availability, and purchase if desired. The only thing I would change is the date selector. To add a -1, -2, or a +1, +2  to indicate your flexibility in travel dates, instead of the plus/minus value combined.  The ability to forward your trips for the tracker is nice, but it misses some info at times (compared to TripIt). Still, I love Kayak."
2014,2,"On my Galaxy Note it fails to connect to the internet although I have a connection and ask other apps are working. I wished it worked properly, it's designed very well."
2014,4,"I can think of a couple improvements to the app.. but in general it's easy and intuitive. Great app.   Wish there was a way to make a ""favorite airports"" list... We don't use the ones closest to us because the city is cheaper."
2014,4,Flexible fare table like one on the website will be good. Also sometimes shows timeout error in search.  many filter criteria can only be applied after results are displayed.
2014,3,"I mainly use this app to track trips, not make reservations. Its pretty good at that. However, on fairly regular occasions I get a popup that the app stopped unexpectedly"
2014,5,"Finds ALL the flights and all the prices. Multiple currencies. Lots of options and powerful features. If you are a world traveler, it's the only way to go!"
2014,5,"I always find the best travel deals with kayak, never let's me down. Ease of use and simple layout. Great app"
2014,4,Works really great for my needs. Happy to have as my travel companion. No more printing of travel itineraries. Saved some trees for sure.
2014,2,Used to be great. Crashes constantly on Nexus 4. It's been incredibly unstable for close to a year. Latest update fixes nothing.
2014,4,"Overall, Kayak has worked well for me. My only concern is that when I set it up to track prices, I have to log in each week to see the updates."
2014,5,"It will give you prices that are not available on other websites or application such as expedia and priceline. Could be better if there is an option of a package for trip like combining flight, hotels and rental."
2014,5,Used a few times just to search. Very easy to use and results are quick. Haven't use to book yet but will do nearer time. Best one so far
2014,5,I love this app. Great way to check prices for flights. Hotels and such isn't bad. The trip alerts and fare watchers are a great feature.
2014,3,App is really useful but crashes sometimes. Why is the ios version better? Please take some time to improve android's version.
2014,5,Thank you so much for this app I love it. Please add more airlines. Like air asia and tiger airways...
2014,4,although site version include more filters and options - u should add them to the app as well -will be much better -thank you
2014,5,"The only thing conspicuously missing is a package deal features. It will show you flights, and hotels, and rental cars, but no packages combining them."
2014,5,I'm the administrator of a great hotel and Kayak has became an effective tool in order to control parity issues. Also it's been helpful in looking for the best deal for us.
2014,3,Doesn't give accurate information. The website gives different information: much cheaper rates. Plus shows wrong dates after I specify these.
2014,5,This app is reasonably quick for what it does and very easy to use.  Search and filter are well implemented and the ability to book and pay directly from the app rather than opening a browser window is a nice touch.
2014,3,The fare alerts feature is not as easy to use on this as an iPhone. It didn't allow you to delete alerts. Nor does it have the explore feature which I love
2014,5,This is honestly the greatest travel app I've ever used. You can see almost all available flights within your time frame and they have the cheapest options by far.
2014,5,Booked a hotel in South Beach where they quoted me a rate almost double at the front desk moments before.  Walked down the street and booked the room 5 minutes later on my tablet.  We use it all the time and we love the app.
2014,3,"This app used to be perfect, however for the last month or so, when accessing My Trips, I receive a pop up stating I'm not logged in, but I am. The app then hangs until I force it to close."
2014,4,Works pretty good...very easy to use and quick. :) used it to book my 1st solo trip....I'm not a frequent flyer..made it very easy for me.
2014,5,I regularly use this app to book flights. It finds me the best prices on flights all from the convenience of my phone.  Love it!
2014,5,I deleted this app & came back just to check it out. It's so easy and the packing lists are wonderful. The alerts are a big time saver too. Great job!
2014,1,"Search and find a good fare on the app,  go to the website immediately to book and price usually jumps way up. I'm talking 30 seconds later and flight jumps $100."
2014,5,"Love this app. It's easy to see all the flights, itinerary and costs. And it constantly updates any changes."
2014,5,The Buzz feature allows you to quickly see how flight prices vary from month to month. Very cool.  HTC user.
2014,5,My first time using Kayak and was using my smartphone.  Super easy to use.  I was used to most apps not working as well with smartphones compared to a full fledged computer.  I'll be using this app again.
2014,4,"Used for 1 search thus far.  Would not let me rent a car in San Diego and drop off in San Francisco, but that probably is not the app's fault."
2014,1,"If I want to search for available planes, only the main airplanes companies show. The small companies do not show at all! For example: Flynas in Saudi Arabia"
2014,3,Works ok most of the times but returns back an error message atleast 3 out of 10 times. Needs some improvement.
2014,4,"The app is user freindly and very well excuted. One of my best app for checking flight options, highly recommended"
2014,5,Thank you. Helped a lot on the i95 where there as no service this app was  there for us. Speedy service and fast transfers to hotels.....
2014,3,Keeps jumping back up to the top when a new pic loads in slideshow. Impossible to read anything. Also lists lower prices than are available.
2014,5,I travel a lot for work and personally so I'm constantly using kayak to look up flight and rental car information.  Thanks for the great app!
2014,5,This application is wonderful. I've used it on road trips across country and it has helped me get there without any problems and keep track of money spent.  Try it you won't be sorry.
2014,3,Could use some added features.  Would prefer if the buttons said what they did not just ambiguous symbols.
2014,5,Fabulous! Will even create an itinerary on Kayak when the trip is booked elsewhere.  Email and text alerts for flights.. Simply a wonderful service and app
2014,4,Easy to use & I found a. Lot of good deals here. I will use this again thanks!
2014,5,"I have not booked a flight using the app, but the search and price alert options are great. Simple to use."
2014,5,"Reason why I gave it 5 stars cause it includes prices from other hotel sites as well. Interface, etc could use a lil refining though."
2014,4,Love the desktop version so decided to try. Not sure it gives the option to search multiple dates in a single search.
2014,1,"Every time I finished selecting seats and imputing my personal information the app would take me back to the home page right before I tried to make my purchase, 3 times in a row, I simply gave up."
2014,1,"Booked my flight on KAYAK (or so I thought) and after I received a confirmation email, I received another one not too long after saying that there was an error/trouble with the payment going through."
2014,3,"The app is good and the offers are great.but map view does not load properly.i hope they go back to google maps ""it was working good""instead of using bing maps"
2014,4,As the webpage the app is amazing too..I just wished it to have the -+2days chart like in the web ..but its very good still with the list ...
2014,5,I haven't had a need to use it again since my last flight in 2012. Look forward to new features
2014,5,App works really fast and the sorting and filter functions react immediately making trip planning a breeze.  Thanks!
2014,5,"Everything that the site offers is offered here, e.g. sorting and alerts. Easy to read layout with expanded details another plus."
2014,5,Best way to find cheap flights on the web! App works great use it all the time.
2014,4,Simple to use but when searching airports nearby it sometimes gives different airports that fly back into...hard to justify on a roundtrip if you're leaving you car somewhere.
2014,4,I have barely used this app but so far I must say I am very impressed . It has not missed out any airline in its search tool for flights  including  budget airlines.
2014,5,I love this app. So easy to use and find plenty of flights at the best prices.   I've personally used thus app to plan several of my trips and vacations.
2014,4,I have tried the others. Even had a billing issue with one unmentioned travel app. I simply find the Kayak app to be the front runner of all travel app's
2014,5,I love this app. I have bought cheap tickets on Kayak and what I like the most is that I have even bought them through my phone
2014,1,Too many glitches. I cant select multi cities and i cannot setup price alert for a future date. Now i cannot open the app.
2014,5,"Its so EASY to use this app. So, you're just sitting there wondering if its cheaper to drive, or fly and BAM!!! Just like that, you get your answer."
2014,5,"This app is fast, and simple.  I would highly recommend it if you're a frequent Kayak user."
2014,5,"Great app, works perfectly, loads of options, literally half the price of every other site for flights!"
2014,3,"Have booked only one flight, but is a great quick reference for ticket pricing and available times.  Research trips quite a bit."
2014,4,At its speed does best that u can expect...some improvements llike flixible dates and corresponding flexi fare wud add value for travellers....satisfied with results....    :)
2014,5,"Though I do love Turkish Airlines, app's best results are mainly TA. Seems Kayak has long term contract with them) Overall great experience with using the app. Enjoyed."
2014,5,Gets all the sites prices so you only need this one app. Plus it lets you see the calender instead of just the dates. I prefer that.
2014,5,"Problem apparently has been fixed.  Great! ........................................................................................................... Does not connect to internet I've tried to install and uninstall several times and when the app opens it just gives the error ""cannot connect to internet"". All internet connections are working as I am connected to play store."
2014,4,"A little slow at times, but so much information and great deals brought to the phone!"
2014,3,"First time trial multiple stops, the search seem to work however the filter doesn't when applying non stop flights only."
2014,4,"Gives comparative prices and saves time searching.  The app is no longer unbiased as it once was, so you need to be careful interpreting the results."
2014,4,Great search tool. The list is extensive and reflects the best fares available in a snap shot.
2014,5,Love this app. Helps you find fair prices for travel and it remind you of your trips and all of that information. Very complete app in my opinion.
2014,5,Someone is thinking Lola a user.  FINALLY!   Thanks Kayak.
2014,5,It's the only app I like to use. Traveling with four family members can get pricey so I need to know the lowest rate for fights and KAYAK helps do just that!
2014,4,Good on user experience & great functionality. Well thought out & designed?
2014,5,"User friendly and fast. The only one thing I expect form that app is "" forecasting"""
2014,3,I love how the pricing includes taxes and fees. The amount you see is the amount you pay. And the results are fast.
2014,5,I am using Kayak for quite some time. I simply love the my trips and the price alert features.
2014,5,"All travel apps can find you a flight. This one stores your trips just by forwarding an email to ""my trips"" I would be lost without it!"
2014,5,Who doesnt love using Kayak? I could literally book on my phone.
2014,5,The actual detail is amazing I was only browsing but was able to find a great holiday deal which I compared to other companies and this was the greatest price for flights and  hotels also i was able to do it with great easy in a short space of time no longer than 15 mins to sort out brilliant.
2014,5,"Function, accuracy, aesthetics, performance and information quality, all superb. A highly desirable tool."
2014,5,I love the features. Really comes in handy when you are in big airports or change in flight schedules.
2014,5,This App has a tall list of promises and I was doubtful it could actually work that well. I am suitably impressed! Good  work kayak.
2014,3,Good app using browser.  Android version getting better
2014,1,"Every flight I tried to book was unavailable... the prices listed on the app are 60-70 cheaper, but simply don't exist"
2014,4,My only hitch with this app is the general look of the ui. It just looks far too dated
2014,2,There is no package options note does it show you to book more than 4 people
2014,5,Kayak has produced positive results and given me great deals. I love it.
2014,5,Only one I can find that searches with flexible dates.  I love it and it works incredibly.
2014,2,This is not working. It goes  to 99% and no further.  I usually love this. Wtf? I need you.
2014,5,"Love this app. But, miss the explore option that is available in the full website"
2014,5,Excellent app. I think this gives the best prices for flights. . I have found better prices than direct airline sites.
2014,5,Exactly what I need when I travel. Love the real-time updates on flights and gates.
2014,5,Very easy app to use.  Makes searching for a flight simple and gives the best rates.  Search one and done!
2014,5,Very well made and useful app. Love it. Would recommend to anyone flying.
2014,5,I find Kayak great for flights. Priceline may be better for rental cars. Nice mobile app
2014,5,"Works well, very easy to enter and update. I love it."
2014,5,Great app. All in one. Really its nice to have for quick flight search/booking and flight tracking.
2014,5,Great app for comparing airline prices without the mark up.  Easy to use.  GET IT!
2014,5,Great way to search for all types of travel. Easy and quick. It's great!
2014,5,Excellent app. Everything you need to know about your travels right at your fingertips.  Definitely recommend it
2014,5,Love how simple and easy this app is to use.  So much info.  Def recommend!
2014,4,A great app. I always find the best deals.
2014,3,"This app provides affordable flights, but not the lowest rates. Not all that bad, not all that great."
2014,5,Works great! its my #1 flights search.
2014,3,This app is good for Air Ticket Booking. For Hotel booking (I tried for European hotels) other apps are better.
2014,5,Great app.  Good presentation  of options and multiple ways to purchase.
2014,3,Can only check exact dates and airports. It works.
2014,5,"Kayak is convenient, effective, and well laid out. It isn't the only travel app I use, but it is the one I go to first,  and buy from most often ."
2014,4,Allows search for your trips very quickly and provides you almost all possibilities.  Goood filters to get what you're looking for.
2014,1,"Rate shown in dollars only, now again on HTC one stuck at 99% and never showing flight search result"
2014,3,"It's a great app brung the information of the flights, but Not all of the airlines only got the top airlines..."
2014,5,"Super fast, easy to use. Nothing better. Its the best app, really. I love it."
2014,4,"Pretty nifty and easy to use. Misses out on a star for the bugs in the filters, which sometimes don't work."
2014,5,It helps out alot and works excellent. Definitely recommend it.
2014,2,Tired of every time I try to look at flights or rental cars that it goes to 99 percent and just sits there........
2014,5,My go to mobile app for flights. Nice interface.
2014,1,App seem to think because I have a smart phone it can find only expensive fares....removal imminent
2014,4,"I've always used Travelocity for travel,  but I tried Kayak on a whim. I don't think I'll go back."
2014,5,Love this app. I'm a wanderbug so this comes in handy! :)
2014,5,Excellent deals. Cheaper than searching and booking each leg separately.
2014,4,"Good app, does everything it says it should. I have yet to experience any probs."
2014,5,Easy to use... Large choices regarding timing and prices! Amazing!
2014,3,Prices are often correct. Changes higher when you want to book
2014,1,Very easy to use App. But the prices are just ridiculous. .!
2014,4,"find every thing, preparing well to my trip, email it to my company,  but I ask developers to add train search."
2014,4,You have everything you need to organize your trip in the palm of your hand but the GPS tracking thing doesn't work to well.
2014,5,"Works great, I think they should do some graphical analysis to show when the best rates for cars and plane tickets occur."
2014,5,"Good interface, responsive. Do like."
2014,2,"While the website's options are easy to use, the app's controls are limited and useless when planning a tight schedule."
2014,5,I have 3 kids ..all active in travel sports and this app allows me to always have who is where and all the confirmation info I need in 1 convenient location.
2014,4,After tweaking the settings this app is awesome & bang on the money to if you searched separately. Highly recommended
2014,4,Overall a great app. Does what it is supposed to do and helpful at finding low cost travel.
2014,5,Love this app! Saves time and money!  Super easy...loving it :)
2014,2,"Changing portrait to landscape reloads the ticket purchase website for United, loading any says already entered"
2014,4,"App is not the full site, obviously. But they seem to make continuous improvements."
2014,4,"Great way to look at flights.     Sometimes, the results finish downloading slowly,  but not often"
2014,3,"This app finds the lowest fares possible, but app keeps crashing and not searching for fares."
2014,5,I always use this app for flights. Its also cool to find random flights just to imagine what it would cost to go to far off places.

2014,1,"I can use this app to search for flights exactly once. The next time I open the app and try to do a search I get an error message that it can't get to its server or something. If I open Application Manager and clear the cache it works again, but only once. Lame. I'm using a Galaxy S4 on Verizon...like millions of others."
2014,1,The app keeps freezing on my phone I attempted to book a room on here.  After struggling to book a room it was booked for the wrong date. I cancelled the room immediately and tried to contact there customer service.  It has been over 24 hrs and I still cannot get anyone to give me a strait answer I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY OR THERE APP EVER AGAIN!!!
2013,4,"Great interface, amazingly useful, and the overall feature set is more than I expected. What I don't understand is why there's no option to differentiate between adult and child fares? It assumes that all travelers are adults. I had everything ready to book a summer trip for four (two children) to Greece but canceled the whole thing at that point and booked with one of the sites they suggested, to begin with. If there's a legitimate reason for this,j  please make it clear to the users right away."
2013,4,"I really like using this app. It's mostly intuitive, and it gives a lot of freedom to its users.   The only reason I gave it four stars is that the app freezes at times, and does not send me push notifications like it says it will. Lets get this updated!  Love this app! I would also like to see the ability to put my reservations on my calendar."
2014,1,"The date selection process doesn't seem to work correctly. Also, when I initiate a search, the progress bar aborts roughly halfway, saying, ""Oops! No flights found. Check Internet connection."" None of this used to happen, as I recall, so I'm guessing it's an issue introduced in the latest update? In any case, the app is unusable in its current state."
2014,4,"This app is phenomenal. I had used the kayak website a number of times before and found it very satisfactory. It gets you good deals and makes it easy to customize your search to find the most convenient and desirable flights. I found the app just as helpful and easy to use. My  only complaint is that it's prices tend to be a few dollars higher than its competitors such as orbitz, but this is made up for with the user friendliness both in the website and the app that its competitors lack. A great app."
2014,1,"I dont know what is going on with layak, but it seemsto get worse and worse. The dates change to whatever it wants no matter how often you click on a date. And when you finally get a somewhat reasonable date, the results come up as an error or no flights found.. TERRIBLE APP FIX THE BUG OR I AM UNINSTALLING"
2014,3,"This app is great for flight pricing on the go. Wouldn't use any other. The only flaw I've seen is with the price alerts...I've changed the settings but still only get price alert notifications if I open the app and the prices in the price alert do not update on the alert screen, even after refreshing it. If I'm setting a price alert, I'd like to be alerted when there is a price change via the app...simple."
2014,4,Very useful app for road warriors as it let's you build trips which make it easier to keep track of all your travel arrangements.  Its unfortunate that this application has been crashing constantly when initially trying to open it. Recovers quickly and works with no issues until you switch to a different app then crashes again. I'm sure there is a fix on the way. Great app non the less.   BTW this is on an LG G2 - T-Mobile.
2014,2,"This app has become increasingly less helpful on my Nexus 7.   The last time I tried to use it to track a flight it totally failed.  I just reloaded the app, but haven't determined whether or not it will perform!  It is pretty sad when the standard app on my old BB(8330) works better than this."
2013,1,"Within 3 miles I have three hotels a Qhotel (well known) a Premier Inn and an independent hotel.  When I select nearest location to me, this app insists I pick a nearest city/town - where I live is not listed, even though it has been voted best small town in Scotland?  Why can't this app - like most others, use my GPS location and then find hotels by distance from that GPS position."
2014,3,"App is good for the frequent traveler but it is lacking compared to the iphone version, seems to crash frequently, not update settings, have to log in to access user settings and preferences while the iPhone version remembers you. Really needs a face lift to function properly. One annoying thing is it keeps history after looking up flights/cars/hotels long after the date plus keeps your flights in flight tracker after flight has landed(even weeks later) so you have to manually delete every time."
2014,4,"A great site on the desktop version, but I find it a bit tiresome in the mobile version, as I always only look for direct flights. As per usual what started as a good flight search is now being cluttered by hire cars, hotels, etc etc. Inevitable I suppose. Still like it!"
2013,3,I agree with some of the other reviews that's over the years kayak has become less competitive. It used to have very very inexpensive flights and I used it all the time. But over the past several years I've gone away from kayak and started using other sites and getting much lower fares quoted. I still like the aggregating feature I just don't I think the fares are the best out there.
2014,4,"The app does great for searching for flights & hotels. However, there is a frustratingly annoying UI issue when researching hotels that subtracted a star.  If more than one picture is available, the slideshow feature will reset your scrolling to the top. This will happen EVERY 5 seconds."
2014,1,"Terrible customer service. Definitely outsourced. Manager had robotic responses as if pre determined. Booked a room through the app, kayak called after I got the confirmation email that the room was unavailable. They were unable to provide me another room within the hotel or the surrounding area. Extremely inconvenienced and not compensated for waste of time, effort or planning."
2014,4,Variety of companies to choose the best deal from. However there r some companies  not to be trusted n risky to deal with . They take 3-4 days to confirm yr payment. They will confirm yr booking but just sending a simple apology by mail by unknown lady name can mess yr whole trip .
2013,2,"App is OK finding general prices.. But it does not actually show the cheapest rates.   For example,  rates for a South west Airlines flight was triple the rate on the app compared to going to the SWA website and seeing their online only rates prices.   Why doesn't this app show those prices?   Epic failure.   Bring in all prices if you want a higher rating."
2013,1,"Useless app. The calander doesn't allow you to choose the days you want (kept reverting back to a previous search essentially making my travel plans from July thru December!) and once you get it close to what you want (which is the best you can hope for using this app!) it says, ""no flights found. Try again later."" Use yahoo or one of the other travel websites. Don't waste time with this garbage."
2014,1,"So I used the ""near me"" function on the app and booked a hotel that was supposed to be 3 miles away. I jump in a cab and give him thé address and he tells me it's about 26 miles away. I call the hotel and try to get a refund only to find out that it has a 100% no refund policy. I email kayak about the issue and they tell me i have to take it up with the booking agency. I email the booking agency and they tell me i have to take it up with Kayak. So I'm out $71 and kayak will continue to do bad business."
2013,5,"I love this app more than I love my dog! The ""my trips"" feature is amazeballs. Flew to Italy today,  found out my flight was on time through the app, showed my taxi driver the address of the hotel using ""taxi view"" (saved attempting to learn a new language)and had easy access to my booking when I arrived at the hotel. Love - 7 stars!!"
2014,5,Ive been using Kayak since  2006. Ive been able to track the lowest prices for flights and rental vehicles on it and it's always been user friendly. I dont know a site that is just as user friendly with the ability to compare travel options. I have also tried hipmunk and I still see kayak as the best way to compare prices.
2014,1,Restarts app. Can't dial the number of hotel without it freezing. Freezes my phone and had to restart it. Thinks I'm 15 miles away from where I'm at. Please fix. HTC ONE.
2014,1,Will never use again. Wouldnt load right dates in calendar. Would not find any flight results. One of the worst apps i have ever used. I was using a Samsung S 3.
2014,5,"I've been a long time user & promoter of TripIt and never thought I'd switch; however, Kayak has really stepped up their game. While TripIt has dropped features in their newer versions, Kayak has added several to their app. Kayak is now the must have for both the casual traveler and road warriors!"
2014,3,"I used to love this app and use it frequently,  but the upgrade has been a disaster. It keeps saying it has lost the connection. However if you go through Buzz you can access some information.  Please fix this app. It used to be very helpful,  I really am not pleased at all."
2014,1,"Don't know if it's a compatibility issue with the LG g2 buy keep getting error message ""no Internet connection"". Web browser and all other apps are working just fine."
2014,5,Started using this app to check flights and im impressed by the new and improved options it offers now.  Its exactly what I want! Awesome! Saves me so much time having to compare airlines prices dates...thanks kayak!
2014,4,Works great but now it won't find flights due to no internet connection. My device is running internet based apps at the same time so I know the connection is working. Five stars once that bug is resolved.
2014,1,"More often than not, app reports that no flights are available. Price tracker doesn't update. Used to be good, but someone tinkered too much and now it's useless."
2014,4,"No matter where the booking originates, I can keep my entire itinerary in one place. And the taxi view of the hotel is helpful, except in Hong Kong where the driver still had no clue where it was and had lively radio conversations with other drivers til he figured it out."
2014,4,"Absolutely love this app for flight tracking. Wish it would default to ""today"" for my time zone. Not sure if the setting is for GMT or the intl date line but randomly it picks tomorrow... Maybe even yesterday. 5 stars if it consistently would start picking ""today"" per my device's time for flight tracking. Great app..."
2014,3,I like the app but bummed I had to trade using it in exchange for a front row telescope directly up my bung hole... I can only em em three stars since I had to forfit such amazing real estate.  Enjoy my text msgs sycophantys
2013,3,"Average. I love kayak, but bing maps are slow and often poorer in quality. They should be using Google maps. Also, basic filters are not enough. I need to be able to find hotels offering parking, WiFi etc.."
2014,1,"I can't select flight dates properly to check availability and prices. For some reason my return flight is always sometime in August, no matter how many times I tap on the desired date. The main reason I would have this sort of app is for comparing prices, but kayak seems useless for me."
2014,4,Both the site and this app have great information. The app is easy to use and more than once saved my buns while on the road. The only thing is KAYAK's actual website did have better deals on my last flight.
2014,2,"Usually doesn't work. Better off using a desk top computer rather than the app. It's not reliable enough to use on the go, say if your travelling or something like that."
2013,2,UI does not take advatage of larger screen.  App is very buggy. Cannot handle private flights or flights into smaller airfields.
2014,5,"It's a great App. Loved it. It makes my life easier as I can search information using my mobile. It has got filter option too so I can filter down by least price, non stop flights etc."
2014,2,"Trying to search flights and keeps giving an ""oops"" message yet hotel side operates fine. Flight locator worked 10 mins ago with same criteria but won't process now.  Had to go online on Kayak to perform the search successfully outside of the app"
2013,1,Recent update makes the app unusable. Date selection for flights doesn't work. No results are found. The app keeps changing the date you input for takeoff/departure.
2014,4,"All around great prices,  easy to read, and very user friendly. Detailed pictures of locations and hotels. .and you can forward and share the information."
2014,5,"Really fast, its an awesome screen scraper, getting all of the best prices online. I've tried to manually do the same job KAYAK does and I take about ten mins to complete the task with about ten tabs open at once! Keep up the good work!"
2014,4,Only issue I've found is changing the dates for the flight can be annoying when I just want to move it a day or two. Otherwise looks and works great. Very detailed.
2014,2,Takes forever to load. Pretty much stays at 99 loading. Would never load to 100 to give information on flights. Kinda sucks! I really depended on this app to find the best airfare tickets. Fix please!
2013,5,"I've never had any problems with this application whatsoever. Probably use it more than any other app. Easy to use, quick, and never force closes. Thanks for putting the effort into it and making my life that much easier"
2013,5,"As always, Kayak is the only app I need to use for travel, it provides me with all the information I need in one search. I really like that there is a +/- 3 days option in flights; if my trip has flexible dates, I can look for the lowest cost flight. I also like that I can filter the time of day for take off and landing times because we have an infant who flies better during the day."
2014,1,"Normally this is a good app but it's not working. The calendar won't let me choose the dates I want and it says I'm not connected to the Internet when I try to search, although I am."
2014,1,This app used to work great but after the update its useless. It tells me there is no internet connection. Uninstalled and re installed with no luck!
2014,5,I planned my entire trip to Europe on my tab...All through Kayak. Very easy to handle and the search engine works really fast.
2014,4,"They should give more options on pricing hotel rooms. If I start looking at $18/night, it's unlikely that I'd be interested in looking at $358/night. Otherwise, pretty cool."
2014,5,This is a great app for tracking numerous fights. It has maps of the airports so you can maneuver your way around and catch connecting flights. There are many features on this app that are beneficial to frequent travellers.
2014,2,"This was a great app until about 2 weeks ago when I could no longer search for flights.  It keeps telling me it cannot connect to the internet, but the hotels search feature definitely works!"
2014,5,"Great, syncs my itenary with calendar, gets me the lowest price from car rental to flight tickets. All in one travel stop."
2014,1,Can't even change the dates for two way trip...it keeps on falling back to the previous value. This is such a waste of time. Kayak should be punished.
2013,1,Every time I try to buy a flight through British Airways it says uh oh! unable to connect to server. Wtf it says that online too and I'm pretty tech savvy
2014,1,"I'm not sure what happened but Kayak no longer can connect to the network, therefore I get the message (no flights found). I've tried wifi n 4g. I've even uninstalled & reinstalled. So disappointing."
2014,1,Everytime I would try and search flights it would say No flights found. problem with internet connection try again later. And my wifi connection is strong AND network has all bars!! Kayak u need to fix ur app
2014,4,Very easy to find flights in an organized fashion.  The only issue I have is it has some connection problems with the internet occasionally.  Overall I would definitely recommend kayak over searching airline sites : )
2014,5,I have used this app a lot for hotel rooms and flights. works great for both. hotel rooms are sometimes sold out if it is a busy season so refresh to get the updated version
2014,2,Keep getting no internet connection error when connected to either WiFi or 4g. Reinstalled but that didn't help. Verizon galaxy nexus stock.
2014,1,When you try to book a flight there is no option to add children same when booking a motel. Maybe you should put that on your ads we dont cater for familys.
2014,1,This used to be a great app. Last update causes phone to crash and inability to change locations or dates from last search. Really disappointed.  Used to be 5 star
2013,4,"Super convenient! The only issue that I have is when selecting the departure/return dates. It keeps selecting dates that I didn't pick or changing my departure date when I select my return date, etc. Eventually got it right, though."
2013,4,This makes my weekend getaways much easier to plan. .. just wish more airlines were included in searches.  Thanks for the sweet app!
2014,4,Too bad you can't do vacations and the extras that u can do online tho..  It'll be great if you could make a vacation - hotel and flight all together.
2014,5,I travel a lot.  My company requires an itinerary... this is perfect.  It has many other useful features too - all that seem to work when I need them.
2014,1,Essentially the same comment as the last poster. There is a bug when chosing return date and 'no flights' found on common routes. Come on Kayak you can do better than that !
2014,4,I so wish addresses in this app would function as hyperlinks to the Map app. But the organizational tools are priceless--doesn't matter which airline or hotel I booked; all the details are here in one place.
2014,1,I loved this app BUT now I can't search flights! I've power cycle uninstalled the app  and more and still can't search apps. When that gets fixed I'll love the app again.
2014,1,"Try to search for a flight but crappy app tells me ""oops, there was a problem connecting to the internet"". Really? Then how come I'm posting a review using the internet? I guess I must be using a different internet ....,.,,"
2014,1,I've used this app plenty but after last update it's worthless. Screws up the dates I want to travel on then tells me no flights are available? WTF?
2014,4,I seldom have any issues with this app. Upgrades are always good. Only reason why they don't get 5 stars is because I miss the old buzz search (now called Explore).
2013,2,"My husband and I are searching for hotels at the same time, same search criteria, using different devices, but both using kayak and are being quoted different prices :-(  The kayak app on his tablet is giving him more options at lower prices!!! What the ****!"
2014,1,I have installed abs uninstalled  this spp 3xs. It will not allow me to change dates for flight searches. It used to be my favorite app but I'm over it. Taking it off for the last time
2014,2,After changing dates and searching is says no flights found not connected to Internet. Even though tried on wifi and 3g. Much better app on the iPhone
2013,4,"This is quick and gives you a lot of results. Unfortunately out sometimes gives too many, such as nearby airports when you don't want them. Still, this is a good app for travelers."
2014,5,"Traveling made easy and cheap.. Iv flown from Chicago to San Francisco and back.. really works.. youll find the cheapest tickets, now I can travel anytime"
2014,5,"I've only had issues once or twice with the app not letting me choose the right dates for my trips, otherwise this is a very nice app."
2014,3,"Good when it works,  which isn't always.   Excellent way to find cheap rates,  extremely frustrating to have the app crash multiple times when processing payment."
2014,1,WHAT HAPPENED? Thus used to be a great app. It crashes all the time particularly when I try to apply a filter. Garbage results. I'm doing to download a different app. And abandon this one. Bummed
2013,5,"A must have on every phone, for business trips or others.. You can't plan without kayak.   Thanks."
2014,1,"Used to be great. Must have been taken over by idiots. Can not even select a date for flights, you select and it gives you a random date. Useless."
2014,3,I wish you can get the month view first like you can online. Then fine tune it to the best monthly deals out there.
2014,1,"I love their website but their app doesn't work on my phone. When you choose a return date, it reverts the departure date to that return date you just entered."
2014,5,Works amazingly well!! Planned our whole honeymoon on it instead of going through a travel agency and we save a bundle. No joke.
2014,3,", however kayak has a way with searching and sometimes you can find other flights on other search engines.  App just crashed takes me to app store. Uninstall"
2014,2,Please kayak go back to the old app or fix the problems with the search for round trip tickets. Its really messed up. I had to go search online at kayak and could not use the app
2014,1,Love the site but this app just says it can not find flights because it is not connected to the internet.  I signed in and it still did the same thing. Bummer.
2014,5,Superfast and covers all possible options. You don't need any guidence. Great app.
2014,1,This app used to be a great resource.  Recently has only timed out and given error messages for every search. Galaxy Note 3.
2014,1,Can't change the return date on flights. Stuck on Feb. 9. Tried everything nothing works
2013,5,Absolutely loved the app. Works amazing and gives me the best prices. I love how I can clearly see the images and price after taxes for the night
2013,5,"It's a tool that you can depend on. Amazing deals on most of the airlines. Plus, it's very friendly with my mobile OS."
2013,1,Won't complete connection for flight search.  1 star.  Would have given 0 stars if available.  If it gets fixed i could rate it higher.
2014,5,"It is excellent and useful to easily book flight tickets and hotels at a really good price. Moreover, the possibility to check your flight details and status is something considerable. Well done!"
2014,1,Check out FlightAware. It shows the weather and the actual flight path. Not just a straight line from A to B like Kayak
2014,5,"We love kayak, and the app is a lifesaver. All the functionality of the full site, on your phone.  It's great!"
2014,1,Flight options are completely usless. Changes dates then says no flights available. Don't waste you time.
2014,1,Information is inaccurate. Sitting at airport and waiting for flight AI 852. As per Kayak is departed whereas the fact is that AI 851 itself is still to land. Even that is being shown as landed.
2014,4,"Overall very good. I was able to find cheaper deals on other apps, but it is a good tool if u want to do a more comprehensive search."
2014,1,I think kayak is horrible and it never works good when you need it to. I have almost not gotten a  flight due to app not working correctly
2014,4,Awesome would never use anything else for flights. Best prices even better than airlines website No adds and works like the Web page
2014,2,This app is annoying. It will search fine for one go and then every subsequent search attempt ends in an error that says it had a problem connecting to the internet. Not impressed in the least.
2014,1,"Waste of time. Every time it says ""oops! Can't connect!"" after spending a minute trying to search.  Simply doesn't work.  1 star"
2014,5,"This is a very useful tool for scrabbling about to find those bargains we all love!  Works well on my Galaxy 3, but I could do with smaller fingers!"
2013,5,"Powerful interface and rich search options, fast and reliable. It's the only service you'll need."
2014,5,Easy and convenient! Have recommended to friends. Thanks for a great all in one travel app :)
2013,5,Easy to use and delivers lots of options for travel.  Helps you get the best deals.
2014,5,This app is the best one I've used for my travel plans by far. It's fun and easy to use and above all its extremely useful. 5 stars is an understatement.
2014,2,"I love the kayak website, but the app, not so much. It was working fine but then sometimes it tells me it can't get an internet connection even though I have 4g or wireless and alll my other apps are working fine."
2013,1,"Great reception area. Every other app works, this one says can't connect to service."
2013,5,"Amazing app., has everything you need easily accessible with nice interface. Can't comment on purchasing through app though"
2014,1,Expedia shows cheaper flights.  I also don't like that it list's tons of fights that say CALL for price.  What good is that?
2014,1,"Not only do the price alerts not work until you open   the app, but now there are no search results for any of my flights on my s4 or tablet. Back to expedia"
2014,1,See above. Keeps changing my travel dates and thinks I'm in Boston (I'm in NYC). That's both insulting and incorrect.
2014,4,I really love how this app allows you to find multiple flights at one time. Actually I like it much better than the desktop.
2014,4,I love the alerts feature. Allows you a good starting point for finding the best deals.
2014,5,Love the ease of searching flights and being notified of price drops within your trip searches. Definitely will be using kayak to book all my trips from now on :-)
2014,1,"It's my only app that regularly says ""Oops! Problem Connecting to the Internet"" even when the internet is working on my phone otherwise."
2014,1,Keep getting the message that it can't connect to the internet. Something wrong in their side. Galaxy 3
2014,5,"What else can i say. Kayak on the phone is just as awesome as kayak on the internet, all though it does force you to make simpler searches."
2014,5,"I find this app very useful for planning travel,  and especially for traking travel. I originally started using it for the standard format no matter what airline you use.  Also appreciate the ability to access the original invoice."
2014,1,Keeps saying can't connect to internet on my s4. Please fix it I'm trying to keep an eye on flights to vegas. High priority
2013,3,"Everytime I try to look up flights from the widget alerts, it closes, saying no flights...fix it and ill be happy."
2013,4,"Crashes when changing device's screen orientation.  Despite of that, it's the most useful travel tool."
2014,5,Unlike other companies which advertise the lowest prices...Kayak actually finds and delivers! Specifically for international flights with hacker deals.
2013,4,Works well. Some frequently recurring problems relating to internet connection errors are limiting. Unsure of the cause of these errors
2014,4,Perfect for booking and price listing as it will give you the lowest process and you only have to choose.  One problem was that I clicked on a price and got something double the amount.
2014,4,"As a hotel booking site, this app works pretty well. I like that it includes pensions & guesthouses as well as hotels."
2014,2,Was great. Now fails every time I try to find a flight. Please fix. Android device.
2014,1,Saying that they can't find the Internet which is bogus. I can be on wifi and the same message pops up. Tried unintelligible and installing again and the same issue happens.
2013,5,Love this App. Gets me the best deals always when I'm planning to fly:)	My to go to place for all my flights! Always start here!
2013,5,Lot of options to choose from and very easy and quick to obtain information. Very nice app for even the occasional traveler. Thanks
2014,4,"Good job, the best flights finder out there!. Suggestion: I'd like to have an easier way to find historical searching as in the web app."
2014,4,I wish it wouldn't crash so much.   It's a very helpful travel tool.   It's invaluable.
2013,5,There are many features to this app.  I like how you can go month to month to compare flight prices telling you the best time to fly.
2014,1,"I like the service, but only gave it one start because the second I opened it, I get notifications.  **** nope."
2014,5,Consistently finds the best prices and helps to organise your itinerary. I'm currently using it to keep track of a fairly complicated road trip and the more I use it the more impressed I am. Top marks!
2014,5,Price alert feature is the best. I got tickets to Tokyo for $850 because of it. $400 less than the usual price.
2014,5,I am not a world traveler but for the travel that I do I find this extremely helpful for both my flights and hotel reservations.  There may be short comings but I have not found them yet. And the price is right.
2014,5,Easy to use and searches a good amount of travel sites to find you the best deals. 5 stars for sure.
2014,1,Even though I have high speed Internet. Search result says oops unable to connect. Doesn't even deserve 1 star.
2013,1,Tried to search a flight.  It found   flights once then when I changed dates it said it could not find flights.
2014,1,Takes forever to perform.  Wastes my time.  Also doesnt seem to offer the best deals
2014,5,"Wish I could see the calendar in the app version, but otherwise it works great!  Lots of info packed into it."
2014,5,Love this app! Especially the uploading your itinerary feature. It's so handy.
2014,3,"When I use flight tracker in My Trips, go to another app and come back,  kayak crashes every single time. Other than that issue I like the app."
2014,1,"When I go to check air fares, it stops processing and states, No Flights. What's going on?!?!? Have uninstalled and installed and always the SAME THING, UGH!!!"
2014,5,I Love this app. I've booked flights and hotels internationally and its amazing it gives you so many options ! Love love it
2013,5,"What more could you ask for, Thanks Kayak.  Levi Lopes   -Menifee, CA"
2014,5,The best place to find great prices. App is very user friendly. Love it
2014,5,Easily finds varietes of hotels and fast to be used.. The maps are great.
2014,1,Says no flights found and can't connect to internet.  There's nothing wrong with the internet.  All other apps work fine. Useless.
2014,5,I love this for my galaxy s4. Makes pricing and booking flights and hotels fast and easy!
2014,4,Kayak is a great site. They could do to build in some more flexibility options to the app to match it.
2014,5,Does all you need and does it well. Flight prices it presents to me are usually the best I can find on the internet. And I shop around and use comparison sites. Excellent.
2014,5,"I find Kayak great for booking non-direct, long flights....especially to Canada.  They usually always come out with the lowest price."
2014,5,I love this app so much.  It is so useful and Friendly to use when u need to get  a good deal.
2014,4,Search well. I found the best deal here.
2014,4,"Very easy to use, convenient, but need more selection from abroad especially if your home based is outside USA  because it is still very USA - centric apps."
2014,5,"I've used this service when it first popped up a couple of years ago and now its more robust than ever. Brings you the best prices around and with an intuitive app like this one, searching for flights has never been easier."
2014,4,Great app. It does what it says it will do. By simply emailing a reservation confirmation to Kayak it is automatically added to my trip itinerary
2013,5,"Have used in the past  and will continue to use when  booking vacation, or on business.	Thanks for providing a helpful service."
2014,2,70% of the time it.can't connect to the internet and comes back with zero flights. Stick to their traditional website.
2014,5,It has everything I need in a mobile travel app and interfaces very nicely with confirmation emails and calendars.
2014,1,Search doesnt work properly . When I try to enter return date on roundtrip it puts it in as the departure and comes up with a return date 3 wks later . This used to be a good app . What happened ?
2014,5,This APP covers about every aspect of my travel in one app...Go Boston!.. unexpctedly easy to use  ... Not perfect but presently the best for me..
2014,3,Only major carriers. Would be a lot better if all carriers were represented.
2013,4,Keeps all my trip information in one place. Occasionally crashes but just needs to be reopened usually.
2014,5,App works great on all versions of android. Easier to use than web interface.
2013,5,Excellent app.  Does just what you would expect.
2014,4,"Very user-friendly.  Addresses open-jaw flights and provides very shoppable, competitive deals."
2014,5,"Great app,  easy to use & most importantly awesome deals on travel."
2013,5,"Recently downloaded this app and have really been impressed by how quickly I can get the answers I am looking for. A good, solid, well thought out app."
2014,1,S4 I get no flight can't connect to internet ....it used to work fine ..can you fix please ....it only does it when I choose two way flights ..One way works fine
2014,4,This is the easiest way to check all airlines at the same time & it's user friendly
2014,5,"I love using kayak to search for flights.  It is very fast,  accurate, and alerts me on prices daily.  It is the only search engine I use for travel."
2014,4,"Super helpful app..Would give it a 5, but if you make changes to filters it forgets to clear them in new searches, so you have to restart the app"
2014,5,I love kayak because you can compare several website rates in one place not only for flights but for other things as well. Always use it!
2013,5,"I like that online agencies give discounts and packages, but I was getting sick and tired of inflexible search engines, particularly on mobile. Kayak has great filters and let's you do plus or minus 2 day searches even on international flights."
2014,5,I love this better than any other site such as orbitz. I found that if you search by price instead of just first on the list it is about on average $50-75 cheaper.
2014,5,Kayak gives me everything I need to know. Price alerts are great. Baggage fees for numerous airlines are listed. Love this app.
2014,5,This site is awesome! !!!! And truly the least expensive and give alot of information about hotel properties that most sites don't give.This site truly unique and really focused on the small details that makes travel comfortable
2014,4,No issues at all. Could improve the visual layout to present prices in a grid for comparison
2014,1,App in always in zoomed. You can't access right side because the of zoomed appearance. Need a fix
2014,5,"Used this app loads of times. Hardly had any problems with it. Booked flights, hotels, cars on it. All at fairly decent prices. And it's easy to use."
2014,5,Notifications are the best and allowing to keep track of multiple people in one place is great.
2013,5,All your flight times and fares on one site. Love it. Glad you have Southwest on her now.
2014,4,"Good searching, and great calendar integration and historical trip records. Good stuff."
2013,5,My trip has been synced automagically with my calendar. Nice!
2013,1,Keeps telling me no flights to my destination but they are available on my computer.  Must be a bug with the app.
2014,4,Always gives me the best rate. Very user friendly and very reliable.
2014,4,great website and excellent app. Just wish the app had all the filters available in the website.
2014,1,Horrible doesnt load pages.  Keeps saying error on the  page!! Doesnt work at all
2014,5,"Never had issues, I seem to find the best deals on Kayak. Thank you!"
2014,1,"Trying to book a flight, but the screen is white...useless. Will download the actual airline app."
2014,5,"One of the best flight apps I have ever tried,  it has really good features! !"
2014,4,"Good to have at the your fingertips.  However, where's the option for vacations?"
2014,5,This app has the best prices and is always up to date. It syncs with some of my other apps so reserving a room is very easy.
2014,4,Easy to use. The calendar feature could be improved to be more intuitive.
2014,4,I like kayak as a quick search tool.  Simple app to use.
2014,4,Editing trips is a horror. All else worked for me.
2014,5,"Fast and easy to use, details really on spot, no hidden cost, all I can say.. My favourite!  ;):)"
2013,1,Even when using the app on WiFi it keeps saying it disconnects and finds no flights. I have to go to the mobile site instead.
2014,3,Can't change dates on calendar. Very frustrating!
2014,5,I booked 3 trips via kayak now. Great travel tool!
2014,5,Awesome. The same features from their website in a super easy and useful app. Congrats!
2014,5,Very good application! Very precise and information you can rely on!  Time saving and smart.  I love it!
2014,2,Very convinience but quite expensive if you directly log on to home website cheap airplane ticket to find any one.
2014,4,This is the best travel app... Very  useful. Thanks !!
2014,5,Iam kayak.thank you kayak.
2013,5,"Planning our honeymoon on a budget, and not only does the Kayak app show you the best deal, but it also shows you the airline itinerary for the fastest choice to reach your destination."
2014,5,"It's an excellent app. Faster , easy to use , very handy. Best it gives u good rates. I would definitely recommend others to use this app."
2014,1,Is there a bug fix for HTC One??? Totally sucks! Departure date changes when I select return date
2013,5,Prefer this to others eg skyscanner - easier to search & filter results & much easier to see times/other essential details of flights I might want to book
2014,5,Love the explore and multi-stop options. Have booked several flights through this app
2014,4,I use this as well as SkyScanner to find the best deals on flights. I find that skyscanner tends to be cheaper.
2014,5,This is the best app if you want to find cheap airplane flights. Fantastic. I'm indebted to you Kayak!
2014,5,Great flexibility in searches. Easy to use. Makes me want to travel everyday!
2014,5,Great app for travel prices. Really easy to use. Has good simple instructions.
2014,5,Easy to use and to navigate around. The filters are very useful too!
2013,4,OK lots of options. Missing some airlines but I  knew that.
2014,5,Really easy to use... nice controls as well
2014,4,Just downloaded this app.. waiting to see of the price alerts work.. fingers crossed
2013,5,Kayak app is a good as the regular web site. Fast and easy to use. Filters work great.
2014,5,It's like one stop shopping! If you offered cruise info it would be even better. Keep up the good work!!!
2014,1,Keeps telling me no flts and no wifi conx.... Other spps work fine...... Software programmers FIX this !!!!!
2014,5,I love this app! Easy and user friendly. ..
2014,1,"Needs a top of the page option. You ask for a certain option and it won't deliver you to the best option, STUPID!"
2014,5,It's an all-in-one and user friendly app. A convenient organizer for travelers.
2014,5,Love Kayak and its Android app is not an exception. Great job.
2014,3,Cannot make flight filters persistent.  No filter for frequent flyer programs.
2014,5,"Simple,  clean,  accurate.   Good app with a lot of features."
2014,5,Great app to use and gets quick and accurate results. My new go to for travel!
2014,5,Great app. Essential for anyone who travels s lot.
2014,5,Switched from tripit  and am very happy. Great app. I tried a few before I got to this one.
2014,5,Nice app with different  options allowing you to save time and money. Thanks
2014,5,Found super cheap tix to Dublin courtesy of the Kayak alert! :D
2013,5,Works really well. No issues on my gs3 with cm11
2014,5,Very nice design. Was surprised to see such great design for Android app.
2014,1,"When I try searching for flights, it tells me no flights are found because my internet connection was lost, which isn't true."
2014,5,Makes my life easier when I need to travel.  I love it. Excellent application.
2014,5,I never book in any other website. Kayak has never let me down!
2014,5,Use it a lot for quick flight info. Even when travelling.  Kayak rocks
2014,1,Love the website...wished it worked on all android phones
2014,5,Such an awesome application. I didny expect this application will be well developed. Excellent...
2014,5,Very informative and user friendly. Gives you the cheapest flights available.
2014,5,I always go to kayak first when looking for trips. Always.
2013,5,Easy to use.  Quick results. Users friendly.
2013,5,On both devices works Great!
2014,5,Convenient and easy. Compared to all the other sites and they were all cheaper on here.
2013,5,"Fast and feature-rich, works really well."
2014,5,"I use this app quite often. It is among the best re finding good, cheap flights. Try it!"
2014,2,"It used to work and now it keeps telling me that i Can't connect to the internet thus, no flights are being shown."
2014,1,Us ed to be good but now it's almost impossible to select specific day from the calendar
2014,5,Works Awesome!
2014,5,I love it. I have alerts for cheaper airline tickets to my favorite destinations and it is helping a lot with my booking. Love it
2013,5,Use this all the time now. Cars ans flights.
2013,5,Er... done with review.
2013,4,The only thing preventing me from using this app regularly is the lack of searching for flights w/ hotels.
2014,5,"Via a browser or via an app, Kayak sets the standard."
2013,1,The quote they give you and the actual price are two completely different numbers by atleast 200.
2014,5,I love this app especially the car rentals thats a really awsome compare prices when there are so many rental companies thanks kayak
2013,3,"The kayak website is excellent, but this app doesn't provide nearly as many filters as the website."
2014,2,Keeps telling me no flights found for a flight six months from now.
2013,5,Very easy to use. Thank you kayak!!
2014,4,"I would give it five stars, but sometimes I've seen a bit of lag with updating fight information."
2014,2,Before website is much better than the mobile app
2014,5,"I found this app very handy, I got a way better price than I would have on my own."
2014,1,It never connects to the internet. Waste of my time.
2014,5,Nice and easy to use and shows it's own rates next to other agencies whether higher or lower.  Highly recommend.
2014,4,Good app. Needs kid seat. But good overall
2014,1,Junk
2014,5,I love this app. It works  flawlessly on my gs4
2014,1,It doesnt calculate nearest airports and the stops dont show where unless you click in each one....
2014,5,App that always finds the best deal.
2014,5,Works bought five flights on my phone through kayak
2014,4,Some problems with calendar. Besides that it is good!
2014,1,Will not load past 99% when searching for a flight. Uninstalling.

2013,1,"I chose to fly from Cebu, but it used my facebook city, not the city I am flying from. Non refundable mistake because we trust an app. Clearly shows I chose cebu as origin, but flights are being sold as bacolod, 6 hours from here by bus.  I detest apps that think they can think for me."
2013,2,"This app works, but... 1. Its gawky, and reloads often for no reason, talking you back one screen. 2. It doesn't remember its state when leaving the app to say, check email to see if the confirmation email came through (a question the app asked me after I booked a car). Once I went back to the app, it went back to the screen where u approve the booking, not the confirmation screen I left to check email. 3. Its slow. I had my phone on my 25Mbit download wifi and it took FOREVER to load pages."
2013,2,Great app marred by the fact that it doesn't provide the phone numbers of the companies in your itinerary.   Also the app should just stick with google maps - that's where I had to look for the phone #s.  Another (Minor)  problem is the sometimes slow sync when emailing reservations.
2016,1,"Prices shown by kayak are basically arbitrary. Once you go to buy the ticket, in the 30 seconds it takes to transfer to their page, the fare has magically increased $400-500. Kayak weasles put of it by saying ""we're not the seller, we just look the prices up"". Great, except that you just wasted my time."
2014,2,"Downloaded this several times now and it still looks funny on my phone. Icons are stretched and really poor quality, plus the search results page content wont fit in my screen in both vertical and landscape. Deleted and waiting for fix that will make this otherwise useful app...useful."
2013,3,Great site to review all your travel plans.   The ability to look 2 to 3 days to the front or back of dates helps you plan trips in a fiscally conscience way.  Seeing if you can add days to a vacation without breaking the bank is awesome.  It is worth your while to use this site. Thanks.
2013,3,"...doesn't properly display on HTC One X+, I guess it thinks it's a tablet. On home screen icons are stretched (not displayed as a list) and I need to use landscape view to select the last 2 days of the week in the calendar. Would rate 4 stars otherwise."
2013,4,"This app offers a variety  of options ranging from one way/round trips, least expensive,  alternative dates, and more.   The only shortcoming is that it does not offer an opportunity to choose departure time(s), which would narrow the search tremendously."
2013,5,"The one feature that would be most useful is the ability to switch arriving and departing airports.  Often I like to look at the price of one way tickets separetly instead of the round trip to see which way is more expensive.  Switching back and forth is time consuming.  If there were a button to simply switch the 2 airport, it would be very appreciated but still a great app without it."
2013,1,"Please don't use them but if you do, go with caution. Recently used them, told them my parameters and they didn't listen to nothing I said. They put working people in secluded hotel where drugs and prostitution. Ended up paying for somewhere we didn't stay. They won't return my calls or emails, no refund.  You'll are trash, God won't allow you to stay in business messing with his children. Hope He show you the mercy you didn't show us."
2013,5,"Love the amount of information. I'm particularly impressed that the app shows flight times for flights they don't even sell!   My only request would be that you have the option to select departures and arrivals independently, on different screens... Maybe the desktop version allows that?!   Either way, keep up the great work!"
2013,2,The app crashes every time I use it extensively. It refreshes data when it shouldn't and doesn't cache it when it should. The filtering and sorting options should be mirrored more from their site and have an option to set those options as defaults.
2013,5,I love this app! My husband lives in another country and I gat the updates daily as well as able to see the seasons or days during the month that make a trip for us to go see him affordable. I wish the alerts would pop up automatically on my top bar though.
2013,3,"Good app. Easy to use, reliable. Be careful with what airports it flys you to or from. It likes to give me airports that are more than an hour and a half from my starting or end points. Thos includes ferry rides and drives through mountain passes that would take longer than the flight itself"
2013,5,"I always check kayak first for all competing markets of all airlines. You can modify your search by number of stops, durations, times for takeoff and landing, which airlines and more.  Filter option is terrific. ."
2013,1,"Finally loaded the 14mb app on this airport wifi, but the search keeps failing. Sometimes gets to +90% complete, but always fails. So then, useless for me. They need to make the search much less sensitive to the data connection."
2013,5,"I am a frequent business traveler and this app saved me so many times. If I have a canceled flight, this allows me to already know all possible options by the time I walk up to the counter. Knowledge is power:)"
2013,4,"Search engine is very inclusive but lacks search for packages and hotel map is difficult to maneuver without nimble fingers. All in all, I use it to compare prices at a glance."
2013,4,"This is usually where I can find the best deals. It has been a long time since I have used the app, but I like being able to tell from the side calendar/ grid which days are cheaper to fly"
2013,4,This is a great app. I found a good hotel room and price for my family. I would give it a 5 if it had all the options the desktop has.
2013,5,Awesome app. Let's me keep all my trips in one place. Also gives real time updates during flights. It even tells you where you can grab your luggage once you land.
2013,5,"Any option I wished I had in researching trips, I actually did have! Love looking for flights now instead of dreading it."
2013,4,A pretty good tool but could use a few extra tools for the veteran tourists	I use this as a default infirmation finder. But invariably use other sites to book. It needs a few tweaks to make it really useful.
2013,5,This is my go to resource anytime I'm planning a trip. It's the best prices I've found for airline tickets and really easy to use. I love the flexible day option for flights!
2013,4,Some of the parameters cannot be chosen in the initial search and then when you change it it takes so long to display as if it was another search. What would also be really cool would be to show type of airplane. All airlines have their timetables publicly available so it would just be a matter of cross referencing.
2013,5,I just barely discovered kayak. Life changer! I normally spend weeks researching flights on different sights. I was hooked when I booked a last minute flight to visit my friend over Christmas. I usually would end up paying over $500 but I found flights that worked with my schedule and were so much cheaper! So easy to use. Love it!!!
2013,4,I have used kayak website before and now the apps. The only thing I could not find is the flexibility of date which gives better prices with one or two dates up and down. Otherwise its a five star apps.
2013,5,This is the best app i have ever seen for airline tickets. Cheapest airfares and amazing interface. Airport location and their maps for easy routing..
2013,1,Nexus 4 with android 4.3. Pervious versions worked fine. Can't see the whole setting screen in the newest version.
2013,5,Must have! Always shows BEST rates AND has an awesome itinerary section to organize all your travel plans! Love this app! Syncs with Android and Apple devices.
2013,2,What happened to this app? Seems badly optimized for a phone screen especially the start screen. Also seems to leak memory. I get low memory warnings. I never get those with other apps.
2013,3,Keeps saying it can't reach Expedia's servers every time I get to checkout. Loved this while it worked but it doesn't work any more. Look forward to seeing a fix but I'm not holding out hope.
2013,5,I use this app often for planetickets - and also just for daydreaming about my next trip(s). Works like a charm!
2013,5,"Great app!  It's nice to have a simple to use, quick app that doesn't have ads. ""Nuff Said"" -Works great on my Verizon Note 3"
2013,4,"Useful reference tool especially for mobile, although still lacking some airlines. Could do with one or two of the website features like trends and recommendations for when to book."
2013,4,Would be nice if one could search vacation packages instead of just stand alone flights and hotels. Still better than the expedia app though.
2013,4,"Great app for travelers. Even have last minute bookings. Even better it also shows comparison prices from Expedia, Priceline etc. Good job!"
2013,5,Overall great app. Really impressed by how user friendly it is. It would be even better if you could save your favourite flights.
2013,5,Love the app! I'm a business traveler...one trip per month. Love the packing lists and fare alerts. UI is very nice!
2014,1,The new app is not working  n my Nexus 5.  Not sure if it's the Vanilla Android but the app is not working.
2013,5,"Kayak is very helpful,  I like how it often gives the option to go to the website. It gives good deals and suggestions of where to dine or activities while out"
2013,5,"This app is very innovative. Unlike the third party agent sites, kayak will search all airlines in their respective official sites and gives a comprehensive list. It shows the best fares and I have always saved a lot by checking the fares here.. Thanx guys.. Awesome app..!!"
2013,4,"I've booked 11 flights since I got this app.  Some for business and some for pleasure,and some for friends,   the prices and times have always been spot on!"
2013,4,Super app and cleanest interface for all searches. Only drawback was that prices seemed to be higher than other similar search apps.
2013,5,Great options. Neat / clean layout. Love setting price alerts. Nice to see prices w taxes included. :-)
2014,5,Surprised to find so many features tucked neatly into my small screen. Thanks kayak!
2013,5,"LG G2. No glitches, accurate prices and informs me of deals in the least annoying way possible. 100% recommend!"
2013,4,"Pretty good app. The bing map is fine, but the price bubble placement is wonky."
2013,2,Im going to uninstall this app as it  keeps crashing and froze my phone. I had to restart the phone for it to be usable again. Its very scary.
2013,4,Quickly gets airline and hotel information. Great if you're already on the way and need last minute changes.
2013,5,Best ticket ordering app I've ever used. Very user friendly and intuitive.  Better then the desktop version.
2013,5,"Haven't had the chance to book anything, but it gives you lots of options, and is pretty intuitive for filtering the results."
2013,4,Using kayak for international travel is very inconsistent. It often shows no flights available to certain destinations when there r actually lots. US domestic travel is great!!!
2013,5,Easy to use and usually competitive pricing. This is where I do my searches even if I buy through another site.
2013,4,"Great app, just wish new fare notifications could happen without having to reopen the app. Otherwise maybe needs more cowbell?"
2013,5,"Love the app.  Easy to use interface,  anyone can start using it within few seconds,  and you actually get great price."
2013,5,It does a good job notifying me of updated flight info. Easy to use. On Galaxy Note II.
2013,5,This is my do to app for great travel deals.   All sorted quickly.
2013,4,Useful for comparing rates and filtering on hotels you want to check into. Haven't found any glitches yet.
2013,4,Great search function. The trip planner aspect is still not as smooth as tripit but it's getting there.
2013,5,Searched and booked easily.  No gimmicks.  Love the update on flights. And the show me deals thing.
2013,4,Does not include low cost airlines. A couple of sites were such as cheap tickets do not have the advertised price. Hotels were expensive
2013,3,Highly re ommend for those that do alot of traveling. Very esay to use and convenient!!
2013,5,Easy.  Daily updates via email/text a real plus when planning the family vacation on a budget.
2013,4,"Great mobile adaptation of the website. The added flight tracker is nice, although notifications would be a good addition to take it to the next level"
2013,3,"Like it a lot, but I'd like it even better if it allowed me to enter letters in the postal code box for booking. Without them, I couldn't confirm my card."
2013,5,I love this app! I mainly use it for buying flight tickets and tracking flights. The flight tracker is in my opinion the best one out there (by far).
2013,5,"Useful app. In addition to finding plane tickets and hotels, I've even begun using their currency converter when working with International students. :)"
2013,3,Where is the option for  young travellers (kids and infants) in app (flights)....am i missing something  here? ........ yes i am.
2013,5,"I've now booked a number of flights directly from this app. They are always the cheapest available including any individual carriers sales. It is exceedingly easy to book, compare and monitor flights. Highly recommended."
2013,5,This would have to be the best app yet for complete travel organisation. Combined with a good email client you got everything you need for travelling and when in transit. Wont be using anything else now Iv found this.
2013,5,Great flight tracker and automated calendar sync. Honest and upfront pricing on hotels and airfare. Must have
2013,5,It works better than any other site. Thank you.
2013,4,It is a nice app. I think it is a little cumbersome. I wish you could select more than one sort item like distance & low to high price.
2013,4,Great app but still needs some work. It would be nice to filter the multiple airline bit also by the airlines that I want to see.
2013,5,Added change log for updates. App is phenomenal! Kayak is my go-to! S4 running 4.3 on Sprint.
2013,4,Only program I found easier to use is Orbitz app. Will keep both on my phone since I travel quite a bit
2013,5,"Great app for searching for flights, hotels, deals, and whatever else may have you."
2013,5,I love using this to plan my trips! Always the best deal on everything.
2013,5,"I book flights tickets n this app is just amazing, must have app for android users..... Thanx kayak"
2013,4,"Keeping it short, this app is pretty awesome. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because they still don't have the vacation package search like on the web."
2013,4,Great app but should have children option when booking flights and hotels. Makes a difference when it comes to the final price.
2013,3,It's a good app and does what I need it to do but I think that train and bus trips need to be added.
2013,5,I love this app..has all the features I need . Flight tracker is more accurate then other flight tracking apps.
2013,3,I didn't like that many of the prices were wrong and that most of the flights I tried to pick were already full. It's an okay app but not so reliable
2013,5,"I have been using Kayak for a few years and it's never let me down. I will continue until something better comes along, but won't hold my breath."
2013,4,"Could use some additional features around ""include nearby airports"" but otherwise is great!"
2013,5,Great app. Works well with high speed. Highly recommended!
2013,2,The app fails to load and track vessels worse now since the price was attached than when it was free. Don't waste your money.
2013,5,Easy to use. Don't use the search for flights function but it is brilliant for storing all my upcoming flight info and love the packing list function!
2013,4,Very handy and quick! User friendly also.
2013,5,Love the concept. App is just as good.
2013,5,Super user friendly app to book your itinerary or just to look at what options are available. I highly recommend it.
2013,4,"Nice layout, fast response, comprehensive travel info. ."
2013,5,Finds the best rate every time...compared the rates for each hotel and shows you the least expensive place to book! Love it!
2013,5,"User friendly. I like that you can select your price range, times, stars very easy."
2013,4,I use kayak for all of my traveling. Works great!
2013,3,...but needs more accurate pricing. Airline sites show lower prices and more recent rates.
2013,4,There are some issues but on the whole it works   well
2013,4,"Lots of options. A little slow, but otherwise super useful."
2013,1,I searched for flights and they show up cheap on little airlines like alaska then they vanished to show delta at 50%+ higher rates.
2013,5,It's a great app especially since the idiots at Air Canada can't be bothered to make a working app for their android customers
2013,5,I am very pleased with this product. I have booked a couple of rooms and have had no problems.   Great search service around the world.   Top quality.
2013,5,Used them to find cheap flight to Poland it was super easy to use and very customer friendly. Have been ripped off by other travel sites so was a little Leary about using it but everything worked out better then expected.
2013,5,New version works great and follow the android GUI conventions.
2013,3,"Used it a lot on prior trips, but now it keeps listing past trips instead of future ones. Also, finding related events is more complex."
2013,2,Very slow loading and lots of FCs for no reason but very good interface. DHD 2.3.5 Rooted
2013,3,Lately the times have been off on flight arrivals. Planes have landed and the app  will not show landed like it use too just the time it's suppose to land.
2013,5,This app is very user friendly and has to many info options when deciding to travel.
2013,2,Unlike the full site there is no way to select a 1-3 day date range for the departure date. Cant imagine that would have been hard to add.
2013,4,Kayak is great! It's very helpful.
2013,4,This app is easier to use than many airline websites.  Good job.
2013,5,Great development. Easy to use with options that make it stand out over other apps
2013,5,"Visiting from Saudi Arabia.. Loved this app to do all my reservations.. Flights,car rental, and hotels..i also tracked all my flights.."
2013,3,Comprehensive and an indispensable travel tool but can be improved with simple things like increasing the miniscule almost unreadable font on the flight sort menu!
2013,5,Thank you kyak for helping me keep my options open. Seriously.
2013,5,Best app does so much more than just compare flights. Was a life saver when booking my 8 week holiday to Europe!
2013,4,"Edit working againKeep receiving oops can't connect to Internet message on S3. WIFI data is on, and all other apps connect. Please fix."
2013,5,Love this app. Right at my finger tips i can book a hotel it's quick and very fast.
2013,5,"Works well, good info but not very intuitive to use.  A little clunky but w good results"
2013,5,Great app especially when out and about and need to look quickly..... Finds all the good deals !!!!
2013,5,Kayak is my favorite  application when it comes to travel related apps. From UI to backend functionality .
2013,1,Constant freeze ups & hangs.  No longer works.   Deleted.
2013,4,if the possibility to filter airlines based on networks like star alliance had been implemented i would give this app five stars
2013,5,We have used kayak for several years now with excellent results. Thank you Kayak!
2013,5,Used it for 5 minutes and booked a week in Cancun because of the great deal.
2013,3,Would like it if the filter would remember preferences so I don't have to redo them for each search.
2013,5,No issues what so ever. Best site I have found. Very easy to use
2013,4,I travel all the time for work this has helped me out! I always find a great room at an awesome price
2013,4,Good prices.  Can't figure out how to save this review!
2013,5,"Would like to see a price matrix for +/- days (on a flight) like the website, but other than that a top notch app."
2013,5,"Leaves out a few options, but it's a great app."
2013,5,make my travelling arrangement easier..thank you a zillion.
2013,5,Very easy to use. Essential tool when searching flights and hotels.
2013,5,"I often get different results from my mobile app searches than from my computer, though (even when searching at the exact same time)"
2013,5,"Simple, yet efficient and works well. Highly recommended."
2013,1,"Les résultats des recherches s'affichentpuis disparaissent avec un message disant qu'ils on été filtrés et qu'il faut appuyer pour tout afficher, mais ça ne marche pas!"
2013,5,Fully integrated with email travel receipt and also works with calendar
2013,4,"Easy to use, i only wish it had the fare tracker like on the website so I could see what days are cheaper to travel on."
2013,4,Love this ap
2013,4,I dig this site. Easy to use. Fast search results. Use it everytime I travel.
2013,5,Fun flight tracker app & so convenient a search tool. Love it.
2013,5,Easy to use and full of information. Keep up the good work.
2013,5,All you need in one place.  Bravo to the developers that make it possible.  And to the product manager who keeps nagging :p
2013,4,Wish swa and some others would participate. ..
2013,5,Wish I could see the low fare calendar though.
2013,5,"Ive used this app many times to buy my tickets and I love it , and if u keep looking , you find deals better than the one you think you have"
2013,5,Love the app just wish the price alerts would really alert u when they change....it won't tell u till u click on the price alert
2013,5,"Been back and forth between Florida and Colorado, finding better fares than travel agent.  Cliff P."
2013,4,Works great. No problems to date
2013,4,...the ticket price alarm never worked :(
2013,1,I know there's better deals out there give me them.
2013,5,Works without any issues and not complicated.
2013,5,Awesome app. Very easy to use. I like the extra touches such as the packing list.
2013,5,Great deals. I always go with more stars and find great hotwls at great prices.
2013,5,I get all the great prices for flights.  A must have app if u travel a lot.
2013,5,All in one app. Searches multiple suppliers. Recommended!
2013,5,Best flight fare app I've used. Purchased tickets with it n I will do again.
2013,5,Great app handy for all my travel needs. Especially flight bookings & itineraries. Very simple to work.
2016,5,It is very useful app.. i use it during all my travels
2013,4,Nice info... The widget needs to have multiple sizes...
2013,5,Love the easy access to the filters in the app
2013,5,Kayak is my preferred travel app for becoming a personal travel agent.  This app is highly recommended!
2013,5,"Smooth, user friendly and clean! Love it!"
2013,5,This is the only app on my phone that I NEVER had a problem with!!! Don't change anything!!!!
2013,4,"Апп суперский работает очень быстро,прост в обращении.вот только не всегда совпадает с сайтом.а так все супер"
2013,5,App is easy to use! Lowest fares you can find. Well deserved 5 stars
2013,5,Giving great indicators and options for me
2013,5,"User friendly, simple interface, just did what it should :)"
2013,5,Easy app to use. Great bargain hunter.
2013,5,Great app. So easy yo use and filter. Use more the expedia and priceline.
2013,5,Been using it for all my trips since last year. Love it!
2013,1,I was in love with this app but lately it keeps crashing and hanging my nexus 7 when I am not even using it.  I might have to uninstall it.
2013,5,Great app. Really love the real time status update feature
2013,5,Love it! Easy to use. Have had no problems. Makes traveling easy and stress free!
2013,5,Super easy search features. Great app to search multiple airlines.
2013,2,This app needs some serious love from the dev team. Does not have all of the functionality of the site.
2013,5,Always seems to find lowest prices
2013,5,"Easy to use, makes it easy to search lots of different flights in a short amount of time. A must have travel app."
2013,5,We use Kayak every time we go on vacation.  I love being able to have the gate # and flight tracker!
2013,5,Easy to use. Simplistic. Fast loading. Logical.  All around good travel app.
2013,3,The prices are great! But I'd like to be able to narrow the reaults by depart times.
2013,4,Well done for the enhanced way how one could find best bargains in the crammed world.
2013,1,Loads to 99% then tells me I have an internet problem. So far this app is useless.
2013,5,"Love it, works very well!!  GS3"
2013,5,Kayak is great for keeping track of my trips...had some problems with it not loading my trips but upgrades seem to have fixed that!
2013,5,Works well and is super useful for the busy businessman.
2013,5,Best in android. Southwest should add themselves to this.
2013,5,It works well.
2013,4,Just buy right away because if you check back again later the price is always higher.
2013,5,All in one app....nothing else needed
2013,5,Works great! Always find the best deals!
2013,5,"Love it, glad I downloaded this. Very useful for upcoming trips!!"
2013,4,I'm in US Miltary. Wish you  could get military discount prices also but I love it.
2013,4,"Love this easy app, just wish it gave you more options out different flight routes automatically."
2013,5,easy to use and notification works well...
2013,3,They need to improve the alerts on the prices because I never received an alert even when the price went down
2013,4,Easy to use.  Lots of information. Use this all the time.
2013,4,Have not booked yet... But if it is as easy as looking for flights and hotels I can't wait to book
2013,4,Great utility but the design needs to be changed and made flatter and simpler. Feels too archaic
2013,5,Best search app for great deals on trips!
2013,3,Hard time booking it. It said it was sold out but another Orbitz was easy to book.
2013,5,"Great app. I use it for airline bookings all the time to compare, then will go directly to the airline that has the best flight and price"
2013,5,This site always has the cheapest deals and an easy to use interface.
2013,5,Easy to use and very resourceful!!!....great deals too!!
2013,5,"Lots of features, clean UI, reliable accuracy"
2013,5,Very very accessible! !
2013,1,Font size is much bigger in Nexus 4 and it goes out of the screen.
2013,3,I have used the car rental part and got really good deals..Quality App
2013,5,I love this app! I get flights Really cheap.
2013,5,Have used this app a lot. Very useful.
2013,4,This app has helped in making comparisons of flights by multiple airlines for travel / prices.	A good site for price checking.
2013,4,I like the fare alerts and it is easy to use. Seems to be the cheapest fares I've found.
2013,4,I love using the kayak app. Being able to set alerts and check for flights at any time is great.
2013,5,Its a really good app to find   hotels and check flight status and much more related to travel ........its a great app I will give 5 star
2013,5,Kayak best application. Thank you.
2013,4,Easy and user friendly. Thanks.
2013,4,Very effective and easy to use. If the app liked better I world give it 5 starts
2013,4,While loading results it has really cheap flights but once all of the results load the cheapest flights dissapear
2013,5,Good job
2013,5,"Kayak usually has the best flights to choose from, only issue I'll have sometimes is connecting to the other flights' site."
2013,4,I have never used it to book tickets.  But as a quick reference this app is great.
2013,4,looks gud. price alert at anytime when the price is found would be nice instead of once daily
2013,2,"Once all the search results are in, They all disappear and it tells me 'all results filtered'"
2013,4,Quite a well designed app. Visually pleasing and very responsive.

2013,2,I liked the kayak Windows Phone app Better than the Android version. For ex:there is no way to deactivate alerts once you set them.. at least I could find out how to do it after setting up. .. this app is going to the trash
2013,1,"When I pinch to zoom on the map, the app moves the map centre position as well as zooming in. If I tap on a hotel position price bubble (e.g. £100) from the map, it opens with a hotel that is more expensive (e.g. £150). I then tap on a bubble in a nearby, yet distinct location, offering a different different price to the first bubble (e.g. £125), and get the same hotel as I offered by clicking on the first bubble at the more expensive price (£150). This is completely unusable."
2013,2,The trip organizer is crazy awesome on the website.  The hotel finder needs a lot of work. The map search is terrible and hotels seem to be limited.  But the goodness of the organization functions completely outweighs the negatives. Or it did until everything went completely buggy and massively unstable.
2013,2,Not bad for finding flights but it is garbage for hotels. The Bing map is terrible. It is so slow to zoom in/out. I gave up due to frustration. I am using a Galaxy S4 on 4G LTE.
2013,2,"I tried tracking my wife's flight, and it just fails all over. First off, when I'm trying to type in the flight number, it's a black background with black text, so I can only hope I'm not mistyping as I go. Once I made it through flaming hoop number one, I noticed the arrival time was about an hour later than it was supposed to be. Now, a half hour before I think she's supposed to land, it says she landed (an hour and a half before the reportedly scheduled time). None of this jives with the airline's site."
2013,1,"I can't add flights that are more than 3 days out. I have older relatives traveling abroad, and need to add the flights to the list for them. I can't do half of their trip there, or any of it coming back. Now they'll have to fumble around with papers trying to figure out the times and places of where they need to be. This was so disappointing. Uninstalled."
2013,2,"If you accidentally turn your phone, you have to start all over. That happened a few times. Then, when I finally made it to the end, it couldn't process the transaction. Had to do it online where I was charged a higher price."
2013,4,Tidy app that's very useful. It misses some details that the standard website has but ultimately this app works very well. The devs are super speedy in responding and have so far fixed problems for the app and for their website when view on either Android and WP8 Explorer.  So far very very good.
2013,5,"I travel a lot for business & pay my own expenses. Kayak is efficient and does a good job of finding cheap fares, cars for hire, and hotels. I compare it to other tools occasionally like it just to stay honest and it wins almost all the time."
2013,5,"I'd always used Expedia to book all my flights and hotels, I used to think Kayak was just s comparison tool and not an actual searching tool. Once I got the hang of it though it's the only website I use. I've booked several flights and hotels on my tablet with the Kayak app and they have gone through with no problems. Love Kayak!!"
2013,3,"App crashes continually on nexus 7. Recent update has caused widget to be unusable. Also,  prices online from kayak are different than those show by the app."
2013,4,"Application works well and has lots of options, including price tracker. Only thing I don't like is that the application shows false results of cheaper prices while the results are loading. How do I get those cheaper prices?!"
2013,1,"Keep getting ""enter from in leg 1"" error with no way to fix it. It doesn't even have ""from"" section! Just ""depart"", ""arrival"" and ""date"" with annoying dash on red circle whenever I try to enter airport information in vain. Lame, lame, lame. Fix this annoying non-feature."
2013,5,I can't imagine planning a vacation without Kayak. Thank you. You have saved me and my family thousands.  My only wish is to incorporate prices from expedia an others that are currently in extra search.  Very happy
2013,3,"I think this app is very easy to use and easy on the eye. The problem I have is that is doesn't account for young travelers, children and babies. If this feature were to be added it would certainly be the best travel app on the market."
2013,4,This is the easiest / most robust search and booking app I've found. But I miss some features of the full site -- notably ability to search for upcoming weekends vs. specific dates
2013,4,"Ease of use is good.  Noticed an error.  Though the flight lands on the same day,  there is a display saying the flight lands on next day.  Possibly because of time zone error!"
2013,4,"The last time I installed this app, I uninstalled it because I didn't like the layout. Much better now! Cleaner and easier to use. Thanks!"
2013,4,"Fantastic app... A few things  are lacking. Automatic trips taking a little long. After adding 1event to the trip, there is no way to enter another event. Like return ticket."
2013,3,nedd to do some more work to fix the problem. feel very irritated when you have to do work again. thanks
2013,5,"Easy to use, simple, gives me exactly what I need not too much or to little. Have.experienced no problems or bugs. I recommend it highly."
2013,4,Love that everything is in one place. I don't have to choose what sites I want to check. I Just look for the cheapest or most convenient flight that's what I want and that's what I get with kayak.
2013,3,"Love app, but last update is crashing left and right on 4.1.2 & 4.3. Randomly but maps and pictures appear to be the main point of failure."
2013,5,"Only one day of use and can say it's really a good app. Results are pretty fast. Easy to use, you can't loose! Thanks!"
2013,5,"Just marvellous. Very user-friendly, with great navigation, and nicely designed. Can't believe I didn't install it earlier! Definitely recommend this app for all travellers :-)"
2013,5,Saved me a lot of headache when weather delayed my flight. Great flight status feature & love that I can find the best rates & times on flights with its range of travel day options.
2013,5,"Love, love, love.. Its so easy to find the affordable flight even  last minute. I often check for great deals before I book it:) I'm hoping to travel all over the world...."
2013,4,App desing and function work well. However I've found the prices to be off sometimes. Always double check with main airline sites. . I know it defeats the purpose of an efficiency app but hey..
2013,5,"Makes this app easy to use.  More options to choose from, better selections. Far better than Expedia, which was pretty good at the time."
2013,5,"Very good app, a very must app for frequent travellers keeping in mind recent foray of international carriers into Indian markets, courtesy Indian Govt's FDI policy.	Filled with almost every feature."
2013,5,Kayak works well. Can't think of anything it should do better except maybe pack my bags for me.
2013,5,"Such a quick and easy app to use. Has flight times and prices, hotels, cars, currency converter and even lists of things not to forget. This app is great. Highly reccomended."
2013,1,"App forgot my information several times, and at the pay screen just locked me out. I'm surprised I had the patience to try it more than twice."
2013,5,Exactly what I needed to keep track of all my travel info.  Especially like the check-in email I get...
2013,4,Great app. It gives me exactly what I'm looking for. Just a remark; I think that it should consider low cost airlines too.
2013,4,"Why? And why no explanation? No way I'm updating. People need to ""like"" the reviews that challenge app developers that pull this crap. Otherwise, no one will be warned before installing, as such reviews won't be shown first for being ""most helpful."""
2013,5,"All you need, except for decent widgets. Then it would be 6 star and I would stop using a competitor. :-)"
2013,4,Good app and easy to use. Too bad it doesn't do package deals or cruise searches.
2013,5,"This app allows you to quickly view multiple flight options and filter the flights by price, arrival time and more. And it does it all so quickly and easily."
2013,5,"Its a brilliant app, it even has preferences for different currencies and very easy to find many flights from cheapest to higher priced ones. I recommend this app for sure. Very convenient and helpful. Plus it's easy to use !"
2013,5,When making connections kayak has the most current and accurate flight status and gate information. I fly over 130k mi per year and use this app on every trip. Frequent fliers best friend.
2013,3,"It seems whenever I scroll before the data is loaded, even to unlock my screen, the data false to load fully. I dropped this.app down to one star"
2013,3,I'm not entirely sure that it is always accurate. Sometimes you can do the same search within thirty seconds of each other and get different prices.
2013,5,Contacted kayak who responded to these issues and the app now works perfect with my galaxy note 2. Well done Kayak and thanks.
2013,5,"I love it, it's the only search engine I use to find flights. I always find the cheapest prices here."
2013,5,Best flight tracker app in the market. Perfect design and always exact time and location provided. Thanks a million
2013,5,"Great options for finding a cheap flight even though sometimes it's possible to find cheaper ones at the competition.  Still,  it's  no.  1"
2013,5,"Superb app, very smart interface. The filter functions in flight search make it a cake walk to search gor flights."
2013,5,Great travel search engine.  Use it for small or large trips near and far.  I like the text alerts  for price changes when planning ahead.
2013,5,"This app is the best travel app I have ever used. I can get the best prices on flights transportation and hotels. I travel out of state at least 10 times a year, and all of my travel preparations are checked through this app. Not to mention purchaced with this app."
2013,5,"User friendly, great for expert travellers or novice like myself. I think I'm going to start flying more often!"
2013,5,"This app works great, it's very fast and easy to use. It's a must have for everyone."
2013,4,So finds flights great but falls on face and fails to book always gets hung up on something... shame so close to being great.
2013,3,Not nearly as good as ios version. Is only being able to use it when there is wifi an option or just forced?
2013,5,"This is an ingenious app for finding the best deals, whether that means ""cheapest"" or ""fastest"" or ""which carrier?""."
2013,5,Works every time recommend.
2013,5,The best app for searching travel period. So many options to get what you want.
2013,5,I love the layout and the ease of use. It's very user friendly and easy to navigate.
2013,4,The hugely informative fare confidence trending present in the web app is missing here. Please add it to get my 5 stars!
2013,4,Easy to use. Great resource for when I travel. I use My Trips to manage all of my travel arrangements even if booked through another site.
2013,4,"Excellent travel app, but it would be nice if the filters could be set as defaults for ongoing searches, not just at each search, and a 'SAVE' feature would also be more helpful than having to email search results to yourself."
2013,5,Very much User Friendly Prices similar to others Text color of prices need to be more clear Maps in mobile version very slow.
2013,4,Güzel ancak skyscanner uygulaması ve bunun arasındaki aynı seferin fiyat farkları bazen 2-3 katı farkediyor.  Ara yüzü de skyscanner'e göre daha karışık. Sadelestirilse iyi olur.
2013,5,"Very thorough and prices are all up-front, no hidden costs. It is my go to travel site and I travel a lot."
2013,5,"I like this app, used it on my  computer & it's really good to use on my phone! Download now it's Great!"
2013,5,I will always check kayak....they seem to beat out their competitors!
2013,5,I really like that its easy to look at recent searches.  Makes it easy to quickly check a bunch of options.
2013,5,"Very precise search bar, great specifications and amazing price suggestions. Marvelous organization of the app, completely recommend to those in the need to make constant trips or just about anyone decided to find convenient prices and great service"
2013,5,Works great. Helps find me flights easily.
2013,1,Found this app to be flawed..showed flights arriving next day when they didn't and prices horribly wrong. Un installed
2013,5,Awesome app! Simple jet comes with a lot of features! (Nexus7)
2013,4,But missing a few user friendly features. But I love the site and service.

2013,5,Kayak has the best deals on rental cars! I love this app!

2013,4,"Well it's. Free in here, insted of the apple store is 0.99$... thank you google😃"
2013,3,Now that it doesn't crash while searching I can give it a better rating than before.
2013,4,It's user friendly and quick!
2013,4,So far it works great. Easy to use on my mobile.
2013,3,The goal of kayak is to compare the cheapest prices and variations of flights. The mobile app desperately needs a flexible date search feature!
2013,5,"Very great application for travellers and business ppls., they can entire infos wherever they are.i can give more than5 star rating , but there is no stars:)"
2013,1,Will not let me search any flights because of connection error. Please fix LG G2 4.2.2

2013,5,Works well. Can't think of anything    to complain about.
2013,5,"Very easy to use UI, FINDS QUICK results."
2013,5,Does give best rates though sometimes cheapest fares can only be purchased through the kayak website which has VERY limited payment methods.
2013,5,Definitely one of those apps you want at your finger tips. Easy to use.
2013,1,The app does not fit my HTC one screen therefore I only see parts of it and am not able to use properly unfortunately.
2013,4,Very easy to use loaded with features.
2013,5,"It's easy to use. Not complicated, and booking flights are very simple!!! I would recommend to anyone."

2013,1,"Tied to log into My Trips? Now crashes constantly. Tried clear cache and reinstall, same problem. Don't bother sending reports - nobody cares. One of the best apps is now USELESS.  Update 31 August - New update still crashes. Amateur. Uninstalled."
2013,5,Kayak app is a great software to plan a travel. It make possible compare price of flys and hotels. I've never had problems about security. Price alert keep me update about promotions and good prices. It's very easy to use. It's the best traveler app that I ever had. I recommend.
2013,1,Send emails to guests without owners permission! Read calendar events including confidential information! Thanks but no thanks.
2013,3,"Used to be very reliable, but  recently started behaving unpredictably. Flight information gets wrongly populated or sometimes with inaccurate data."
2013,5,"Fast, easy and user friendly. I use of every time I need to find a flight at the best price."
2013,2,"On my galaxy need nexus. It doesn't finish searching and sometimes it tells me it doesn't have connection, although I have 4g..."
2013,4,This is a five star app.  Four stars is simply my way of motivating the team to do even better! KUTGW.
2013,5,I have tried so many travel apps already and this by far is the best. Always gives me the cheapest options if them all...
2013,5,Great app. Simple and easy to shop for deals. You can play around with the dates and other options without crashing.
2013,2,"When u click on something,  it doesn't wrk.  Id like alllll airlines to compare as well like Southwest. ..."
2013,5,I really appropriate all the work done by Kayak for such amazing tool.  I always use it to compare prices for my holiday and choose the best deal.
2013,5,I travel almost 2 to 3 times a week and between different countries.  Gives me very good rates on flights and hotels.   K
2013,4,Really good and useful app for all your travel planning. Use it regularly. It works!!
2013,1,After putting in the flight details one way it's not allowing to update the return flight. Poor
2013,5,"Almost the perfect app. Very simple to use, gives quick and consistent results.. Does everything it needs to and does it well."
2013,4,This app its amazing this is where u should get ur flight tickets i really will recommend it but my phone wnt let me reserved them so i logg in to my computer besides that its amazing
2013,4,It helps me compare the prices faster and more effectively than going to individual travel sites and I have not even fully utilize the app yet.
2013,5,Keeps all travel info in one convenient place. Nice interface.
2013,5,Have always used Kayak. Never lets me down. Can always find my flights for awesome prices.
2013,5,I like it. Even though there are more information about hotels in other applications. i hope it will be improved.
2013,2,Crashes on my sgs3 every time it's minimized and then opened some time later. Otherwise love this app.
2013,1,"It used to be wonderful app, but now it is crashing non stop..."
2013,4,After entering info you Catherine your searches. . . This is great!
2013,5,Excellent application... A must have works flawlessly
2013,5,Functional and effective. I could not be happier.
2013,5,I like it. Works as it should!
2013,4,Like this app it is a greate place to plan ur trip or to get preaty estimate of how much it will cost you	Great app
2013,4,"Seems pretty good so far, i am going to be testing it out when i by my tickets to China."
2013,1,Even if I select exact dates it still only shows results from other dates.
2013,4,Use to be a pain and was difficult to use nowadays much simpler I enjoy it now.
2013,5,Sorting and filtering flights makes it really easy to pick up the most suitable business trip. Love the app.
2013,3,After last update this app has been constantly crashing especially when searching for flights
2013,1,Crashes every time on my toshiba thrive tablet
2013,5,I probably use this every week. It's just as fast as desktop and probably even easier to use.
2013,4,Great for multi-stop itineraries or saving money with a long layover
2013,3,"Good, perhaps need the MAP of flying plane online"
2013,5,"Fast, accurate, time saver. My new bff"
2013,5,"Well organized, easy to use. Highly recommended."
2013,4,Maybe a way to sort out amenities like if pets are allowed
2013,5,I use this app every time I travel..guarantee you find lowest price
2013,5,I haven't bought a ticket through it yet but for tracking flights its a good download.
2013,4,If it would let me see flights a year ahead
2013,5,My go-to app for hotel and flight searches.
2013,5,"If you like the website, you'll love the mobile app."

2013,5,"Gives you many options such as +/-1,2,3 days."
2013,3,Great travel planner.
2013,4,highly recommended
2013,5,Don't know how well it works because it locks up my Xoom. Have to reboot tablet if I load this crap software.
2013,1,"Update closes at login or trying to view trips,flights,etc."
2013,5,"Easy to use, fast, stable."
2013,5,"It is a good site, love it on my Android Sony Tablet"
2013,5,Look for all airlines at once.

2013,5,Use it all the time!
2013,5,yeaaah!!
2013,4,Buena app
2013,5,Woop
2013,1,I'll never understand why programmers remove useful features for no reason and replace it with a bunch of useless tools.  Update:  had to stop and restart app to bring flight tracking back.  2nd update:  It disappeared again.  Worthless.  Update 3: Back again but not tracking flights.  Still worthless.
2013,4,"Mostly use Kayak for MyTrips feature, which was great for a recent 3 week trip to France and Switzerland involving planes, trains, and multiple hotels. Always saw at a glance when/where we needed to be. App craps out upon opening regularly, so no 5th star tho."
2013,4,While booking  a flight if your phone adjusts orientation it takes you back to step 3 and you must restart the booking process again.  This is extremely annoying. Other than that enjoy this app very much.  Used to just use Orbitz until now.
2013,5,"Just used the My Trip feature to plan a road trip. And there's even an editable packing list.  Love it.  Only thing I wish is I could search a map to find my places. ""Attractions"".  Like roadtripper. But I know kayak's main purposes isn't for that so it's still 5 stars. Will be using this site to book all hotels we end up along the way."
2013,1,"Not buggy, but the fact that there aren't many ""next"" buttons makes every tweak to an itinerary a guessing game for how to proceed. This is one of the worst UI's from a major company I've  seen in awhile. I avoid this app when I can."
2013,2,"Trying to track flight info, its so slow the app is useless. Flight info changed and 45 min and counting. after everyone else has updated Other sites/apps), still waiting on Kayak. Not acceptable."
2013,5,"You can't go wrong with this. application as it takes you through a journey through a host of other travel agencies and comes up with a vast choice of flights, hotels and car rental service. In no time you would've bought a ticket, hired a vehicle and found a suitable hotel at your destination countries.  Kayak is simple the best."
2013,2,This comment is on flight tracker function  only 1. Arrivals Confused by carrier change. Search for the Air NZ flight from L.A. via Papeete to Auckland not shown. Had to search for secondary carrier.  2. Search results (on est. arrival time at AKL) show times in UTC not local time. Confusing!  3.Dates on search results are in mm/dd/yy format. Useless to most of the world. Please show month NAMES and full year YYYY 4.Flight graph avoids date line and goes wrong and long way around the world.
2013,3,Seems to just list everything rather based on actual search parameters e.g. Edinburgh-Cardiff starts with listing easyjet flights to Bristol?? In addition why display a Flybe flight for this route that takes 22 1/2hrs as its taking you from Edinburgh to Manchester to Belfast and then Cardiff. Not the kinda preferred option I would think. Other than that good app.
2013,5,I've always used the site as it gave me the best deals and gave me the option to open the search in other travel sites. But with this app I got even better deals weird... also the mobile format is clearer and easier to navigate I find.
2013,5,"Kayak is the best airfare website and app around. My favorite features are the airfare price notifier, packing lists and baggage fees. This app is so easy to navigate and has a lot to offer"
2013,5,"It was an excellent app unill the last update I adimit some great features were added,but Why would any Traveling app remove the FLIGHT TRACKING feature?bring it back please.i dont like to download to many apps All-in-one apps are my best !!This app deserve a 5 Stars but now without the Tracking...its 3 !!  Aug. 7 ..Now..after i emailed them and they replayed to me regarding the flight tracking feature that they were having some bugs..do they canceled it till they fix it..and they did.Now its 5! "
2013,2,The interface is scaled back and the filters don't always work. Looked for flights on a specific date then opened up +1 day. Then i could not go back to exact date searches.
2013,4,"Really well done app. Missing a few features of the web page, but overall, an excellent copy of an excellent site. If only you could search Southwest!!"
2013,4,easy to use but I wish I could have up different options all at once instead of taking notes and going back to the start. kayak as a whole needs more air asia flights!
2013,1,6 months later the results are still the same - this app cannot complete a search without an error. It hangs at 99% done and I have all the updates installed.
2013,4,What in the heck? Why did they take away the flight tracker? I use to use this app all the time for work. Now it's just a waste of space.  edited: thanks for fixing this!
2013,4,"Nice and useful.  But a bit confusing because apps for Apple and Android devices have different features.  Just give all of us, all the features!"
2013,5,"It works quick and sooo easy. Great interface, very straight forward, no guesswork. Your ads are so stupid I'm almost embarrassed for people to know I use the app."
2013,1,"Sux...ZERO STARS......put in my origin and destination, made sure search nearby airports was NOT to be used, it not only included other airports, it did NOT even show the airport I requested, and better yet, it had me leave from San Antonio, and return to KILLEEN??? How do I get my car from the first airport, upon returning? Those airports are over 150 miles apart! USELESS!"
2013,1,"You can only search and book flights for up to 6 adults. Cannot include children anywhere. Of you're running a company, this may be good for you. As for a family with kids, forget about it."
2013,5,"Had an issue with the new permissions asked for in the previous release, talked with their app team, and they explained what the permissions were for and assured me they'd update the description in the next release.  That has now occurred, and u appreciate the effort."
2013,4,Galaxy note II.. Itis good application but one thing in hotel locations. I can't use navigation in google maps.!
2013,4,Super handy to check on flight info on the go. I rarely look elsewhere for flights. Could be improved by adding the options you have online to the search tho.
2013,4,This is a complete app with all the features you look for in a travel app. Reason why this gets 4 stars is because the UI is very outdated. It needs a compete UI makeover.
2013,5,Doesn't have the price matrix like the regular site. But then again it never works that well to begin with. Otherwise a great app. Easy to use
2013,2,"The first is delta link does not work. Second when I tried to use my card, the exp. Date could not be typed in."
2013,5,I love all of the filter options. It saves me so much time not having to look through a list of flights that wouldn't work.
2013,4,"Great app. Just minor issues if there is WiFi network Access and no Internet, it deletes the data it synced before. Else, its Great!"
2013,5,Alert and notification is great when traveling. Also very good at keeping my itinerary in a single place. Airline contact info. Is a handy feature in emergencies.
2013,4,"Extremely useful app! Great to browse through for general use. Would be useful if I could be more specific. I.e. on the hotels I should be able to choose if I want b&b, romantic etc. Other than that no complaints"
2013,5,"Exactly what you want in a travel app. I can compare prices and book all from my phone. Excited to use the agenda features, etc when it gets closer to travel time."
2013,4,"This  app is beautiful, functional, and easy to use. However, if you use the website frequently you may be frustrated with how much less intuitive the app is at times. Still a must have"
2013,4,"I wish it would save my most commonly set filters (e.g., non stops only) for all searches.  If it can, where do I find the instructions?"
2013,3,Limited information. I have been looking for multiple  flights from  departure and it brings up flights from another airport going to another airport point I'm trying to find bwi to lhr & bwi to Chicago O'Hare it pulls up mainly flights from iad to lhr or dca to milwaukee I'm certain the bwi even has direct flights to lhr and Chicago O'Hare or definitely through code share.
2013,5,"Compact, air ticket, best deal, cruse, hotel, cars rental, airline phone list, never crash, never frozen and the best at all and no less a EXIT BOTTON."
2013,4,"I love Kayak. It makes it very easy to search on the go!  You can access previous searches, create alerts and its easy to use."
2013,5,"I love this app. I practically book all my rooms and flights using kayak, save tons of cash, and can email the thing so it has my itineraries in one place. Other trip booking sites/apps are a total head injury."
2013,4,"Really handy app allowing you to shop for flights and hotels, and put all the bits into a clear itinerary, even if they were not booked through Kayak. Performance over slow connection tends to be a bit poor."
2013,5,"Planning honeymoon with my fiance. Kayak is really convenient because you can compare different travel agencies, airlines, hotels, and car rental companies with out having to go to all their individual websites. The customer reviews come from trip advisor."
2013,5,"With todays flight itinerary issues and worn down broken planes, I can always trust KAYAK to give me good rates with good safe companies. This app is soo easy to use it makes traveling that much easier. I wish all apps were this easy."
2013,5,It's an excellent App! I checked a particular flight on two other flight tracking Apps besides KAYAK & found that info re flight was highly updated only on KAYAK. This is amazing due to the fact that the flight was operating in Indian region where information re the exact status of flights is usually difficult to obtain. Keep it up KAYAK!
2013,5,"I love being able to compare the prices of different airports so easily. Search one, search the next, compare the prices. If my mother hadn't suggested I look at other ones,I would have spent $50 more for a round trip ticket."
2013,4,We've been using kayak for years and have referred them to many friends and family! The app makes it that much easier to plan on the go!
2013,5,Best travel app ever. Includes cool extras such as maps and to do lists. 100% recommended
2013,3,"Gives the information you need, but far not as flexible and user friendly as the online version. I miss the calendar overview of prices the most."
2013,5,"One of the best app on my phone, though i am not a frequent flyer i was planning a trip to thailand and this app made it so easier for me. Every indiviual should have this app installed."
2013,2,Tracking emails doesn't seem to work unless you go in and search. Then you get an alert or email. It seems pointless you have to go in run your search and then get the alert.
2013,5,I do a lot of traveling for both business and pleasure so I just love having all the great deals on airfare right @ my fingertips... it's totally awesome!!!
2013,5,This is a time and money saver machine. Clean theme/setup and simple design gets us really fast through the searching or booking process. Great app.
2013,3,"car rentals only have major companies, hertz and two others... also for flights you're better off using Skyscanner."
2013,5,"Saves info when you move from one part of the app to another. search for trips with multiple legs on it. Set filters by price, airline, stops, etc. this app is fully decked"
2013,5,A handy and easy to use software. Provides easy solution to multiple travelling requirements economically and comfortably.A must try software.	I hope it remains upto date in the times to come.Well done. Keep it up.
2013,5,This is sooooo much better than the expedia app. I can do multi city search and booking plus a lot more. It's just like being on my pc.
2013,5,This is as easy to use as their Web site.  It's refreshing to find a mobile app as functional as the desktop interface.
2013,1,Just booked holiday in Sept 2014 but the calendar doesn't go that far! Uninstalled.
2013,5,"I found my hotel and flight for my upcoming honeymoon using Kayak. This app is wonderful. Very fast, accurate, and easy to navigate. Definitely made me consider using Kayak for all my travel needs in the future"
2013,3,Nice UI but very expensive content. I cant found any flight from BTS when ryanair do.
2013,5,"This is a simple and well built app. The app is a mini version of the website, yet it has the bells and whistles any traveler needs."
2013,5,"Lightyears better than other booking apps, has many awesome features making it very convenient to use from the phone, on the go."
2013,4,User friendly. Easy to compare the fare btwn different airlines. Good job!
2013,5,Love that I get alerts from KAYAK about plane delays and such before they announce it over the intercom. App works well and easy to use.
2013,4,but the schedule for plane departure and landing are still not available. but really nice concept.
2013,4,"This app really does it all.In a world where time is money, having Kayak on my phone is a good thing."
2013,4,Please come out for a fix for this version! When updated it derserves a five star.
2013,4,Accurate.  Lots of helpful notes in one place. Most categories are customizable.
2013,5,"Excellent website, always gives the most options for planning my trips."
2013,5,"Always the best prices, no fees. App works great, just like the full website."
2013,2,Able to see up to date price information. Keep up the good work!
2013,5,Good interface.  Easy to use. Accurate info. Best app for airfares and travel planning.
2013,2,Takes long time to finish searching flight and stuck at 99% for several minutes before it can show all results. And the price are usually more expensive than searching on the website
2013,5,"I alaways check KAYAK before I check anything else. Been doing that since I started using it in FEB. So far, it hasnt failed me. ;-)"
2013,4,"Love having a summary of all upcoming flights & to 'share' them with the peeps who deliver & collect me from the airports. Great work, Kayak!"
2013,5,Even when I'm stuck on the train headed to work again I can just check to see if today is the day I should call in sick and take off to the Bahamas. That day is coming. I know it is.
2013,5,I use Kayak all the time for travel planning. I really like the daily alerts for flight prices.
2013,5,Even better than many websites! The option for search your history is very useful
2013,5,Couldn't ask for much more. Works great and is easy to use.
2013,4,It's very helpful and easy to use. Only concern is that I have found cheaper prices on the main kayak website when using both of them.
2013,5,"Never crashes, filtering is a breeze, and navigation is a piece of cake.  What's not to like?"
2013,5,Functions very well and is easy to use. There are lots of options to customize your airfare search.
2013,4,We always use Kayak to find travel deals. Having the app is handy.
2013,3,Although when the search its arriving at 98% it shows you the lowest prices but then it hits 100% and they arent anywere to be seen
2013,4,"The app works well, but it lacks some of the more rapid filtering functions that exist on the website, such as selecting nonstop flights in one click/tap."
2013,5,Took me but a moment to figure out fare alerts.  Love the nearby cities and +/- date searches.
2013,5,Kayak is one of the best travel search services. This app works smoothly and does the job.
2013,5,Like the website itself this app is simple and works. Everything at your finger tips
2013,5,"Love it! The price alert tool is the best thing, I use it all the time"
2013,5,Very helpful
2013,4,"Great, quick app. I still have to figure out how to see how the rates change by calendar date."
2013,5,Great app. I was able to find a 'hidden' fare for a recent trip to NC from Hawaii that saved me over $300 vs booking directly on any airline site.
2013,4,"Work fadt and a lot of options to choose from, also the flights fallo up is a good feature."
2013,5,Easy to use. Best deals. Never crashes.
2013,5,Its light weight and quick. Faster on my phone than on my computer
2013,4,Need develop update hotel prices some hotels call for the price s  Thank you
2013,4,Love the my trip feature.  I can see all my travel itineraries in one place.
2013,5,Good for flights and can also search for b class flights but should improve a bit like Skyscanner with flexible dates and destinations. Also in a city with more then one airport it should let you search any airport in that city.
2013,4,Works well for the limited usage I require--- mostly checking flight status.	Good basics.
2013,5,I use it to find and book overseas flight ticket. You can find a suitable time and cheap price in the meantime.
2013,1,Whenever i search for flights or do anything it says oops sorry no network available even though i am connected to wifi. Fix this
2013,5,"Great app for finding flight costs, options, convenient to use!"
2013,5,Kayak is superb can even track your flight while in the air!! Im 25 minutes early and kayak was right.  Great app.
2013,5,This app is great with my Samsung Note 2. They are cheaper than priceline and Travelocity
2013,5,This app works awesome. Great filter features.
2014,4,I enjoyed using Kayak. Nice UI and sure information.
2013,1,No reliable and not accurate.  Crash all the time!
2013,5,"I like the deals you can get from Kayak searching all the sites, but this app is even better because you don't get all the pop unders that you would from using the website."
2013,5,I used Kayak extensively.  I found it easy to use. It empowers customers by being well-informed.
2013,5,Great app. Saved money and easy to use. Love to find tickets cheap. Would gladly pay for this app.
2013,5,"Been using this for almost 10 years, and I still think it's the best app for great fares (air, hotel, car rentals etc...)"
2013,5,Seems to be a good app. Gives me all the cheapest deals and is real easy to use
2013,1,Can't filer specific airports. Resets to show all after trying to filter. Htc sensation 4g. Uninstalling.
2013,3,Most of the search filters on the website are not available on the app.   C.
2013,5,"Flights, hotels, cars, all in one easy to use and filter app. The best I've used. Highly recommend."
2013,4,Like the website? This is a great little companion. Must have on travels
2013,5,"I love this, it shows you everything available for the dates you choose in one place. Very helpful app!"
2013,5,It is an all encompassing app. Simply the best. My 5 stars for it no doubt.
2013,1,I have a strong wifi connection and the search feature is not working!!!
2013,3,"Couldn't find airport at Havana, Cuba. Skyscanner did. Uninstalled."
2013,5,Thank you for bringing back the Flight Tracker!
2013,4,I always start with Kayak before going anywhere else. It would be 5 stars if I could pick a default airport to fly from.
2013,5,Easy and fast way to search for travel info. Packing lists are a nice touch. Overall great app!
2013,5,Must app for all android users. Very fast and easy
2013,4,"This site has everything, it gives comparative prices and has a multi destination option that is great if your looking at holidays or stopovers"
2013,5,Its working nicely espically after update with flight tracker now. Thanks
2013,5,I have actually compared the information Kayak provides and verified it. I trust Kayak so I'll book with Kayak even if it costs a few more dollars.
2013,5,This application has everything you could possibly want when searching for flights to book. A must have.
2013,5,Easy way to find great deals. Highly recommended
2013,4,Not bad. Too bad you can't see if the tickets will be cheaper if bought later on like on the full website
2013,5,All in 1 for traveling.  Like the comparison w flights.  But wish theyd alert me
2013,5,The only website I go for the lowest prices. Love Kayak!
2013,5,"Great, does the job! Just wish search filters could be saved so that we wouldn't have to change them for every search"
2013,5,Works better than the other apps. RECOMANDED!
2013,5,Works like a charm! :)

2013,5,Useful tool for travelers around the world
2013,5,I'm glad I got it. Seems to work very well!
2013,4,Changing how exact your search is doesn't take effect.

2013,4,"I love kayak search - works very quickly and covers nearly all the airlines and other options such as ebookers.  The app sometimes gets to 99% then fails to show the final list of options, for no clear reason.  This has happened on both my transformer prime and my nexus 4.  It doesn't happen much, but hence the 4 stars online."
2013,1,App crashed 3x on one search.  Filters reset yet my search will only show one airline.  There are many airlines servicing my airport.  I can use a different service and get ALL airlines and see different rates.  Prior version was beautiful and easy to use.  This one is terrible and provides inadequate information.  Needs some serious work!
2013,1,"This app has been phenomenal all the way up until the most recent update. Since then, the app crashes constantly, arrival and departure times are all wrong in flight tracker, and the flight tracker option won't even appear on the home screen 75 percent of the time. FIX IT!"
2013,4,"App makes it easy to find hotel, cars and flights. Especially when your plans change.  You can also track your flights and get delay alerts.  One minor gripe, since the last update, all AA flight times at least are shown in ZULU time, even if it says CDT or EDT. I think this a bug."
2013,4,"Works very close to 100% for US domestic flights, will occasionally show outdated flights on international travel.  Doesn't always capture all budget airlines on foreign to foreign flights in the EU and elsewhere.  Cars feature also very good, but you can usually do slightly better on Priceline or Hotwire."
2013,1,Dont waste your time. This app is worthless junk on the galaxy s4. Everything I try and this app still says please try again later. Unable to connect to the internet.  Have tried multiple WiFi connections.  4G connection and still won't work.  Uninstalling now!
2013,2,"Update 2 July 13: a recent update broke flight tracker. Don't use it to plan your arrival at the gate - times are always GMT, apparently.   Love the ability to forward email confirmation from airline to kayak and get flight status."
2013,1,"Used to be a great app. Now it seems pretty worthless. Flight tracker shows wrong departure/arrival times, hotels never show available or with prices so I have to go to the hotel websites directly. Too much trouble for my busy travel schefule  I use it almost every day. Checking prices, getting flight status, navigating airports on a long layover... it helps with it all!"
2013,3,"This is one of my favorite apps, hands down. Simple, small footprint, doesn't aggressively run in the background, a very excellent app. Latest update removed flight tracker from main selection menu, which I rely on constantly. Until fix this, I will keep review at 50%. Once fixed, I will rate 100%."
2013,3,"Why would you remove the flight tracker? It was one of the most useful items on the app. Everything else still works but the one time I'm traveling short notoce and to look for the tracker its gone, terrible executive decision.  Now I have to go find another app.....smh"
2013,4,Handy tool for checking flights and keeping track of your trip details. Not really much different from the website but handier.	Finally app2sd arrived! Handy app for simple searches or if not able to use/view full featured web service.
2013,3,"Used to be a fantastic app, and it's free. But the latest update took away Flight Tracker. Why on earth would you take away one of *the* most valuable features?"
2013,3,"Searching with the app is better as the desktop website, that said much. However, the booking process is cumbersome at best! You book a flight, receive a ""booking in processing"" then WAIT, wait. After receiving an confirmation email with ""record location code"", ticket number, you still unsure the ticket is confirmed or not! Days after, they sent an email said I should call them back (not toll-free!) and because I am on vacation and not check all day for their email, they canceled my booking!!"
2013,1,"Tried searching for flighted for my home airport ... Worked fine in past. Now, not only does it return results for the wrong departure airport ... I.e., doesn't list my home airport ... But it doesn't get the destination airport right now either ... Eg., tried searching for San Jose, can, but it keeps returning results for San Francisco.  Consider this app uninstalled."
2013,5,"Kayak brings a lot of useful data on hotels, air fare and rental cars right to your fingertips.    I know when I use Kayak, I am always seeing the real price and availability of these services, not teaser prices which cannot be found when you seek to book them."
2013,3,"I get flight search results that are reported as departing and leaving on different days, which cannot be.  Example: MUC to IAS and back, with a stopover in VIE.  App says the one hour flight from VIE to MUC spans a whole day.  Usability is good, but reliability is critical."
2013,2,"Before the last update 5 stars.  Now 3 stars.  All flights in flight tracker are showing incorrect departure and arrival times, despite them being correct in my trips.  Fix that and it's back to 5 stars."
2013,2,Doing well. Some reason not getting notifications till I lunch app and won't let me pick exact days of travel for fare alerts. Could use more adjustments for flexible travel days/hours especially for multicity travel.
2013,5,"I always know I'm finding the best deal on a flight, and have to most options of exactly when I want to fly (using multiple airlines) when I use kayak. Plus the app is really simple to use."
2013,2,"I use the map for hotels in an area but when I select the hotel its address places it in a different area that I do not want. This happens multiple times, so I cannot trust this app. Uninstalled."
2013,5,"Best prices hands down. App works very well, no hiccups and it's very easy to navigate through. This company puts in a lot of time and effort to take care of it's customers. Must have app for your Android."
2013,4,Apps is good but I think the need to do good job of sticking with predicted fare. I mean it says that the price is good for 5 hrs ago but after searching the changes drastically. I can understand this if price was couple of days older but 5 to 6 hrs does not make sense.
2013,4,"Convenient options to help you find a hotel, flight, for your trip. Would be better with some easier search options when you have a few hotels in particular you want to compare. Otherwise easy to use and fast."
2013,5,"Needs option to use Google Maps though.  Not a fan of Bing. UPDATE : got a response from customer support about this immediately.  No Google Maps but appreciate the quick response,  bumping this up to 5 stars."
2013,1,"The app and the computer yield different results and the app did not allow me to book the trip. I wasted time filling it out on the phone because the prices where better, but then when you went to complete and book it would not process."
2013,1,Did you really remove the flight tracker option the day before my flight?? It was the only option I used - it actually gave important information. I'm upset and will be uninstalling.
2013,5,"My goto app when planning a trip. Doesn't include all airlines, use the Trip Alert feature alot. Just started storing my trip itinerary on it, and then emailing it to friends to join the road trip."
2013,2,"All it says anymore is there are no hotels available,  everywhere,  all the time. This used to be a great app, but not since tge last update :("
2013,5,This app saved me lots of money through its convient and thoughtful functions.  I would have spent much more time looking for cheap air fare some where else.
2013,2,"I was not allowed to purchase the flight I needed. I just kept getting a message stating it was unavailable, but when I redid the search, the flight still appeared with ample seating. Very annoying."
2013,3,"The option to track a flight by flight number, route, etc. was taken away in the latest update. Please re-enable this."
2013,5,Well! I like it a lot. I have a lot of Apps I Love and still don't rate. This one has earned all 5 stars.
2013,5,"does what I set out to do. great search and filter options, and I can save trips! use this app every time I fly."
2013,3,I want to be able to filter flights on search like choosing no stops. For a flight search with 2 possible flights I hsd to wait for 2235 to load before I could filter them. Time consuming when not on wireless.
2013,5,Awesome travel app. It knows flight delays and gate changes before the airline does. The my trips feature is great. It even recognizes itineraries in other languages.
2013,4,Love all the features in this App. Personalized trip info...flight tracking...airport terminal maps.. and of course airfare alerts!!! What a great travel tool!!!
2013,4,They do a good job of fitting lots of info into small space on the phone.  I'd like to see some more of.the desktop features put into this app.
2013,5,"Awesome how you can easily keep track of your itinerary. Very easy to search flights and hotels, but even if you want to go direct to an airline, a hotel or a restaurant reservation, you can just send kyak a quick email and they will post to your My Trips. Love the reminders too!"
2013,4,Kayak seems to have the best prices and the easiest to use app. I check all over for the cheapest flights and I always find my way back to Kayak.
2013,1,Latest update cannot make internet connection. Failed for me an Galaxy Nexus and Xoom.  On Xoom it forces a reboot. It appears only hotel search is broke.
2013,5,"I'm android developer and in my opinion, this aplication is awesome!! It has a incredibly fast response time, even though the interface is intuitive and friendly.  This is awesome travel app!!!"
2013,5,Helped me find a cheap flight in no time after 18 years of being on a plane!! Getting ready to book a flight now to New York in September!!! Thanks Kayak!
2013,5,"Easy to search for the same flight over and over, and comparing this app to other flight searches, this one has the cheapest flights by FAR. Wont be leaving my phone anytime soon!"
2013,1,"Says internet problems and cannot find hotels. But kayak site works A+++ on my ipad, but mobile, not worth a hoot."
2013,1,Highly disappointed with its omission. It was the only option I often used on this app. It's useless for me now.
2013,5,"After installing kayak on my android phone , I find it so easy to get information I need just on a click as it operates and opens exceptionally fast embedded with a number of filters and searches one may need for  further  informations and advance searches .Thanks to the provider."
2013,1,"Installed it to do a car search from GRR to STL and it crashed on me like ten times, even after restarting my Nexus 10. Not very useful."
2013,5,Works great. No bugs I've experienced. Easy and quick to check flight prices daily! Filters are a great feature.
2013,4,I like the ease of use and the ability to search a flight within seconds.  Doesn't eat up too much space on my phone.
2013,3,"After the last update, the flight tracker tab disappeared which was the most useful aspect of the app for me. Previously a 5 star app, but this change limits the functionality for me."
2013,4,Kayak is my travel search engine. It displays quickly my travel choices fast and it is accurate. Fliters and page layout is easy to use
2013,4,"App is great, would give 5 stars if it would give the option to look up hotels that are near any address not just the city."
2013,5,"Coolest travel app ever! The functions, options and UI are amazing. Havent found a bug yet!"
2013,4,The alerts aren't very good though. I have to open the app to get them. I was hoping to get them throughout the day
2013,3,That was the single best feature of this app and now I can't find it. Please bring it back.
2013,5,I really like the way they can monitor the price is the flight amazing Philadelphia Los Vegas $226 round trip it was 27 hours ago and I missed it but if I got it wow seems so easy to put up lights from your phone that is  ridiculous
2013,5,Easy to use app and awesome prices! I am so glad I chose to download Kayak's app!
2013,5,App for those that don't do agents. Good app to build your own trip. A must-have app.
2013,5,"This app surprised me immensely when I first downloaded it. It has everything you need, even a price alert for when there is an offer on the trip you want to take. Easy for me to give this app 5 stars when it is so well made. Recommended."
2013,5,"I've used kayak for my last few trips, and I've loved how simple it makes planning my itinerary. And now with the mobile app, i can check flights quickly and daily."
2013,1,Everytime I try to book they then tell me that price is not available any longer and the current price is at least $500 more expensive. EVERY TIME
2013,5,"Much better than tripit and other travel apps.  KAYAK is able to read ALL kinds of itinerary, give you flight delay alerts (before it appears on the gate!) and much more."
2013,5,"I'm a frequent traveler; I've been using this app for over an year now. It's an amazing application to find a quick travel quote.... I call it ""travel power on my finger tip"""
2013,1,"Blows. Shows availability and you go to book and ""sorry no rooms available"".	Tried is 10 times jus to make sure the app blew by I left bad press!"
2013,5,If you can separate the round trip into two separate choices so I can travel at the desired hour & with an affordable price .... like expedia app. This app. Will be absolutely amazing.

2013,4,Very useful. Would like an option of hotels near airport please.
2013,5,Very intuitive interface.  So easy to search. Great job Kayak!
2013,5,Tried other apps they didn't support the files so I ended up adding stuff manually... This has taken everything I've thrown at it-all my travel stuff in one place is great!
2013,5,'Nuff said. Need I say more. Goes out there and scours the 'net for the best deals.  Lovin' it.....
2013,5,Best quick flight search tool for me. Love the filters and ease of use.
2013,5,Prices are usually the same as hotel offers or AAA rate. Flights can be pricey but I'm last min o booking.  No complaints.
2013,5,I have used it many times to find good flight options. It's very convenient to have kayak on my mobile.
2013,1,Flight tracker Time -7 hr offset after app update. Please correct. Thanks
2013,4,Compares prices to major competitors. Always get a deal.

2013,3,This app is one of my favorites. It works as advertised and is an excellent tool for gaining travel pricing info
2013,2,It keeps telling me that I have an issue with my connection but my phone is fine. All of my apps and Internet is working.

2013,4,Works great only problems is it crashes sometimes.. ..please fix
2013,4,"It doesn't suck. It performs as I desire, and until someone makes an app that will read my mind, it will be my travel app of choice."

2013,3,"With the update the flight track option is no longer available, please put it back, it was excellent!"

2013,1,Am I the only one that noticed the Flight Tracker is gone? That was the feature I used most on this app.

2013,3,"I have been using Kayak Pro for a long time, on many many trips and it has been a very helpful and useful app to have. I recently switched from iPhone to Android, and found the app to still be immensely useful on my trips- easily pulling up reservations to check in, and finding flight status (and sharing the status to others by email), and looking up flights and other travel deals. Furthermore, being able to simply forward the flight confirmation email to have Kayak automatically create an itinerary from it is brilliant!   However, I found it to not be as feature rich as the iPhone app. Some of the features I miss are: being able to reorder the home screen of the app (to maybe have ""My Trips"" and ""Flight Tracker"" at the top), ability to view the email that was forwarded to create the itinerary on ""My Trips"", and ability to order the airport amenities by Terminal. That being said, it is still an amazing app, and has been priceless to me during my travel."
2013,4,"The last time I reviewed this app I gave it 1 star for search, interface and bugs. WOW complete 180, nice interface, optimized for tablets running Jellybean no hangs, freezes or hickups. Nice turnaround for this app as a product. But...beware of the pricing for hotels and rent a cars! Do your homework, I found the same hotel room using identical searches on other apps and found my room saving $40 a night.  So let this app (others like it) be a guide for you not an end all final price. ( Call by phone after using this before booking, usualy you can get an extra % discounted...I do!)"
2013,4,"Recently took my first real vacation and had never flown or been to Seattle.  On a whim,  I downloaded a number of different apps and began my planning.  I deleted all but this one and seat guru. I researched and booked my 8 days for Seattle and the Olympic Peninsula. I stayed in 3 hotels, had a car and took care of my flight all from my phone! I liked that I could prepay more than half my trip. It made the cost easier to deal with. I definitely recommend this to others and plan to use again!!"
2013,1,"For such a great website, this app was worthless, and the mobile optimized site even worse. Search was limited, at best. Impossible to choose one flight leg. Basically, all of the features that make the website good, don't exist.  The mobile site was just as bad, but more frustrating because it at least showed some search options but none of them worked.  I literally could not have booked a flight if I wanted to."
2013,1,"I got this app for the flight tracker function which worked pretty good. Automatic updates are switched OFF on my phone but still kayak managed to remove the flight tracker function from the app. I find this disturbing and have therefor removed the app. If we can not trust apps (thus developers) to respect our settings then we are in trouble. Shame on you kayak, get out of my phone."
2013,2,The tablet version (on Samsung Tab 8.9) worked good until it goes through to Delta to make the purchase. It freezes on the Delta 'initializing' screen. Had to redo the order on a desktop. Made the app worthless unless just researching prices. Please fix. The layout is good though.
2013,3,No flexible date search! Not enough different airlines included in the search! Also when traveling using connection flights there is no option for the amount of time that you would like to spend at each destination before continuing a journey. Its more likely to find cheaper deals using some rival apps as there are more options with airlines you would like to use & a far wider date search for travel. These options need adding to allow us customers to find better deals than what's currently being generated.
2013,1,"after installing the latest update on my Nexus 4 the filters have stopped working. now when I'm searching for a flight I can't use any of the filters. I can go into the filters setup, but it doesn't affect my search results... I really hope the developer fixes this issue fast.	after installing the latest update on my Nexus 4 the filters have stopped working. now when I'm searching for a flight I can't use any of the filters. I can go into the filters setup, but it doesn't affect my search results... I really hope the developer fixes this issue fast."
2013,1,I think the new permissions over step commonsense boundaries.  You need to stay out of my personal stuff.  I think you are overstepping the boundaries of invasion of privacy.  We do not believe that you offer sufficient protection of our calendar and personal information an we MUST remove your app with deep regret.
2013,2,"I'm keeping my current version for as long as I can, because Kayak is so good for planning travel. The new permissions required are way too invasive. I'd at least like to have the developers explain why they need them, though it might not change my mind. Right now I'm in the market for another travel app."
2013,1,"This was one of my favorite apps and I used it often to plan trips.  With the most recent update, the app permissions were changed and now Kayak wants to access even my information that is flagged confidential.  Really?? I will give it one more update cycle and if this overly-intrusive permission requirement is still in place, Bye Bye Kayak.  On all my devices and platforms."
2013,4,"Very well organized and almost as good as the website. A must have if you travel frequently. Needs the website weekend search, and the post-search filter interface is a bit strange, but perfectly functional and very useful. Also I would love to be able to purchase tickets using my Google wallet, but I understand this is out of scope for Kayak unfortunately."
2013,1,"I've always loved kayak but when I read the updated settings for the latest upgrades it actually stated ""might read confidential information without user knowledge""... Are you serious and just hoping people won't read, or joking?  I hope the latter."
2013,1,"I will not update when they want to add permissions that are obviously malware-worthy. You have no right to send emails out from my address.  I was just about to give 5-stars for my great experience, but the new permissions are malicious, plain and simple. I'm now uninstalling."
2013,4,"I prefer the website better over the app! But only because you can search more than just a single category on the Web.  I was hoping to find the ""hotel+flight""  as an option. It's okay though :3"
2013,4,Love this app. I use it all the time to look up prices for hotels or flights. Only problem I see and also the reason I didn't give it five stars is the flexible feature doesn't show all the plus or minus and I have to do multiple searches. Still a great app.
2013,4,There are some features like setting an alert won't let me pick dates and multi city doesn't Work either. Businesses would like full featured apps that everything works on. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
2013,5,"This works great on both my Note 8 tablet and BB phone, all my trip details stored in one convenient place. No more printing of screeds of paper! Also a good search engine for flights, hotels, rental cars cars, and can book from within the app. Perfect :-)"
2013,5,"This is by far the easiest way to get great deals, smokes competitors like Orbitz (and even searches them, too!) This app streamlines travelling and is much easier than using a website, so I can search combinations of flight times and days much more quickly to find the best deals. No real complaints, less headaches and more travel"
2013,1,As of 7/11 the app required updating and had some new permissions. I noticed that it wanted permission to read my contacts and send email without my knowledge. If this is the way Kayak wants to do business I have to say goodbye.   I hate spammers especially one that wants to do it to my contacts probably in my name.  Shame on you!
2013,3,"Why does this suddenly need to make calls from my phone, modify my calendar, and send email without telling me?  Think I'll avoid this update on what's usually been an excellent tool."
2013,4,"Why does it need those two new permissions? Call numbers directly, access calendar events (confidential included), and email people? Please provide explanation in update log.  Update: they clarified the new permissions. I will give it a try."
2013,5,I use kayak to find the best deals and all of that but the trip feature is what I usually use it for. Send the receipt of your upcoming trip and it combines them all for you. This is my most used feature because I am not always using the app to purchase airfare my points and rewards could score for me. Additionally having the trip laid out in this format has been worth it.
2013,3,"They FINALLY removed 90% of the permissions they didnt need.  Now - caveat - once, they sent all my phone contacts spam invites via sms AND email! That is what the perms were 4 , but, as said, now removed! And, KAYAK, dont ever do that again - a warning from ""Red"", heed it."
2013,2,"While my daughter is sitting on the runway waiting for her plane to get in the air, kayak claims she has departed and will be arriving 40 minutes early.  Maybe this disinformation is from the airline, but don't offer a feature if you don't have the data to make it work."
2013,1,"I am NOT giving this app the ability to unlimited access to my calendar. This update wants permission to access my calendar (including private listings), the ability to invite guests without the host's knowledge, and the ability to add/delete events without the host's knowledge."
2013,3,"Used it just the once. Happy with the experience. However the ticket prices are shown in US $, but I need them in Indian Rupees. I will give it 5 stars if they made it country specific. Nonetheless, I still recommend it to every one because it covers practically every airline and flight route out there."
2013,4,Almost as good as the website which is THE BEST travel planning site out there. Use mytrips to sync with your calendar even if you don't book on the site. Only drawback with the app is that you can't opt for nearby airports otherwise 5 stars.
2013,1,"Kayak could conceivably add things to my calendar and I'd be okay with that. Modify, read private data and send emails without my knowledge? Not so much."
2013,1,"They removed the flight tracking feature, which was one of the main draws of this app for me. Without it, I will be uninstalling the program. I don't understand why they would take a flight tracking feature out of a flight tracking app!"
2013,1,"So it gives me a list of prices at all the sites, but the $ through Kayak is less so I click on that one.  Suddenly it prompts me that the $ has just gone up...miraculously to the exact $ that the others were showing it for.  Does anyone over the age of 12 actually fall for this?"
2013,3,Very easy to navigate and compare costs. Thank you for a job well done!!  *Revised* took away a couple stars after running my security scan...leaks personal info.
2013,1,"I discovered by accident that the app will quote HIGHER PRICES than the website. I looked at a car rental in the Web, then decided to put the exact same parameters in the app to check on it and got higher prices. Went back to the website and saw that prices are still the cheaper price I originally got. What's going on here??"
2013,5,"Found my flight status for deptr info. Baggage restrictions , car rates and booking.  All airlines phone contacts  Awesome app"
2013,4,4 out of 5 only because when you link to other travel sites it is much slower due to kayak parenting the site.  Other than that fantastic.  Great for multi stop flights.  Saved me a bundle due to the easy to read flight itenerary data.  Nice!
2013,3,The app itself works great. I use it for hotel searching and price on list never matches what shows after clicking the link. Always $10-$15 more than what is advertised.
2013,1,You don't need to make phone calls directly unless your app is a scam or a dialer replacement.  You should use the intent instead.  I cannot accept your app update permissions.
2013,4,Great app for planning trips. Gives you so many options and covers the 4 major travel sites. Give stars if I could book a car independently of my travel itinerary.
2013,4,"I use this app whenever the travel bug strikes. It's great to be able to get a quick sense for how much  my flights will cost me when I start talking trips with friends. The hotel and car stuff I've never touched, but the flights I use at least once a month"
2013,5,"such a solid app. never crashes. never slows down. never had a problem booking anything.  love that they've integrated the best parts of the site into one powerfully app. price alerts, price trends, easy navigation, flight status, and packing list? boom!  it does exactly what I need it to do when i need it to. ive booked a virgin america ticket on here after having problems with the ""mobile"" virgin website. same price less hassle."
2013,2,"Used to love this app. Used it all the time to track flights, but now... no flight tracker... no need to use this app or even keep it."
2013,4,"I mainly rely on Blackberry travel. For my android phone, I really like the way Kayak organizes the travel information. Will be five stars if it can automatically scan emails like blackberry travel does"
2013,4,"Easy to use, one stop shop. I always use kayak to compare prices. Plenty of filtering options. The only thing is, can't search for package deals on kayak."
2013,5,"Wonderfull love use it, always the best price ever. Easy to use , just your airport dates and where to go and find your vacation trip.	I use every time in my computer, and no in my phone  likes a lto"
2013,1,"I use to love this app however most recent update grants app to edit my calendar, send emails without my approval or knowlwdge and access to my personal information. Seesm excessive!"
2013,1,"The new update requires that I give Kayak unrestricted access to my calendar, including confidential items, without notifying me?  No thanks!"
2013,4,"This app is easy to navigate through & easy to understand. What I would like to see is more  filter options for hotels such as choosing the amenities I desire in a hotel. Overall, this is a very nice app."
2013,3,Better than the AMEX Mobile extend app.  Needs a calendar sync feature and a better flight info widget.  Add those and your golden...
2013,4,"I love kayak on all platforms,  but really need to include the option of searching for flights for children!! I travel several times a year with my 3 year old and can only use the website to find tickets."
2013,5,This app is an amazing tool when traveling and incredibly easy to use.  We were able to track the status of our flights and found out one had been delayed early enough to give us time to book a different flight.
2013,5,"It would be nice to be able to save trip ideas to continue searching for until you find the right deals.  Then transfer it to ""my trips"" to track."
2013,4,"Easy to use, has all the functions you need from the site (except the vacations page), relevant extras (like the packing list). There is a playfulness to the content of the app. Sometimes has search load errors, failed data connection? But otherwise, great app!"
2013,5,"Use on LG Revolution and Toshiba Thrive and flawless on both. Love the ""Search One And Done"", but really love the ""My Trip"" feature. Great app for either phone or tablet."
2013,1,"no explanation for over a month as to why the new permissions are required. didn't upgrade, now uninstall. i can recommend skyscanner as alternative, pretty awesome with widget."
2013,5,This is a great app. My wife and I use this app when we travel. You can email your itinerary and it will automatically add it to your trips. The flight traker is always up to date. There are many more features.
2013,5,I use Kayak to book trips but not always. I think the ability to email ANY itinerary or confirmation and have it appear in My Trips is the best! The mobile interface is also great. 5 big stars!
2013,5,Very nicely done app. Look for the filter menu on the left. It's easy to miss...but all options are there. I wish the price alert feature sent a daily email or a frequency selected by the user.
2013,5,It has a sleek appearance and so far I couldn't find better deals elsewhere. Very convenient for frequent travelers. Thank you and keep up the good work!
2013,4,Good App...seems accurate.  The only problem that I have is that the search result bar sometimes freezes at 99 percent and won't complete the search.  Other than that there is no problem.
2013,1,"Sorry, uninstalled. New update wants access to calendar, events, and ""personal confidential information."" You guys go too far."
2013,4,Really surprisingly sleek app and really easy to use. Don't understand why there are alk these ads for priceline etc. that show up in the results. Aren't you trying to get me to use your service? Why would you throw ads up in my face for other services?
2013,5,"i love this app, i travel alot so the itinerary feature is really useful for managing confirmation numbers and timings.  wish i could see the notes i add to the entries though! that would be really helpful."
2013,5,"Great app, faster than browser even. Like how Kayak works. Just wish it had vacation packages by destinations. Then it would be awesome."
2013,5,I was looking for a total price search and a comterble trip somewhere which isn't possible to do right but looked for feature reference. And the results were great no hassle good set up. Keep it up.
2013,4,It's helped me so much with looking for flights quickly. Instead of searching everywhere I can search there and it gives me the cheapest deals. I love it.
2013,2,"Prices listed for flights are not always the same after it is selected.  Found the flight I want for $119.  When I  clicked on it, the prices changed to $218.  Figure it out kayak.  I'm claiming false advertising."
2013,3,"This app makes it easy to access kayak, my favorite new travel-bookings service. But the app is dead slow. Please improve performance at the earliest."
2013,5,I love this app and use it anytime I travel. It's great to have all of my trip information in one place. The user interface is neat and easy to navigate. Definitely recommend.
2013,1,"Why new privileges (direct calls, sending emails without my knowledge...)?! Am I part of Spam bot network?! Stopped updating this app and I can erase it if devs will keep things this way."
2013,5,This this is a great mobile app. It never freezes up or has issues loading. It's also fast and convinient to be able to look up flights easily.
2013,3,This is a pretty good app. I wish there was the consistent ability to search +- a few days. On some searches I could and on some I couldn't
2013,5,I love how easy Kayak makes finding and following flight prices. With specifics like cost and duration of lay overs Kayak takes all the work out of looking for flights. I bet travel agent's  love Kayak too
2013,4,Everything works great. The one thing I wish they added would be a flex dates feature for flight search.
2013,5,"I've used Orbitz and Expedia apps, but Kayak has a quick, easy way to plug in your destination info, dates, etc.  It's just plain quick and offers options for other site comparisons which is a great added feature."
2013,4,"Stellar application with only two requests. I would like the currency converter to cache last known exchange rates for use offline. Second, I would like to save flight intineraries for viewing with my account on a laptop or desktop."
2013,5,"Quick Simple Accurate Fast, and great options.. I'm outta here now and a lot more often. See ya.. Thanks Kayak. 46.."
2013,2,"Found much better airfare on hotwire, hotels on priceline... I'm talking $450 round trip vs $225 on hotwire..  not worth keeping as I end up searching and buying on other sites instead"
2013,5,"Simple, clean and intuitive interface. Has options like multiple cities and many was to filter results. Price results have always been as low as other search engines."
2013,5,Especially useful for international flights and hotels. Sometimes can find very good deals. Price comparison among agents is excellent. 5 stars.
2013,1,"The loading bar gets all the way to the end and leaves a small sliver of progress to go....and hangs.  ""Please wait"""
2013,5,I use Kayak not only for my personal travel but also for family and friends. The status updates keep everyone on track without a need for multiple texts or calls.
2013,4,"Should include the option of adding ground transportation (bus numbers, times, etc) within a trip itinerary. I would rate it 5 stars otherwise."
2013,5,Very helpful app indeed. Premium service at an amazing price ($00). Thank you kayak for the great job.
2013,4,Has some minor nuances - such as it wouldnt import parts of my trip. Good thing it happens only some times. I would have given it 5 stars if it didn't have those quirks.
2013,3,"I wish I could add events and things in the My Trips section. Instead, I have to do it from the website. What if we suddenly make plans for something? It'd be great if I could add them to my overall trip itenerary."
2013,3,Don't like the new permissions. If I want to email someone I will do it myself. Good app but I will not update now.
2013,5,I was able to find the best deal between two departure locations. Cheaper than my usual sites I search for! New favorite application.
2013,5,This is a great app. It shows a lot of airlines with prices from low to high and shows options for car and hotel rentals. Very nice for quick reference and/or bookings.
2013,5,"Great, fast and easy to use. I use it all the time and great deals are found on last. Minute hotel. I love the multipule airport search option in any state"
2013,4,Seems quick n to the point. I love the fact it shows round trip I can't seem to get that info on other sites.
2013,5,It provides all I could ask for in flight search app. It's very fast and hasn't crashed on me at all. The information is well organized and I enjoy the fact that it can search adjustable flight dates. I definitely recommend it to any traveler or some fanatics who just wanna search travel information.
2013,5,"I like it cause it's easy to navigate through it. If it had the option to share flights or other things, I would have given it a solid 5 stars."
2013,4,The multi date and alternate city options are slightly clunky but functionality is overall good. No major loading problems.
2013,4,I'm very pleased with the performance of this app. It does a great job at delivering results. I would recommend it to my friends and family.
2013,1,"I'm not usually one to grouse about this sort of thing, but needing to read confidential information from my calendar? Really? Is this app now sponsored by the FBI?"
2013,5,I just get help from this app whenever I travel. Especially I recently found that the hotel function of this app is so powerful thanks always!!
2013,4,Very easy to use. Alerts are awesome if you want to find best prices. Kayak normally reflects best price. This app is also very good for booking all phases of your travel needs with the best possible prices.use it all of the time.
2013,5,"I love this app. Great UI. Quick, easy-to-use and as accurate as its desktop variant.   Only wish they'd stick with focusing on flights and not push hotels so much! :/"
2013,2,Good app but update requires too many permissions for just a travel app. I like kayak but not enough to give them access to all my data.
2013,4,"On my tablet it helps me compare and plan airline trips in advance. Having an account helps synch everything. There are still some LCC that are not covered in searches, though."
2013,5,"Kayak always delivers for finding the cheapest flights...click on the flexible dates for even cheaper options.of note, southwest is not included."
2013,4,"It's a really usefull app.  Not as convenient as the websit, but good in a pinch.  I wish it had more options."
2013,5,"Great app, the only travel one that actually works and does what its supposed to do. Very powerful filters and sorting, have no reason to use any other app to search travel."
2013,4,Compiles almost every available air rate.  It then directs you to the cheapest site to book the trip. Rarely does it miss one for cheaper.
2013,5,App has the same functions of the website but in a more concise and user-friendly fashion. I use it often as it works great!
2013,4,I have used kayak multiple times looking at European flight specifically. I find it easy to use and I have yet to find a better deal on other sites.
2013,4,This is the app I use most to find good ticket prices. It would be great if the upcoming weekends and other flexible date options available on desktop were on the mobile version.
2013,1,New permissions are ridiculous. No way can you send email to contacts without me knowing. That's malware!
2013,5,"Can pick date windows, nearby airports,  freedom to book directly.   Easy to filter out flying and arrival times,  airline choices. The only filter I would like to see is minimum / maximum connection time."
2013,5,The best part of search is... they display searches from other engines even if they are cheaper then kayak. Respect.  I tested with a few hotels in my place. I got the exact price. Others showed higher. Loving it
2013,5,"This gives me the choices of all airports, not just the top fifty. It doesn't limit me and even will give me the option to save by giving a couple days window for departure."
2013,5,Very easy to use. I love the way it shows all the flight info even from other sites so you dont have to go back and forth comparing prices. It even has a currency converter for international travel.
2013,4,Nothing spectacular. Gets the job done and the searches are easy enough. Wish they had access to more carriers but that's not always their fault
2013,1,"This app does not work on thw galaxy S4 !! U can install it, do ur search, nd everything just disappear. Very disappointed"
2013,5,Used it to purchace an airline ticket and the price I found was even lower from the laptop windows version. It did save me $$$$. 5 stars
2013,5,Accurate and easy to find information about flights and hotels. The trip tracking tools are excellent and work on most airports. Love this app!
2013,1,Read my calendar? Email my contacts without my knowledge? I don't need this app enough to allow that.
2013,4,"Intuitive UI, fully featured, fast - a solid app. But why does it freeze at 99% during a flight search?"
2013,5,Great app with native function. None of that web app crap. UI is very friendly and makes kayak content very accessible.
2013,1,The filter options for choosing a one stop flight and airline do not work. Also the search results in error message that internet is not connected
2013,5,Has been and always will be my first stop when planning travel. The app is quick and efficient. It does not have all the bells and whistles that the full site does but it does everything you need it to do on the go. Cannot recommend this enough.
2013,5,Love the app. Used it to book my Chicago trip and my Virginia trip. Works great. A must have if you travel.
2013,5,"This app is helpful b/c it compares flights, hotels, car rentals and ect. with other sites and will even transfer you to the other travel sites. In my opinion its better than Priceline."
2013,5,Managed to use it for a lot of my travels an always came up wiv top deals.  Could do far worse by not installing this app!!
2013,1,Don't like the new permissions. Please explain why you need to change my calendar without me knowing otherwise I won't update.
2013,5,"I am active duty military so I travel frequently and this app is the first stop I make. If they don't have the lowest price, they'll show you who does!! That tells me they're here for me, and not my money!"
2013,5,Flawless search engine. Makes my life a lot easier. Discovered this app 6 days; can't do without it anymore. Don't see the reason for any other app than this. Highly recommended.
2013,4,Since my last review this app has improved a lot. Great job. I can do international flights were as before I couldnt
2013,4,I find it very useful in locating flights easily. Interface is quite user friendly. Great app!
2013,5,"I use Kayak almost exclusively for all my air travel. Great flexibility, search history retention, price comparisons, and booking options."
2013,5,Best air travel tool out there. Been using it for years.
2013,4,"Browsing for ticks prices are easy! The only thing I don't like is when you go to purchase some tickets, it kicks you to the airline website and you have to search for the tickets again and then make to purchase."
2013,5,Excellent travel tool. Places everything that you need for travel in one convenient location.	Great App on my Galaxy S II
2013,5,Its amazing i don't need to go to every airline and check! Kayak is giving me all the details and best price. And to buy the tickey its so easy in kayak.
2013,5,"Can't say enough good about kayak. I wish there was better offline integration tho.. Like storing my mobile boarding pass, or even just allowing offline access to my flight info."
2013,5,A must have for every smart phone. Easy to navigate and always finds the best price!!
2013,4,I especially like the filters to help narrow down to your choices. App works as well as the website.
2013,5,5 stars because I've used this company from my PC and I always receive great results. I downloaded this app last year and it has come in very handy especially in the past few months. Great results. I look up information on this app a minimum of 5 times a month.
2013,5,Functional. Allows you to do everything you need to right frome your smart phone. Samsung Galaxy SII
2013,5,"I use the fare alerts with my flexible schedule and get cheap flights all over the world! The flight tracker, rental cars and easy filtering makes it the best travel app I have."
2013,5,"You guys did such a great job. I like the fact that I don't have to have several Windows open to compare flight prices; all in one window, one page, from plural carriers. Keep up the good job guys..."
2013,5,I use LG Thrill and this apps works awsome. I never got any problem using it and so easy to use and pretty fast search.
2013,5,I haven't used it very long but for  the moderate traveller it seems to have all the information in one place. Can't wait to travel!
2013,4,This app is absolutely amazing it has worked each time I compare prices for flights. Although I wish it showed me how much it would cost to have my dog come along.
2013,4,Would like to see flexible date search options.
2013,5,"This app is great, gives you great rate on different hotels. Also if your having trouble with the room preferences you can can the booking directly and talk customer service which is a GREAT help. AWESOME APP!"
2013,4,Best airfare price to Egypt from the USA outdoing all the rest. Haven't booked yet will update when I do.
2013,5,This is a great one-stop shop app for the traveler. There's even a packing checklist if you're a forgetful traveler like some of us.
2013,1,New update required to access personal information..  No explanation on the description why they need it.    So.. Unistalled.
2013,4,I love this because its so easy to use. And I can put the rates from high to low or go by ratings or whats closer to where I wanna be. FANTASTIC
2013,5,Keep all my travel arrangements in one place.  Share them with feeds.  Put them on my calendar.  Awesome
2013,5,Works really great to on Samsung Note 2. Easy to use to book your flight.
2013,1,I can see cheaper price in search but alert will still show high price .
2013,5,"Great flight ticket options. Even has my local airport! 5 stars, easy."
2013,3,I love this app but it would be nice if in the description it explained why so many permissions are necessary. Makes me wary of using this app.
2013,5,"Everything you need to research, book, and manage your travel in one user-friendly app."
2013,3,Make it easy to find flights. Wish can use billme later. Will be better.
2013,5,"Searching for travel related stuff has never been easier, or more powerful. Kayak rocks."
2013,5,Put in a couple of pieces of info and in no time you have multiple options displayed. You can even book through the app!
2013,5,Quick and effective. But the price alerts don't work effectively.. Especially if configured with a currency other than $.
2013,5,Round trip nonstop ORD to SFO 285.50.  Can't beat that.  Thank you KAYAK!
2013,5,Interface is very intuitive. Lots of features. I appreciate being able to use flexible dates.
2013,4,"Just a very slick user friendly app. All around good, probably the easiest to use."
2016,3,Great app for exploring and dreaming about travel. I use the flight search part and it is very well done.
2013,4,"Pretty good. Nice options, like car rentals"
2013,4,4 stars because there is no option to change currency. Prices only in US dollars.
2013,4,"When buying flight tickets,there's no kids option. Adults only. Please add."
2013,5,Very useful. Good interface. I love its ability to search travel in different departure and arrival.
2013,5,"Just like their website, probably even easier to use. Love kayak, best deals."
2013,3,East to use and I like the +/- 1 or 2 days. But it doesn't always show me all the flights between two destinations.
2013,4,"Fast and well-functioning, only you have to condider extra hidden costs showing up at the end of the process!"
2013,5,"Helps me find the best deals in a fast, smooth, and sleek interface. A must-have for the travel enthusiast."
2013,5,I find it easy to use. It lets me change and find different airports if I need to easily. I have not had any problems with it going down or anything its great

2013,5,I've always used kayak for all my travel needs.  I'm so glad that they have made this a pp as easy as the site.
2013,5,"This is by far the best app to use when travelling! I love the rates, I love my options, and I love how simple it is to use!"
2013,5,"I haven't had any problems with the app, everything appears to work as described and expected."
2013,5,"If you're gonna plan a vacation, a business meeting or something this app is helpful. It's got hotel comparisons and flight comparisons"
2013,5,As soon as I downloaded this app I made a quick search of flights to Mexico City and saw the cheapest prices I'd ever seen. Cop dem hoes and went to Mexico for 2 weeks. Ajua!!! VIVA MEXICO Y VIVA KAYAK !!! Now planning for my trip to Montreal. Tabernacle!!!
2013,5,"Use for checking flight prices. Great app, quick and easy to use and great prices. Time option for flights would be great."
2013,5,Smooth. Filters work very well. And surprisingly more options than Expedia!
2013,5,Accurate and fast way to book flight tickets. If you are traveling a lot this app is a must. Helps you to get cheapest tickets and compares the prices with other sites
2013,5,Great job on the travel deal alerts. Very complete and simple to use app that helps me plan easily.
2013,5,"Kayak is the gratest program ever,, i traveld with them many  times i trust them as i trust myself...  thank you very much kayak"
2013,5,The trip features and price alerts are invaluable. It is my stop when planning travel.
2013,5,Facile e veloce nell' utilizzo. Prezzi in euro. Mappe e filtri. Ha tutto. Stesso livello di trip advisor ma forse più immediato nell' utilizzo. Volendo trovare un piccolissimo difetto allora gli hotels dispongono di poche foto ma è un piccolissimo dettaglio
2013,5,"User friendly interface, and good prices. Almost like the app more than the desk top website."
2013,4,"App works great. Though, oddly, sometimes the price from the app is higher than the actual website."
2013,5,Flight tracker is as close to accurate as can be. Search works great.
2013,4,When will there be an update that allows android phones (not just tablets) see shared trips?
2013,5,Awesome app. Works really well. Love the ability to watch fairs by email
2013,1,Love this app. I use it all the time to quickly analyze what prices I should be paying for travel.
2013,5,"I can query my flight info quickly, and the results are always spot on. Thank you!"
2013,5,"An excellent app, but needs a good print out page. 24 her clock and UK date setting"
2013,5,Works real good.. This app helps a lot...Installing this one is a Must!!
2013,5,Good website. Accurate and numerous options. Easy to use. Deal finder !
2013,5,Rarely have issues. Clear interface. Up to date info. Great app
2013,5,"I use the widget to constantly check on flight prices, and buy when it is lo1west. Works great!"
2013,1,What's the point with the new permissions??? Why you need direct dial or sending sms/emails without my knowledge???  Uninstalling!!!
2013,4,Better functionality than most other search apps. Could use minor tweeks to location of various settings and a way to manually enter limits for refining searches.
2013,5,Excellent product. Definitely worth 5 stars. I tried two other apps like this and this was the only one that was able to import itenary in full.  I deleted the other two.
2013,5,I've been using this for about 5 years and always find great deals. highly recommend
2013,5,"Flex dates, simple and intuitive.  Such a good app and site."
2013,1,Adding the privacy violations in this release is ridiculous. Private information without permission = 1 star ap.

2013,5,Very easy to use. With round trip option! Absolutely love it!

2013,5,Great can find booked flights automatically.  I will use this app all the time.
2013,5,Lets you search through a lot of flights. Gives you an option for ±1 or 2 days which saves you a lot of searching time.
2013,2,"The problem of KAYAK is payment !  They canceled my booking because as they said no verviation from bank ! Although I had used it many times with popular websites like BOOKING, RENTALCAR, airlines ... etc!"
2013,4,really easy to use.  however can add advanced search function more complex trips.
2013,2,Worked fine before. Now it brings up different hotels when I click on somwthing in map view.
2013,3,"It's enough to organize a long trip, but you can't do nothing by the app, whatever you want to edit or create you need to go to the website."
2013,4,Very slow response when accessing my trips and flight status. Randomly force closes in background and appears to drain battery
2013,1,You seem to have a way too  lenient hand with using intrusive privacy permissions. I won't be updating anymore.
2013,4,"Does an excellent job of finding the lowest fares, I just wish it would track fare reductions like some other sites."
2013,5,"Works great, maybe a little less  flexible than matrix its, but ideal for fast checks"

2013,5,User friendly. Can set alerts for prices. Cool!
2013,4,A good travel search site/app. Came up with a lot of options to choose from with each search.
2013,5,This is a great application.  I love the feature that sends me daily emails on prices to locations I want to travel to this year.
2013,3,I tried several multiple city searches only a few came back with results. Most other apps worked better on this function.
2013,5,"Easy to use, lots of travel options. Great app."
2013,4,Perfect application for me to search for fly options. ..
2013,5,Great App! I always wait last minute to book my flight but kayak always finds me the best deals
2013,5,This app is user friendly. Loads information quickly and has great prices.
2013,5,Perfetto ! This is fantastic now i can find all what i want here wherever i am without wasting much time goodwork done. Ciao!	This is fantastic now i can find all what i want here wherever i am without wasting much time goodwork done. Ciao!
2013,5,"Just wish there was a ""delete"" option on events within the MyTrip calendar.  Brilliant!"
2013,2,Does kayak not understand that people have children I wish there was a way to input children and to say they are under 2 and if we want a lap seat or not . I was really expecting something better with all the advertising they do
2013,4,Slow in getting results. Often gets stuck at 99% and then errors out saying no network connection.
2013,1,stretched out. some parts off screen. can't scroll to see
2013,5,Good interface. Easy to use. Perfect trip organiser.
2013,4,This app is great i have no major problems at all just minor slow airline updates

2013,5,Not wild about Kayak on the net but I love this app!! So fast and easy. So far I've only searched airfares but I like what I've seen.
2013,5,Only suggestion....Is missing some airports though as it looks USA .- centric. and needs to ne more international.
2013,5,"Organises everything from trip itineraries to rental cars, flights, places to see and things to do. Read other's reviews to see if you might like it before you spend the time and money"
2013,4,I like it and it's convenient. No problems for my Galaxy S3
2013,4,"Solid app that allows you to search for flights and hotels efficiently. Not a beautiful app, but most definitely functional."

2013,5,"The app is very user friendly with low, low prices. Awesome."
2013,5,I like Kayak's business practices and the app is easy to use.  Maybe Sky scanner is more flexible but I don't like their business practices.
2013,4,Does not have all the features of the web version but works pretty well
2013,5,This site was not only very easy to navigate but also the best I have ever encountered. This will be my official travel site from this day forward...
2013,5,I have been using kayak since my simbian days and it's all a traveler needs in one place. Esp love the customizable packing list.

2013,5,Easy to use and can have multiple alerts. Tried other apps and always came back to this app. Highly recommend.

2013,5,"Been many years since I've travelled commercial air, the app quickly and clearly delivers plenty of info and it's easy to look at alternative plans."

2013,5,Really find best offers! And i always use it.
2013,5,Reliable and VERY user friendly!
2013,5,Totally handy when looking for hotel deal.

2013,5,Works well and delivers information efficiently.

2013,4,will see if it can get me good price from tbilisi to london and back for christmas

2013,5,Sometimes it may get stuck. But it works well anyway.
2013,4,I can book a trip easily anywhere I go. I only wonder if the listings for hotels is as expansive as looking on a website on the computer.
2013,4,I've found great deals! And Rarely crashes
2013,4,Always a user of this
2013,5,Why it is not the same as in Apple. FLIGHT TRACKER?
2013,5,Does its job fast and well. Samsung Galaxy S.
2013,3,I don't want Kayak to have access to my calendar so I won't be updating this app until you stop asking for that permission.
2013,4,Love this app will never look or get my plane tickets anywhere else. The easiest to use !
2013,5,Simply has everything an app needs. BUT I found that their website had cheaper flights for the exact same flights on several occasions...

2013,5,Does What It Says
2013,5,:)
2014,5,
2014,5,
2016,1,"I gave 2 stars only for interface, it is good one.. But it's the only good part of the software. The application those not display the lowest price as you can find on the airlines websites. Uninstalled! LE: why are you displying a full size commercial van and once you tap on it you will see opel zafira!! Most of titles and pictures are wrong, showing ford cars for vw and so on.."
2013,2,"I hoped that the app would have the same searching tools as the site. The flight search is limited up to +- 2 days. There is no option for more flexible dates. I would give the app 5 stars if the flex month search for flights was available, and the in flight gps map was a bit more detailed. Back to using the web site."
2013,3,"I love Kayak in general,  but the android app feels like a very clumsy port of the iOS app. The UI is slow and unresponsive, scrolling is laggy ,  and it in general just feels very unpolished in comparison. If I hadn't tried it on iOS, I might be more forgiving,  but there's no need for the android app to be this far behind. It also has a tendency to crash."
2013,2,I love using Kayak on my computer. The app...not so much! The last few months it will say problems connecting and it won't finish the search even when I'm on a wireless network and have a great signal. Happens repeatedly and is very frustrating.
2013,4,It is really helpful. I have two young kids and this makes traveling very easy to know where we should stop and when. It is faster than calling or using the browser. I do wish it would keep tracking a flight so I don't have to re-enter the info like number and what airport it departed and arriving.
2013,3,"As a app it works great, never had any issues.  Very user friendly.  However as a service usually find better prices elsewhere and the fact southwest is not included in any online site except their sucks because their prices are usually the best."
2012,3,"Powerful interface, but it can't even recognize my booking emails. Tripit can automatically detect them but I prefer the features of Kayak, so I am stuck and have to have both to use the feature I want in each app.  Really a pain in the neck."
2013,5,"Had been using Tripit, Flight Tracker, and Expedia.  Now, I just use Kayak. It's pretty friggin' perfect since they added and improved the My Trips feature. I like how it integrates with the app and flight alerts better.  Also, purchases via kayak automatically add to the itinerary. Hope the development continues on this now outstanding app. In particular, better app load sync and offline usage would be bonus."
2013,4,This tool stores your tips in one convenient spot.  The weakness is in its failure to add car rentals and hotel bookings automatically to your trip.  Yoo hove to add them manually  and that is tedious.  If that functionality is added- 5 STARS!
2013,4,"This is a good and helpful app, but it is missing two features from Kayak on other platforms. On the web, Kayak offers a one month flight search, comparing all possible 6-10 day trips in the four weeks after a given date. Online and on iOS, Kayak offers the explore feature. Both are absent here."
2013,5,"It is faster than the web, very easy to use and convenient.  Many times I need to travel to multiple cities and see different options for my trip, and this app is great for that.   I can go back and change one city only without having to start all over from scratch.  Thank you Kayak for this great tool."
2013,1,"Since last update, never loads anything. Always gives cannot open internet error message. Gets a ZERO rating from me since it became useless. Formerly I rated it a four star."
2013,4,"Very smooth user experience. No lags. But there are times the program will crash and display ""no internet connection"" while on edge network. Also when I return to the program, the results from previous searches don't automatically refresh."
2013,5,"I've used this app since March 2012, and it's still easy to use, got a wide range of options, a user-friendly lay-out without complication. I found flights and rental cars at beautiful prices within seconds."
2012,5,"It seems like things started out a little rocky for this new app, but it is excellent now! I am very pleased with the speed and design of the app. I just wish the hotel features had a few more filters available."
2013,5,I love kayak i now use only kayak whenever I am planning a vacation or am traveling. The mobile app is so fast and user friendly I find myself checking flights daily and often visiting randomly when I find a great price on flights. I recommend Kayak to ask my friends and family!
2013,2,"Very nicely developed app, in my opinion, but there exists several bugs. One of which is the progress bar only reaching 99 percent when searching for best flight deals."
2013,3,"Only used ""flights."" Easy to navigate site, comprehensive, great prices.  Only flaw, it is not obvious what the airfare $ represents: all taxes, fees included or excluded! Without that info, it's not deal-making! Don'.t ask me to go hunting for that key info; I'll simply click onto another site! :-0"
2013,4,"The app is great except it tends not to be able to keep the dates or city, change one and the other go back yo the last search.   It would be great if it could filter by miles program by the hotel. For instance, I'm a Hilton person and would like to search across all Hilton brands within their rewards program."
2012,5,"First of all very useful.  a bit of usability and adding offline capability will make it awesome.  Not sure however how deep data (the content ) it provides,  but definitely very handy to lookup for flight info. I guess best works for US"
2013,5,"I downloaded this app to check on flights, since I liked the website version.  This app contains an interface that doesn't attempt to strangle you.  What's more, it does exactly what I want it to do in locating flights.  Don't take my word for it, give it a few taps!"
2013,5,"Don't book any fares or hotel w/o consulting this app first. Also has some other really useful tools included like currency converter, packing list, fare predictor, etc."
2013,3,I have used this app for the last 3 months and I think it deserves a trial. Last time I was trying to have some currency comparison research and found that the app missed some countries - like Ethiopia. Plus the flight search sometimes return null when it shouldn't!
2013,3,"Its a good app but still needs more features like add offline maps and directions. Also a trip cost/budget option would be nice. Add lowcost airlines.    And bing maps in an android app, really?"
2012,4,"Couldn't choose my seats on the app, had to use my computer so that was annoying. Everything else is great. Would change to 5 stars if I could have completed the ticket purchase via phone app."
2013,5,"Really good app for keeping an eye on flights to a specific destination. You can track pricing trends, save your search and send notifications when prices drop. Don't get hosed by an airlines inflated price!"
2013,4,Great app - the ease of use on multiple divices is really amazing. Its simple design allows anyone the opportunity you use and for a frequent fly seeker makes my resourse skills seem much faster than what they might be otherwise.
2013,1,"This app gives inaccurate results 90% of the time for the flight prices.  Contacted developer few times to highlight this but still not resolved. This app for me is not fit for my purpose, and doesn't even deserve 1 star!"
2013,5,"I'm satisfy with the functionality of this app. Its quick, user friendly, and it does its job. Sometimes, when it has given me the rate I have gone to the airlines to check the lowest prices, and the app actually has them correctly. Congratulations KAYAK on such a good application."
2013,4,The mobile app preserves most of the features of the full functionality website. You do lose a little bit. However you do get to keep most of your filtering options which are critical and also all your personalized account options are still available
2013,5,"Very intuitive, with useful history section which remembers your last search. All it needs to do now is to allow users to save their fare search details and price, so that we can keep it for reference! Well done"
2013,5,"Hands down. Has lower prices than the other ones, sometimes saving hundreds of dollars. Check +/- 1-2 days and surrounding airports and choose a Tuesday or Wednesday for the best deals."
2013,4,Doesn't always remember my alerts am limited to 2 alerts. Fix these please. Actually the app works more easily than the website.
2013,5,"Exceptionally user friendly, adequate and helpful in all manners regarding travel. I was previously using a few other flight/travel apps, compared to this, they all fall short.  Great job!"
2013,3,"Unable to select which nearby airports, no ability to filter number of stops. Older version was better. Not all flights are shown. Zoo"
2013,5,"I use this all the time to search trips. It's never going to have full functionality like the browser site, but it's a solid app that works really well. Very satisfied."
2013,3,Good apart from all passengers are classed as adults! Has nobody at Kayak got children?  Options for young passengers please..  PLEASE NOTE! I am not the first to make this comment !
2013,4,"I don't have to pull out my compute anymore to book a flight at the last minute! Just pull out my phone and it's all there. Flight, hotel, car everything!"
2013,5,Truely a good site. I have booked last 2 flights using thia app. Totally safe and secure.  Will continue to use. No technical issues encountered on my Samsung Galaxy 3s.
2012,3,"Coming from a region, Africa and nigeria to be precise, where such apps as kayak have yet to compile a strong database of travel info, I find most useful. It has resolved a lot of travel issues for me particularly outside the continent. Highly recommended."
2013,5,Works perfect! Searches are super easy to tweak. Just wish it would show results on a calander so you can see if there are other days within your timeframe that are cheaper.
2013,3,"Great app, especially for quick tracking purposes. That said its not as functional as the full site and doesn't allow things like tracking one specific flight or the flight matrix. I'm sure they will improve it though"
2013,4,Love how it does the comparisons right there for you. No hassle. Some times I click a hotel and it takes me across town else where. Other then that works great
2013,5,I love this app so much! Wish it could have features like SkyScanner for discount flight trackers like me! Another feature it could improve is on the alerts where it needs to be checked manually instead of getting alerts on your phone.
2013,5,Why bother with traffic moving in circles to airline offices. Making phone calls that don't get answer and busy phone lines. This is the best App to to save u time n money. 5 straight
2013,5,"Its so easy to use and read . I have it on my front screen always on it . Compared prices with many competitors and you just choose whatever works for you . Highly recommend it. I have never had a problem with it , definitely a 5/5 stars"
2013,5,New user. Love all the choices! Blows Expedia out of the water. Galaxy Note 2 makes searching smokin' hot fast!
2013,5,I've been a KAYAK user for years now. The website is infallible and now the app is just as reliable. Not a doubt it is the best way to plan time away whether or not you're on a budget.
2013,5,"Awesome app. I got all the travel apps at the same time. This one beat them all. Just wish it had a way to bookmark hotels during the search. So u can view and save your favorites then narrow it down from there.   Would be helpful when there are hundreds to choose from, you find a handful,  but then need to find which one you liked best."
2013,1,"Pathetic. It sends an email "" Click here to search for this hotel and 117 others."" But my recipients can't click here!"
2013,2,"Shows correct daily rate, but shows wrong total.  Kayak acknowledged this bug a few months ago, but still hasn't fixed it.  Kayak website shows the correct total."
2013,4,Mostly a great travel companion!! Just wish there were more filters for hotel search. It would then be possible to find what you are looking for much quicker especially when the search results returns in hundreds.
2013,5,"Its an excellent tool to compare your travel options. It's easier then using the website, although the website is pretty easy too. I love that you can filter your flight and sees the planes on time record."
2013,4,This is a cool way to manage  and share trip information and keep the details where you need them. If you use it to search flights though you may be swamped with the response.
2013,5,Improved incredibly since I last used this on DHD. So much info all in one place. I will never have to use the web version again. Gratis.
2013,1,Thought I would give them a go for a German car rental. Cost more than double the price I was quoted when I went to pick up the car. I will never book through kayak again.
2013,5,Very cool that it updates with every itinerary you email it. Great usability. Needs to add Gate guru like capability to have everything in one place.
2012,5,I really think the phone app is just as good as the website and unlike other apps im not lazy about using the app over the website. Is fast and very easy to use and you don't miss any of the important features of the site.
2012,5,"Great app because it's many apps in one. Book flights, cars & hotels. Track flights. Currency converter. But the best off the fare tracker that allows you to put days in and you get daily alerts that give you the latest process. Had saved me thousands!"
2013,5,Best app I have ever used!  Everything is so easy to use and very user friendly!!  By far the best search engine I have used for all my travel needs;-)
2012,5,Don't let the simplistic layout fool you. There is so much functionality in this app. Love the price tracking feature.
2013,5,"I travel a lot, being 15 I go to Mexico often & I live in Florida, I basically go ever break in school. This app is so much easier than going on the internet & zooming all the time. Besides the prices are the cheapest :) definitely 5 stars :D besides I loooove that it has a checklist, I usually write it on paper & end up forgeting stuff c: best travel app evaaaa"
2012,5,This app is great!  Maybe if a future update would add weather at destination and maybe even a clothing size converter for other countries this would be the percent all in one travel app.
2012,5,"I use this app for most of my travel needs. Very reliable and accommodating! Thanks, Kayak! This app is a MUST for serious travelers!"
2013,5,So user friendly.... I'm always happy with the results and outcome. Almost as cool as a unicorn whose horn is wrapped in bacn.
2013,4,"This app is very user friendly and resembles the actions in the website. One down fall, you have to have full bars of reception for it to work and not freeze up your phone."
2012,5,"This is the best traveling app for your phone. Results are easy to read in the way they are displayed. Best prices, and comparisons and its easier than dltravel sites on your PC. This app is great."
2013,4,"Wonderful and excellent app. A must have apparatus,  so to speak. Able to analyse and compare airfare of different airlines at a glance; from the comfort of your home."
2013,5,Every part of this app works ALMOST perfectly! I'm extremely picky but this app can do it all. Definitely the best travel app available.
2013,5,"Tested a dozen different apps, always coming back to Kayak. Whole trip management including complex research and price alerts, plus full trip organization and helpful tips. No other app necessary, this one includes all from first research to the trip itself."
2013,4,Nicely integrated app for most of your travel planning needs.   Easy to use and app seems completely stable.  Developer did a great job with this app.
2012,4,"It's easy to use. I use it mainly for booking flight ticket. It's has two feature that I'd like the most: flexible days (+-3 says) & ""near by airport""."
2013,4,This app is nicely designed. Has a great user interface and is quick & easy to use. It works great on my Samsung Galaxy Note II.
2012,4,... would be even better if you could do +/- 3 days and also option to see graphical chart of the +/- 3 day cost. Otherwise grear app.
2013,3,"Dependable app, however the best offers are always from another site. Which depend on link follow up. Would rate higher if once an offer is presented I can make all arrangements via Kayak."
2013,5,I love this apparently and it made it super easy to book the cheapest flight to Mexico. My only complaint is that the app is sometimes behind in updating ticket prices compared to being on a web browser.
2012,3,Kayak. Com offers +/-3 days to search. This app gives only +/-2 days. Using this app i cannot search for entire week. I can only search for five days instead of seven. Everything else is great.
2013,4,"Easy to read, easy to understand.  I would give 5 stars but was confused as to how to book my flight.  Once I figured that out, I was so happy to be directed to the airline's website!"
2013,4,I recommend this app if you are already a Kayak user. This and the iOS app are not the best to use for robust searching activity however. Use the desktop PC website for that activity.
2013,5,Good app for researching and keeping track of your trips.  Previous Flight Tracker problem I had seems to have cleared.  Back to 5 stars.  Thank you.
2012,5,I use this app all the time. Cheap tickets and affordable hotels with great service. Add a taxi option when you can call a cab. That would be a great added plus.
2013,5,"I'm very happy with this app compared to others like it. Still kind of a new user but so far,  do good..."
2012,4,Love this app. works great. Haven't found anything to complain about but when I do I'll be site to up date my review.
2013,5,Its a very nice design app. User friendly and well thought out. Work flow is A grade and delivery useful info.
2013,4,I like kayak a lot.  Very easy to adjust dates and airports eyc. To easily see other rates and results.  I have been using mobile. Give it a try!
2012,5,Love all the different options i can use to find a flight and car service.... gonna keep playing and will add another review once I've bought a ticket and gone thru that process
2013,5,"Runs smooth, and easy to use... Not to mention the competitive prices! Overall, very nicely designed."
2013,5,"Its great! I also enjoy the free merchandise i get everytime i use KAYAK! THE HATS I GOT AWESOME, BUT THE JACKET AND SHIRTS ARE JUST AMAZING!! THANKS KAYAK!!"
2013,4,"Good site for quick comparisons of flights, car hire etc. Saves trawling through a number of different web sites, also makes suggestions you may not have considered. Booked some cheap flights with BA for the first time, instead of just sticking to Easyjet."
2012,5,So easy to navigate! Quickly find may different options comparing flights from different airports. Kayak us all we ever use
2013,5,It's definitely the best search engine that shows you the best options! You should still compare prices in a travel office...
2013,4,"But it never lets be book from my phone, I have to use my laptop. Could be my phone, not sure. But it is frustrating"
2013,5,I really like the fact that this app searches so many different airlines and does so quickly and efficiently. It also has a history feature to allow you to easily search for a flight you've previously search for.
2013,5,"Really useful for travel enthusiasts, especially those backpack trips and budget travels. The interface is easy to navigate."
2013,5,"Searching for flights was simple, fast, and user-friendly. Compared to similar travel apps, I found this one to be the best and definitely recommend it!"
2013,5,Great tool indeed. This app has everything a traveler needs. No bugs or freezing either when in use. Its simply efficient.
2013,4,"Good for planning your move to the US! Didn't realise air travel was so expensive!!! Good app all in all, but a bit difficult to specify a flight and have it work with airline  dates!"
2013,5,Easy to good the best deals! Much more polished interface than BlackBerry. Highly recommended for the frequent traveler.
2012,5,This app is a dream for people like me who are always looking for a deal. It provides great information about trends and alerts. Definitely an app to have in your repertoire.
2013,5,"Fast and most reliable. However, you still want to check one or two other sites depending on where your flying. Ie southwest airlines for southwest flight comparisons, but overall gabe me great info and worked fast!"
2013,4,"I love the app. Easy to use, fast and have been able to find some good deals."
2013,5,It's an amazing planning tool for all types of travel arrangements... I love it!
2013,5,My one and only source for any trips I make.. lowest prices and user friendly application...thanks Kayak team
2013,5,Works brilliantly when connected via a browser. However if you have a large music collection it is too slow for copying files from pc to phone.
2013,5,"Having used numerous apps to make travel arrangements, I can say without qualm or hesitation that KAYAK is the most user friendly and most effective method to price compare. A+"
2013,5,"This app is great, even for people you don't travel that often. Wonderful UI backed by solid features!"
2013,4,"whenever I solicit prostitutes , I use this app to find cheap hotel rooms , and it never lets me down.. I can't say the same for the prostitutes .."
2013,4,"I like using this app. I wish that it had as many filters as the regular webpage did, but for that I can just open web browser."
2013,4,"Works well for flights and hotels, cars don't work for me as the pricing does not include coupon codes and special  deals."
2013,5,"It is just so easy to use and find what you are looking for, an compare prices. The aded finctio nakiti of a reminder, trip asistent an check list is a plus. Just vhouthev liked i I can precash the information so that i do not need to find a wifi spot vhen I am abroad and do nit have internet in roaming"
2013,1,"Rubbish.  Doesn't list my direct flight, gives me transit options for more money.  Dont bother"
2012,5,Love it's awesome features like real-time flight tracking and gate information. Good app.
2013,1,Didn't like this app as it's difficult to change the currency settings. We all don't live in the USA.
2013,5,Very easy to use. I highly recommend it for all types of cells. Love how easy it is to use this app for booking hotels an airline. I give this app an A+
2013,4,"Love it. Twice to Seattle, great deals. Used mobile app both times, no issues."
2013,5,"First and foremost, Kayak has always provided an amazing service. This app takes the reliability of their search results and combines it with a sharp and fast UI."
2013,5,"Very effective. This app loads smoothly and quickly, shows accurate flight prices, and most importantly gives up to date information on in-transit flights.  It never crashed on me, no pun intended."
2013,5,Works great and easy. I have no problem navigating thru d site. Better than I expected
2013,5,"One suggestion. When searching flights, there are few options to sport the results, but the option for direct flight/number of connections is missing."
2013,5,"I've used it just for searching for flights, and for that it is great. It's very easy to do different kinds of searches and sorting. The flight search history is wonderful to have as well."
2013,5,This is a great app for planning travel and tracking the details once booked.  I forward all of my itineraries to Kayak and they group them in the app.  No more printing confirmations or searching email. Real time text with gate numbers and baggage claim have always been accurate.
2013,3,No discount hotel prices life expedia love the features but need to get discounts!
2013,5,"I loved the website, and this app gets to share that love. It makes things so convenient to look up on the go. I'm quite spontaneous and don't makes plans to do anything, I just go. This app makes doing that so much easier."
2013,5,Does exactly what it says. Will give five stars once support for travel insurance policies is added and better individual traveller information handling is implemented.
2013,4,Would be 5 stars if they added the nearest airport feature they have on standard web site. Best app out there though.
2012,5,Really nice app. Works creat. Not complain at all. Thanks
2013,5,"Love it... easy to use.  Not always the best prices for flights, but indicative pricing is good enough for me."
2013,4,"Decent list of hotel. But all are in usd$ ,well its india meri jann..should mention cost in rupees."
2013,5,I use this app several times a week to track the flights for our clients. It is very accurate and very easy to use. It saves me time and keeps me up to date on the flight status. Love it.
2013,5,"Great for frequent travelers, especially those who use multiple airlines. The flight tracker feature and airport maps are really good."
2012,3,"It's good, but kindda slow in my phone, the speed can be improved. Also the prices can be made more competitive, but overall it is good."
2013,5,Using this app is just as useful and easy to navigate as the website from my laptop. I recommend this app for avid travelers and vacation planners.
2013,2,"Ok app. Im not able to get those push notifications i set up.,"
2013,5,"This app runs great, even on my cheap little Optimus Elite. It has a solid build with very little lag/wait time and searching for flights super easy. A+++."
2013,1,Sorry but I have yet to find cheap deals on any flights.  It's cheaper to go straight to the airlines website.
2013,5,"Whether it's a browser or an app, content rules and Kayak is the best with a straightforward interface as well! I use it weekly."
2013,5,"Easy to use, just as simple as the full site and lots of extra helpful features. Great app!"
2013,5,"Best way to check fares quickly. Remembers your previous search settings, offers good filters."
2013,5,The best ever flights app. Always spot on. Helps u get the best prices as well. Its always up to date. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who does travels a lot worldwide. I give it 5 stars *****
2013,5,I use it to find france/brazil flights in a regular base and they always find deals that I cant findin other apps. Really like it
2013,5,"I've been using Kayak from before people had smartphones and apps. Love the site, love that I can now search from my phone."
2013,5,Works great. I like the +- 2 days on searching for flights. It's the best flight app I've found.
2013,4,"Works really well, just like the full site. Always my starting point for travel search."
2013,5,I was using it on their website to arrange for my trips. Now it is perfect to have it on my galaxy. It is a great app.
2013,5,This is a great app to buy cheap flights with the best airlines. Also great for all sorts of travel needs. I will keep using this app.
2012,4,Very good for keeping all travel details in one place. Also easy to quickly get flight status for catching or meeting a flight
2013,5,Pictures come out better than the original hotel site. I downloaded all the kayak apps after using this. Really impressed with how good the app is i had to write a review:
2013,5,"I do a lot of business travel, and I always go to my Kayak app for my travel planning. Even if I don't purchase through them, it is the quickest way to find, route and price a trip. Indispensible!"
2013,5,Works like a charm. A feature I'd like to see is alerts for hotel price changes.
2013,2,"How about adding a metric preference for those of us not in the US,  so I don't have to think in feet and miles?  I'd give it a better rating then!"
2013,5,"Great app for keeping track of trip information. Better than american airlines, united airlines, or tripit for showing flight and airport information. Very easy to get around in."
2013,4,Been very helpfull so far and the cheapest flights out them all. Would be 5 but you cant choose children on the flight option.
2013,4,"Very crisp, user friendly interface. Fast results"
2013,5,Its really convenient to use for my galaxy note II makes me find better flight skeds and promos really AWESOME!! (y)
2013,3,Doesn't use all the airlines. Couldn't find a fairly timely flight.  8 - 11 hrs not worse the savings.
2012,1,"I do believe that it might eventually be possible to get airfare information out of this app, but I expect that by the time I do, they'll be obsolete. Worthless crap app."
2013,5,Great app. Needs to improve prices. Everything else is fi e and good interface. But some prices are too high..................... Check your servers
2013,4,"If you travel alot or just once in a blue moon, this app is simple and to the point. Only problem is plane tickets are expensive(not kayaks fault)"
2013,4,"Only thing keeping it from 5 stars are the loading errors it frequently encounters.  Also, consider bundles...best part of booking together is the bundle discounts."
2013,5,Set up alerts and wait for your travel prices to go down. Highly recommended if you want to save money. Solid app with no bugs.
2012,1,Kayak found basic fares and went to the big pricey fares first. It did not go with the basic low fares and did not show all flights.
2012,5,I have uses this app for work and for play and it always finds the best prices. The new interface is very fast and easy to use.
2013,3,It adds an extra day to rental cars you ask for two and it gives prices for three. Whether you actually pay that price or if it actually gives you that extra day I don't know.
2013,4,"Doesn't have all of the features of the desktop site, but is still very useful."
2013,4,This app is really cool.  Its actually hrloed save me from doing numerous Google searches for flights
2013,5,Amazing! Great way to organize the while trip in one app. So glad I found this baby..You will not be dissapointed.
2013,5,The best  fast keeps your record of flights and all hotel and car rentals in one place so you can always it on your phone when ever you need it. Plus
2013,5,I use it often searching for flights.  Quicker and more reliable using WiFi.
2013,5,"Performed several test of searches, App returned appropriate results in a short period of time."
2013,4,"The updates for flight tracking are not accurate. Prices are ok, is like simmilar apps"
2013,5,"Very fast, works like a charm! Kayak is one of the best travel apps out there."
2013,5,Has everything that a traveler would need! Get this app . The interface is awesome.
2013,5,Fantastic app. Use it all the time to book my flights. I fly international long haul several times a year. Finds the best itineraries and prices every time.
2013,3,My husband shared the itinerary for our upcoming trip with me. I can see it under My Trips on the website but won't show up in the app.
2013,4,"It would be nice if you could track flights further in the future. You can only put in flights 3 days ahead of time, would be nice if you can put them in 2 - 3 weeks ahead"
2013,5,The user interface keeps getting better. I enjoy using this app for my trips.
2012,4,"Good app for my favorite travel site. Not as many features as the Web version, but does what it does well."
2013,5,"Made a booking with kayak, had no problems and my itinerary was ready in mins.. thanks"
2012,5,"So nice to be able to find hotels, flights, etc in one place on an android app; and at the lowest rates!!!  :D"
2013,4,Very convenient app. Very user friendly. Can improve the display. Cheers!
2012,1,"""There is a problem with your network connection"".  Only app to ever tell me this. Wont track my flights. Bye bye kayak."
2013,5,"Just eneogh features for what you need, not to many to make it complicated! 2 thumbs up"
2013,3,Would like to be able to add child fares. No option to remove multi stop flights.
2012,5,wonderful easy to use packed with features.. try..it ll not let you down...
2013,5,Find great deals on anything for your vacation. Love it
2013,3,It provides cheapest rates of the day u select but If you want to find which day fligh rates r cheaper it won t show that..this the biggest drawback of the app....so i rated....3 star
2013,5,I use it all the time to discover flight options. Saves me a lot of time and liberates me from constraints of other booking systems.
2013,5,I love kayak and that it is easy to access and manipulate to what I need.  It also gives all the normal search functionality of the normal site but in a mobile version!
2013,5,Great app very easy to use and alot of options for making it work just for what i am looking for thanks.
2013,5,"Turns out, some apps are better designed for US of A; this one's  it. Been using Skyscanner during the last 4 years living in Europe, and misjudged this one  until now."
2012,5,Its refreshing to find an app that works. I use this all the time to quickly compare rates and book.
2013,5,Works perfectly. Has all the details. Other similar apps doesn't include as much as Kayak.
2013,4,"Easy to use and responsive. This is my Goto to travel app. my only Complaint Is the flight tracker, which sent me to the wrong gate once."
2013,1,This app clearly says that it wants access to your confidential information as well as other sensitive material!  Most people install this without realizing that it is essentially malware!!!
2013,4,"Have been using this a few years and just love it, saved me once when I missed my flight and needed to book a new ticket, this app saved me a quite a few quid"
2013,5,Seems so many apps work either slowly or intermittently. This works quickly and never seems to crash.
2013,2,The prices never match the website. I'll get an email from kayak saying that a ticket is $258 and then I look at the app and it says $444.
2013,2,the app was working fine now for the past 2 weeks it keeps saying oops. I don't know what's wrong with it but it ain't working right
2013,4,"Wish there were a default to always search nonstops only and change if need to open up options, other than that, love it."
2013,5,I actually find kayak easier and quicker on my phone than on my desktop. A rarity but this app is that good.
2013,4,Great app guys! Keep up the good work. I think traveling for me just got alott easier!
2013,5,Easy to search for travel deals and awesome tools to use during the trip. I don't use anything else.
2013,4,"Understand several airlines don't want to participate , but mostly they are ones who have cheap rates but charge for everything (carry on, checked, etc.)"
2013,5,Really easy to use. Finds great deals. Highly recommend.
2013,5,It does what exactly says it does. Great app. I recommend it.
2013,5,Works well but some hotel price is shows fair. When select and see the details not the same as shown previously.
2013,5,Has Expedia and Priceline blown away. So easy to multitask between flights and hotels and car rental. Freakin sweet!
2013,4,Got a Price of 697 Went to travelocity started out at 636 got to end oops we are sorry that Price has changed to 696. At least kayak was straight up
2012,5,I really like this app when just doing a quick flight search. I also love the flight tracker for any current flights that I'm on.
2013,3,You have to be clever with your input and persevere with different options. Nice Android app though.
2013,4,Love the website itself and the app is very convenient! So far so good! Will check it out while I look for alerts for cheap flights to Vegas!
2013,4,I have used this a few times and it works ok.y only problem is that the times listed for departure is so late in the day.it does however give you an idea of the costs.
2012,4,"It's current,accurate and precise,4 stars because it does not have flight alert if the price drops or increases, overall I recommend it"
2013,5,"I love how you can forward them all of your travel confirmation emails from almost any source and they will miraculously create an interactive travel plan for you within minutes using the emails, obviously some very clever software involved.  As a traveller this is a killer app."
2013,2,Hasn't really done anything for me that any or site does try it compare it doesn't ! Just not sure at this time we will see in future I'll give it some time.
2012,4,Good enough and easy to use though I don't know that the price alerts work well for notification.
2012,5,Phenomenal!!! Saved hundreds by looking at the matrix of +/- 3 day option! Love this app!
2012,4,"Haven't booked anything yet, but its super easy to use and catches the details you need."
2013,4,"Maybe sometimes it's glitchy on price alerts, it doesn't save new alert but going out and on again fixes the problem."
2013,4,Very fast ans complete. Even like the mobile version more than pc
2013,4,"Good breadth of features, good performance. Useful on both Galaxy Tab 2 and DroidX2."
2013,5,Just one thing needs to be added. A way to check flexible dates.

2013,5,"This app is pretty cool...it saves my last search, so everyday I can just check to see what the process are looking like. Our also has the price drop alert"

2013,5,Love this app. Planning a trip this summer has an auto alert on price changes.
2013,5,"Easy to use app allows you to choose flex travel days and select multiple filters for price, stops, airlines, etc.  If you're ready to purchase, it takes you to the airline site itself which can make you feel a bit more at ease purchasing the airline ticket."

2012,5,"I use this for my business and personal trips! It is so much better than carrying around a bunch of papers! Plus, I can easily see what is going on each day!"
2012,2,This is new. Formerly good app now wants log file info with no explanation. Uninstalled.
2012,1,Gets stuck at 99% all the time please fix on android 2.3.4
2012,5,This app is amazing! I planned my whole trip to Dubai using this app to book a flight and a hotel room and to rent a car at amazing prices!
2012,5,I always check Kayak first. Many times I have completed a booking while en-route on an airplane.
2012,5,I use the app a lot to finde the best price of tickets.
2012,5,For me as a frequent fligher and an airline staff i found this app is excellent and a must have.
2012,5,Really enjoy using this App for the best prices.
2013,4,It help you to compare  Between flights
2013,4,Works great!
2012,4,Very easy on Android.
2012,5,Everything's just nice :)
2012,5,The only travel app I use.
2012,1,Keeps on giving up on loading at 99%
2012,5,Seems good to me.  It does what it says it does.
2012,5,App works perfectly.
2012,4,Good and helpful application
2012,5,البرنامج رائع و فوق الخيال و كمان سهل الإستخدام مفيد لأقصى درجة لكثيري السفر
2012,5,Excellent product. No complies.
2012,4,Easy to use
2012,5,User friendly !! Great app!!!
2012,5,Love the tablet version
2012,5,Well organised
2012,5,Looks and filters great
2012,5,excellent app
2012,5,Needs Google maps integration
2012,5,Doll :)
2012,4,"I mostly use Kayak for the ""My trips"" itinerary bookkeeping. It keeps track of your flights, hotels, appointments, rental car, etc when on a trip. It is missing some features:  * Directions to ""Hotel"" using Google Map (or other map applications installed on phone) * Ability to EDIT/ADD trip and details"
2012,1,"New update changed the permissions to allow reading the device's log.  Not needed in the old version.  Why change it?  Now it can snoop more personal data on how you use your device.  Not good.  Hopefully, this kind of review will get them to change it back."
2012,1,Alerts did not update at all.  Even wwhen I did manual updates they still showed old prices.  Alerts also didn't do any kind of alerting.  I would have to manually go in each day and check flights.  Prices were also $100 to $200 higher than going to the airline's website.
2012,3,"The number 1 thing I would change is to turn the sliders for flight times into a regular clock/type in your time input system. It's difficult and annoying to choose the right time I want on the sliders. Overall a nice app, but with design issues."
2012,5,"LOVE FEATURES: flight tracking, DETAILED info on airports (yay!!), GPS tracking flight ur ON, EVERYTHING.  Nicely done people. Seems pretty user friendly also. Constructive critique:: 1)Flights: Could use feature searching nearby airports w/choice of distance from current loc. 2)Flights: its great that there's an option for +\- days, but for me not working (only orig selected date is showing). 3)Flights: would b nice to b able to select min/max $ b4 search. 4)PLEASE add restrm loc to airport maps."
2012,2,"This is a good app but I'm having a hard time figuring out why its latest update is requiring permission to ""Read sensitive log data"". This means that they have access to the following:  Google accounts (email addresses) Names of apps installed URLs that apps requested to open in the browser through Intents Geographic locations of where the phone has been lately Google Reader feed URLs WiFi scan results  Because I can't figure out why in the world Kayak would need any of this information, I'm rating it 2 stars instead of 4 or 5."
2012,5,"I got a call from Etihad airways saying my flight is delayed by 1 hour. Tried several apps to check the status of the flight, but no luck.. And finally checked KAYAK and found it's got everything what I'm looking for. Like to see new features.. Keep up the good job."
2012,5,"I installed kayak just before leaving for a trip. It gives accurate information and updates extremely quickly.  For instance, a plane I was waiting to board had mechanical issues so we had to change gates, but the airline was waiting to find out which gate we were moving to. As soon as they found out they made an announcement.  Checked my kayak app just for giggles and was surprised it had already updated the gate too, within 30 seconds of finding out from the airline in person!"
2012,4,"I haven't been using it long, but so far the thing that strikes me the most about the kayak app is how easy the interface is. It's very simple to download and instantly start searching for flights. Everything is very intuitive."
2012,1,I can run 2 kayak searches at the same time. One using the phone app and one using the Kayak website in the laptop browser. Phone app returns lowest price of $7145 while website returns lowest price of approx $1220. Exact same search criteria.
2012,5,"I enjoy some of the commercial even ,  every time I skip a song I get a 30 sec informative commercial about 2 different jingles. Overall catchy tune you will know every word after 1 maybe let's say 2 hours max.  Cheers to free music"
2012,5,"This app is perfect for finding the best airfare. It works quick especially if you're flexible with dates as you can quickly alter the search parameters. The results show all the pertinent information including remaining seats, a percentage showing how often flights are on time, and the length of your layover if any."
2012,1,I cannot fathom why this is necessary or why it should provide me with an improved user experience. I need a reason and an explanation before upgrading. Sensitive means I'm not giving it to just anyone for anything.
2012,5,I love this app. It saves me so much time when searching for flights. I no longer need to check out several sights to find the best deal! Very easy to use and convenient.
2012,4,I like this app. Very handy and provides you a very nice interface to work on. Would be better if they include other options like flexible date selection as well.
2012,4,"Kayak is the easiest and most complete booking agent.  Android app not showing calendar matrix, my fav.  So I will hold one star till they add it."
2012,1,"I think there is no need to read the sensitive user data!!!  I will not update to the new version, and i may uninstall it if the permission not removed."
2012,5,"We've booked hotels, flights, and cars with Kayak. And we have no doubt that Kayak helped us find the best deals. This is a must have app for those who travel!"
2012,3,"Great interface and smooth operation, but most hotels are listed as ""call"" instead of having the price. Also, would like to filter by lodge/cabin or room/suite."
2012,5,I've only needed to use it a few times now but it works and works well. I like that I put in the dates for airfare search and it remembers the dates for the hotel and car searches. No crashes or lockups. GalaxyS3
2013,5,I use Kayak not just for my regular travel bookings but also for those last minute flight bookings in the airport when you just missed your flight or your flight just got cancelled. Has saved my day several times.
2012,1,Was a great app until they changed permissions to include read sensitive log data. Will be uninstalling and urge others to do the same. I will reinstall if that permission is dropped.
2012,3,"The only reason I use Kayak is the multi-city search.  The android version doesn't support this, as far as I can tell."
2012,4,"Seems to find flights for one price but then price increases when you actually click on it. Other apps have the same problem though, so not a major fault."
2012,5,"All I ask is that I get multiple options and that the app doesn't shut down everyone I attempt to use it.  So far, so good..."
2012,5,I use Kayak all the time when I'm planning a trip. Only thing is finding a hotel cheaper later down the line nearing the day of my trip but I know it's not Kayaks fault. Overall the app and Kayak services are great! Definitely recommend it!
2012,4,"Switched from the pay Alps to Kayak. Keeps me updated as to flight times, departure & arrival gates, etc. Also, keeps track of travel itineraries."
2012,5,Works great on my Android phone. No issues at all! I Love it and use it at least 3-4 times a week if not more.
2012,5,"Great app, great interface, easy to use, finds the best deals in less than a few seconds. Highly recommended!"
2012,4,"Very useful app, but sometimes doesn't offer full spread of results or filters as the web site. Usually not a problem. It's still favorite overall travel search app."
2012,5,"Great app. As a government employee that does a large number  of Wounded Warrior escorts, Kayak has become an indispensable tool."
2012,5,"Never had any probs with this app. Use it to buy tickets and track my flights. Thanks, Kayak team"
2012,4,I've only just had a play but it has hotels and flights in Australia. I'll get back to you when I've actually booked something.
2013,5,"The best one stop shop for travel. No need to go anywhere else, so easy to use and well thought-out interface"
2012,4,"So far so good, app seems to do what it says. Can't wait to find a great deal on plane tkts."
2012,5,App works perfect on my Galaxy S3! Love it and highly recommend! Seems all bugs are fixed now....
2012,5,Fast and clean UI.  Great price alerts.  All around fun experience.  Always finds the best price.
2012,5,"Only site where I can look at multiple airports and flexible dates on the same search. All prices reflect taxes and fees, so i can compare real cost. Only ""complaint"" is that website allows you to search 3 days +/-, and app only lets you do 2..."
2012,1,Can't see any reason or need for this.  Not updating
2012,1,"Told me my flight was 1 hrs 10 mins delayed, yet it was on time! Good thing I went to the airport anyways."
2012,4,"Great interface and nice to use. Really needs the ability to manually edit ""my trips"" though"
2012,5,Hi i am Roy from Singapore .  I like to go overseas for holiday anytime. And I find this app is really use full for find and hotel          and flight at right time . This apps is excellent !!!
2012,5,"Seriously, I'm a technology professional and I apply heavy scrutiny to applications that attempt and I mean attempt to 100 percent replace having to go online with a PC to book travel. Finally--an app that offers a FULL experience. This mobile app exceeds the expectations of a mobile app."
2012,4,"Overall a very good and handy app, especially for flight. Does an extensive search so you get a good choice and prices.Not that good for hotels, I don't seem to be able to filter out what I need."
2012,3,There are times this app us wonderful and gives me hotels to look up but there are times it will tell me there I'd nothing available. I have only used the app aa guide and done all my actual reservations online.
2012,5,Great site. I enjoy this either on the go or at work or where ever. I can book a ticket n done. Quick info at ur finger tips. Pretty fast as well.
2012,5,You could not ask for a better app!! nvr crashes always works!! an is spot on with times an everything!! 10+ stars all the way!!
2012,1,It jaks the price up.if you dont bhy it first time. Then you go back price goes up!	Not cheap prices
2012,4,Pretty simple app.... works great!  Been a fan of kayak for years.
2012,5,Excellent app. Very easy to use. This app has almost all for travel.
2012,4,This app was a huge time saver and far more informative than the other travel apps.
2012,3,Very user-friendly but rates for flights often inaccurate/out of date.
2012,5,"Have to honestly rate a full 5 stars as simply above average doesn't seem high enough. Occasional freeze here and there, but for results, Kayak has become a go to app for me."
2012,5,"I use to go all the on different website to check for flights, now i have KAYAK i don't have to do this anymore. Thanks"
2012,4,"Overall I love this app's functionality, my only complaint is that if you leave a search and go back to your home screen, and then try to reopen the app it has to re-search and freezes at 98%."
2012,5,No problems with this app. Works pefect. Fast. Accurate. Very useful
2012,5,Works very well. I'm on it all the time. Thank you
2012,4,This app has everything you need if you want to fly somewhere. I won't use anything else!
2012,4,Great little application ... thanks for fixing the sensitive log data permission.
2012,5,Great app. Love the My Trips feature.
2012,5,"It is great, but I wish that it could give me the age limits. Because some dont allow car rentals to certain ages..."
2012,3,Recently added the Sensitive Log right. Why? So much for security conscious. Uninstalling.
2012,5,"Good job, works fast, has a lot of useful tools. Awesome"
2012,4,Tells good prices.But it runs fast up to 99% then it stucks also it shows bad net connection and stops .even u r in good coverage.there some fixing required.pricewise good.
2012,5,Very user friendly!  Fast results.  Love it!
2012,5,It's on point. Works even better and faster than the web site lol
2012,5,I book on kayak to save all itenerary items to my trips automatically... sweet then I have my sales trip plans on my GN II.
2012,1,Un-installing due to sensitive info requirements.
2012,5,"I work as a personal secretary and when my boss has to travel every couple weeks or so, it really comes in handy. Its a life saver!"
2012,5,As a consultant I travel every week with changing schedules. It is so easy to find the best combination of price and schedule in Kayak that sabes me lots of time and money.
2012,5,This is how I buy most of my airline tickets now. Great app!
2012,5,I just got this app. So far I find it super easy to use and maneuver through flight options.
2012,4,Great place to find your trips. They save You time and money. They have it all .
2012,3,I have used Kayak mainly for trip info but initial searching is person related without differentiating between adults and children.
2012,1,"Major problem with this program, consistently showed higher airfares as compared to the kayak website, can't trust it now."
2012,5,"Nice aggregator and filters. Always used the desktop version, but this is convenient."
2012,4,"At last, an app that does multi destinations. Only used for 3 days now but no issues so far."
2012,5,Useful for finding.. but still have to add many features in it
2012,2,"Search failed,search failed this site sucks. Improve it earlier version was good"
2012,5,"So convenient. No problems right off the shelf. I'm sold. Stayed in a dozen hotels in target city, this was spot on."
2012,4,App works well. Smooth easy to use.
2012,5,Best travel app. I'm in the military and it really helps me find flights for cheap when I go on leave! Great app!
2012,5,I've been using kayak for years and I love being able to have it available at any time I want so I can make my travel arrangements.
2012,5,"Easy to use, thanks for making a great app!"
2012,2,Does not have a daily cheapest comparison utility like skyscanner. Cannot search all airports in a city at once.
2012,5,"Lots of cool features, nice search capabilities. Love it."
2012,5,Easy & straight forward to use.  Great mobile version of full website.
2012,5,Easy and quick. Great app with great filters. Much faster on app then on internet site via mobile device.
2012,5,Best airline ticket finder in the bussines. Fast search and great interface !
2012,5,Excellent...pl. add indian rupee as basic currency
2013,5,Works fine on Galaxy S2 with JB. Fares almost always on the lowest end.
2012,5,"The app is great. Easy to use, performs well, and booking is streamlined. Prices are another story but that isn't the apps fault."
2012,5,Very easy to use.  Great mobile interface with ability to create alerts.
2012,5,"Brilliant app a must have for all travellers simple and easy to use and not taking up to much room , good job five stars from me"
2012,4,"Only issue is, I'd like to check multiple flights sometimes and it's not an option for flight alerts on the mobile app."
2012,3,"What does the new permission (""Read sensitive log data"") really mean? Why is it needed?"
2012,5,Accurate flight status. All the other info you could possibly need
2012,5,Very helpful app--one-stop shop for travel searches and more...includes flight tracker and currency converter...excellent app!
2012,4,Lot of options available on the phone just like a computer
2012,5,Fast access to prices. Makes it easy to get info you need.
2012,5,Wish they would do a side by side comparison between the travel site's. Besides that great app!
2012,5,"I really like the app. I work in travel and I basically use it everyday. Part from that, very very handy and easy to use."
2012,5,"Entered a few details, found the flight and booked it. That easy."
2012,5,"i found this app to be simple, and quick. very happy."
2012,5,"Great interface, works smoothly."
2012,1,Why does this app need access to sensitive log data?  I'm just going to use the website from now on.
2012,5,I travel several times a month and kayak is by far the best for keeping track of all my reservations.  Its never let me down.
2012,5,Works really well.
2012,5,The best one I've tried awesome amazing app works perfectly great job thank you thank you
2012,2,It's such a useful app but always quits once I try to go back from selecting a hotel.
2012,5,I love it. Makes reading easy for busy on the go people like me.
2012,4,A combined flight and hotel search would be great. Better than expedia and other similar apps.
2012,4,Love their online site and am excited that each iteration of the app gets closer and closer to that.
2012,4,WHAT??? Why does KAYAK need to read my log files? Isn't reading my phone state and GPS location enough?
2012,2,I selected a specific return date and it keeps showing other return dates. Booked the wrong flight once because of that.
2012,4,"A few features missing and so close to perfect, if it had the ability to search by location from a point it would be 5 stars"
2012,5,"Super, extra saving. Very practical. Download now."
2012,4,"Sometimes loses saved flight tracking settings, but otherwise amongst my favorite travel apps."
2012,5,Great and easy to use. #1 travel app for me. (GS3)
2012,2,to do your job. Just stop.
2013,4,"Nice app, but classes at times. Definitely better than using the website."
2012,5,Works great on S3
2012,4,Love using this app! Love how you can get Alerts with the flights you choose ;)
2012,4,"Pretty good app, just like the website. I don't book tickets with anyone else"
2012,4,App is a great site but doesn't include all the airlines.
2012,4,"Great app! So easy to use, I wish I had this for past vacations!"
2012,4,Would be a lot more convenient if it was a tad bit faster... other wise good app :)
2012,2,Sharjah to Ahmedabad Air Arabia flights are missing. It is least expensive flight on that sector
2012,5,Works great. Very convenient.
2012,5,"Have used this in ten different countries and it is a cut above the rest, easy to use and well-sourced."
2012,5,Works very well on my note 2....
2012,5,Works as good as the online version.
2012,4,If only they can have a setting where you can always search for specific requests. That way when you look for any flight you dont have to filter every flight.
2012,1,App does not fit on the screen and does not scroll to the right so you can't get to the buttons
2012,5,"Kayak has a great website, I can almost argue the application is better. Extremely helpful when planning a trip!"
2012,4,"Good interface, truly a mobile app and not just a web port, easy controls and fully functional"
2012,5,Love the in flight GPS!
2012,5,It is very easy to use and gets great fares....doesnt mean u shoukdnt check other websites too...;)
2012,3,3 stars for using slow loading and cumbersome Bing maps..
2012,5,"Great deals, very easy to use!"
2012,4,I like this app. A lot. Its extremely helpful when I'm out on the go.
2012,4,I enjoy Kayak.  Sorry it's being bought by priceline
2012,5,Works great found great deals searches multiple sites
2013,4,Gøød app works like its supposed to but idk if tHe fligHts are cHeaper online or on app
2012,4,I havent reserved any travel yet but seems like very user friendly.
2012,5,Muy bueno y completo puedo revisar el status de los vuelos en tiempo real	Excelente app. Muy completa todo lo que se necesita para viajar.
2012,5,I sometimes had to open the laptop when traveling but this will save new alot of time and money!
2012,4,"Well, one of the best application and one of those which work extremely wonderfull"
2012,3,Still missing some functionality front the website and iOS
2012,4,Easy to use and pulls lowest fares quickly.
2012,5,"This app has made planning for trips over 9,000 times better!!"
2012,5,Outstanding app. I love it can surf so much faster than on a computer.
2012,5,"A great app. Not quite as powerful as the website, but still a good resource."
2012,3,Times don't display for departing flights on galaxy note 2
2012,5,Great job. Works very good
2012,5,"Very helpful for getting prices,  flight and lots more info!"
2012,4,Great filter & sort features for both flights and hotels!
2012,4,Excellent app...better than the web versiin of kayak i must say
2012,4,"It doesn't let you choose children, only adults."
2012,5,Awesome!! Works every time

2012,4,"Have only played around with this once and to look up various combinations of flights (And not hotels etc.) but first impressions are very good.  Seems quite adept at finding great deals on flights, and will prove as useful to me for air fares as Avantix Traveller is for looking up rail fares! :-)    One thing I must point out though is that it seems quite data-hungry, so users on limited 3G plans might want to proceed with care."
2012,4,"I've recently switched over to using Kayak as a full travel management app, rather than just a flight checker, and haven't been disappointed. It's quicker and easier to use than Tripit & World material and has more features. Only two gripes; it would be nice to have some integration with Google calendars, and the currency exchange feature doesn't work."
2012,1,Main searchs works quickly and all seems well till the Booking links which sometimes appears stuck or slow. Uses lots memory Crashes frequently so unstable your reviews never loaded either
2012,2,"Searching for 4 guests to stay in 3 rooms over 10 nights. Results comes up  ie ""total price $1460.00 (4 guests, 3 rooms)"". I click on ""book"" to confirm the deal only to find out that ""total price"" is NOT ""total price"". Its only price per room. Why list the total price for 4 guests in 3 rooms when this is not true. This is VERY misleading. Please fix."
2012,4,"I feel this app is even faster then the brilliant kayak web site,  and is fantastic for quickly checking flight prices when discussing potential trips with friends at the coffee shop.   However the app suffers from looking like a ported iPhone app. This style looks dated on modern Android 4 devices like the Nexus 7 and HTC One X. I'm not sure if it is the rounded corners or the blurred upscaled graphic. Perhaps a slightly native style for bigger screens?"
2012,4,"Nice, easy to use interface.  Could use more filter options, like airline alliance.  As with the browser version, the search engine doesn't always find the cheapest fare possible, but better than some I've tried.  Good for shortlisting airlines for manual searching.  Essential app for travel planning."
2012,5,"This a very very useful application. It reduces the time you may use searching for flights, or hotels online and just puts it all in onevapplication, easy forbyou to search and book. I have personally been able to find many cheap flights here than on anywhere else. I don't use anything but kayak when I book my flights or anything else. If you're looking for great awesome deals on flights, hotels, and/or cars, don't be foolish and get this app. I love it"
2012,4,"Very reliable up however I don't understand why should be over 10 megabytes of update, very good chatting system and other plus things,	Very reliable program in general speaking,  however I don't understand why should be over 10 Mb megabytes of update, also another negative point of it is that few or ~ ( 4 ) hours before the flight we can't see anything about any flights so it will not help for last minute travellers... Very good tracking system, also very easy to use."
2013,3,Would like it better if you could FILTER REQUESTS BEFORE SEARCHING! There are times when I want all the available options BUT there are times when I only want pricing from one or two car rental agencies of airlines. If this was added the search would provide results much more quickly.
2012,4,"Kayak is still more expensive than going directly through the airline. The flight I just booked is 60$ more on this site. But the app is good. Loads fast, has lots of options and takes you directly to their partner sites."
2012,4,"Flight tracker is a great addition to the app, allows you to keep track of any flights you or someone you need to pick up from the airport is on. That way you know if there is a delay. Also allows you to be notified if there is a drop in prices of flights you may be trying to book. Not to mention most of the other features on the Kayak website."
2012,5,"Works great. Search multi city flights, first class flights and it shows all the other Web sites pricing. Maybe if they showed amenities included with each airline, like baggage fees or meals, that could be useful. It's a great app!"
2012,5,"I'm new to the smartphone game, and I have to say that this is by far the most useful app I've used yet. It is easy to use and got me a great deal on a flight to see my family for Christmas time. Time will tell if it still provides useful through the whole process, but so far I am loving it!"
2012,5,"First place I look when planning air travel for biz or pleasure.  Very intuitive.  And everytime I think it's as good as it can get, the next update is even better.  Kudos to your s/w dev team!"
2012,5,"Fantastic application. Not only good search for flights & hotels etc but also useful additions - itinerary (including non Kayak bookings), packing list, airport info, flight tracker. Brilliant!  It's my essential travel app. Thank you."
2012,4,"When you try to mail itinerary details flight times are incremented by one in the message body. For example, real departure time in search results is 22:50 and arrival time is 03:30. It is correct times. But when you press ""mail search results"" button you get a draft message with departure 23:50 and arrival 04:30. Please correct this bug and I will give this app 5 stars. The app is really great."
2012,5,"Love this app because I travel a lot..for fun...so I always look for deals...i try to go somewhere every month and I love kayak's searches better than any other site! They fixed a lot of the bugs and it world so fast and so good now, I can only give it 5 stars...but it deserves 10!"
2012,5,Best flight app out there. Love the +/-1 or 2 day search option. Have saved tons of money from that alone.
2012,4,"Now, let me preface this with, I just downloaded the app, so, more time may reveal obstacles. Having said that, in comparison to using this same site (once) on my laptop I find it much more user friendly."
2012,4,I've found great deals with this program more than once.  Real good with last minute travel.  Although shop around as other sites have good deals too.
2012,4,"I bought 2 tickets for less than what one was going to cost by planning early, being patient and using Kayaks fair alert feature. I have recommended it to everyone who mentions the need to make travel plans."
2013,5,"Very clean and intuitive interface. Right features; Perfect for what it's expected to do. Area of improvement: personalization, fare reminders"
2012,5,It is much easier than getting online and look for flights etc. It is faster too. You have all info you need right in your phone screen. I PERSONALLY LOVE THIS APP.
2012,5,This apps is wonderfull. I save a lot of money during my next christmass vacation with my family in us for flight and hotel reservation. Thanks kayak...i love it.
2012,5,Simply the best app ever! Has some great deals with the lowest prices that i couldn't find on other apps. Way to go :))
2012,5,"Helps me to quickly locate lodging options when on the road. Also,  for preplanned trips helps to save money. A must have travel empowerment app."
2012,4,A few bugs but overall a good app for a frequent traveller. Best part is the option to set up notification alerts for the lowest fare between two locations to help choose the best fare option.
2012,3,Small things irritate me like the calendar not including Sept 30 and it not fully resetting from a +1 day search. Works for browsing but can't use it to buy tickets.
2012,4,"Bing kept telling me to wait, the price will go down.  Never happened!  At least kayak gave me the best price and booking was easy."
2012,4,"Great app! I'm from venezuela, it works really nice.. needs to fix some bugs but other than that.. awsome app recommended"
2012,2,"Everything worked well until I looked at something on the map. Bing maps is so incredibly terrible. Bad choice, Kayak."
2012,4,Works as intended most times. At times when there is a flight delay it won't show as this or  updated. Otherwise it's great!
2012,5,Looks nice. Functions well. Get a free kayak account to help keep track of all your flights. Never have had to write a single thing down after getting this. It's made my traveling life so much easier
2012,5,"Super easy way to manage all travel aspects of a trip.  Love the maps to locations (ie. hotel, etc.)."
2012,5,"Filters are great feature, most major airlines, cars, and hotels.  Love the remember latest search feature.  Tons of international."
2012,3,"Would be nice to have actual hotel location phone #s, also making flight searches time specific. Redeye options search would be handy"
2012,2,HTC LTE travel dates keep reverting themselves or they don't stay the same. Results don't show flexible dates. Very disappointed.
2012,4,"It doesn't have all of the features a easily accessible as the site, but the search options are super easy to use, once you figure out where they are."
2012,5,"It isn't an app I always keep on my phone, but if I'm planning a trip, it is one of the main ones I use. Like the trips option."
2012,5,"It's quick to get the best deal. No hassle, no continued searches. One place to get the best travel deals."
2012,4,First time user. Find it few notches above others that i used to use. Really good and very intutive.
2012,5,"I love this app. Its fluid, finds the best price. And the filtering features are amazing. I recommend it fosho!"
2012,4,One of the best travel apps. For intl. travel needs more options for travel from Central Asia.
2012,5,Love this app. One stop for airlines ticket shopping. The app is extremely user-friendly too.
2012,4,I use Kayak website a lot and therefore expected similar functionality with app as well. I fly with a child and there is no option to specify if second traveler is a child
2012,5,Very impressed with the user experience. Even complex searches are effortless on mobile.
2012,5,"Great way to find fights, but I still use my travel agent. That way I get the flight range I want, the agent gets me the best price, even sometimes better then can be found online. I also do not pay extra for the agent."
2012,5,Absolutely love the rate alert feature. Automatically searches and notifies you of the results. The chart keeping track of the price differential is a nice addition.
2012,5,Excelent application for travel and flight options.  Prices are cheaper than other similar search engines.  Definetly recomend this app.
2012,4,I recently have problems getting results and it seems to stop at 99% of the search results.   Otherwise it is a great tool to get an overview on tickets
2012,4,Not 5 stars just because I want more of it. Would be Great tp be able to Keep journal of What you did on vacation.
2012,4,This app is great for checking flight status and shopping when you have an exact day/time for travel. I wish there was a way to get the fare calendar on mobile.
2012,5,Great app allows you to add and edit packing list as well as detailed flight information. You can also book a car rental and hotels love love love this app!!!!!!
2012,4,"It's definitely a nice way to always carry your itinerary information with you, and the process of uploading new trips couldn't be easier. I just hope you fix the issue whereby the app considers some upcoming trips as past trips."
2012,4,Does everything I need.  Great app.  Any chance future releases will also go out to low cost carriers I.e. southwest?
2012,5,This is a fantastic app for keeping track of your reservations and flight info. Even updates you when times change.
2013,4,I whish we could add information like being a student and add the ' my dates are flexible' option. But is a good app.
2012,4,"Usually the site I use for all my traveling. I just just don't like the fact that if you keep on searching, eventually the price goes up...."
2012,5,So convenient to use! Love that you can make the search flexible within a few days (arrival and departure dates).
2012,5,Way easier than sorting through other travel sites. Thanks! Wish list: book directly from app!
2012,4,I like that I get several quotes for the room and the total cost for the duration plus taxes. Makes finding a hotel that much easier!
2012,5,Giving same experience as desktop browser. Working fine. Good job
2012,5,Works just fine. Has all options the a travel search has. Work great for me.
2012,2,"one vital thing missing. u cant choose an area or country, u hav 2 choose specific airports.               g"
2012,4,Amazing app highly usable and reliable! Wish it had the chart as it does online giving you the estimated round trip prices throughout that traveling month before you click search but otherwise great app
2012,5,"Every time i have to buy plane tickets. I always use kayak, the only thing i wish they would do is have a package of hotel, plane and car rental."
2012,4,Works well majority of the time. Wish they add their package options as a part of the app.
2012,3,"Great app, but lacks some of the functionality of the main website. Important if you are parents wanting to book flights and travel with children."
2012,4,"I always start planning my trips with Kayak. So far, so good."
2012,4,"Love the app. I just wish i can narrow search by indoor pool, and etc."
2012,5,"It's not easy to make an app like this one that works on the smaller phone screen, but this one is useful on the qHD screen of my HTC Sensation."
2012,4,I use this app all the time to search for flights. You can filter all your search criteria and it always comes up with the best deal.
2012,5,This works great. Just as good as the web version. Super quick searches.
2012,4,Excellent and convenient. Didn't quite have the same flexible options as on the web or Blackberry version.
2012,4,Planning a family trip to Maui and love being able to track fare updates on my phone!!
2012,5,"LOVE this app, great interface, all the tools I need, great operation with nary a glitch."
2012,5,Extremely happy. Seems to work well. Will test on my trip to Thailand. Thanks
2012,5,I love how I can just go on my phone to find airline tickets. This app is always up to date.
2012,4,Its a really good user friendly app. It does freezes after I use it for a while though.
2012,5,Excellent application. Not very handle (because small) icons on flying tracker. But in all it is very good app and service. Great job
2012,5,Works good on galaxy tab. Easy to use!
2012,1,Gives a fare price that redirects you to airline or third party sites. The fares are always higher than what Kayak gives.  Waste of time.
2012,4,Great app. Easy to use. I love the filtering and alert options.
2012,5,"accurate, easy to use, and it's free. other apps would say they're free but failed to mention that they're only free for the first few searches."
2012,2,The app is good - quick and convenient - but it's missing the option to choose multiple arrival it departure airport options.
2012,3,"Seems full featured, but I've often found it unaware of flight delays. Even after the scheduled departure time."
2012,4,I'm a AAA member and eligible for car rental discounts but there is no prompt for that information from me.  This app is a C+
2012,4,This app is a very helpful and handy way to look up flights. Wish the fare watch would keep your filters and give alerts based on those.
2012,4,Good app. I knew of the website before so this just made it more convenient for me. This app is straight to the point and easy to navigate.
2012,5,I was searching for the cheapest fly. And with its notification app I got one when it was right were i wanted to spend for a ticket fare.
2012,3,Alright app would be a 5 star if it would let me book my flight it won't let me put in DOB or gender. : /
2013,5,This app is great for on the go travel plans. I love all the filters it has for booking a flight it gets very specific so you don't have to look at flights that won't work for you.
2012,2,Doesn't refresh when trying to change parameters after install search. No info on some hotels all other sites have in Ireland.
2012,4,"I'm going to be using this app a lot for my travel planning. Thanks, guys."
2012,4,Able to access flight info quickly.  Easy to use & able to change search options quickly
2012,4,Like how u can directly book. Good query features.
2012,5,Real-time flight prices at your fingertips where ever you are. Best of all this app saves your recent searches so all you need to do is click search!
2012,1,Tried making reservations.  Failed after being very slow.   Fix it guys.
2012,5,Very useful. Save me for a lot. Thanks.
2012,1,It doesn't work properly. Screen needs to fit. Not useable when flight tracking
2012,5,Love the flight tracker and gate info. Awesome to find pubs in any airport I'm in!
2012,5,Easy to use.  Accurate.  Book it on your Phone.
2012,5,This good apps and i enjoyed it many information hotels and flight tickets. Thx
2012,4,Very impressed. Easy to use. Thanks Kayak!!!
2012,3,"Not bad, however, it needs option to select all airports in one country, or to give option to select which airport should be checked."
2012,5,I LOVe this app. Ibook hotels for my employees frequently. IT also emails the employee their reservations.  SWeet!
2012,5,Appropriate and helpful. I am giving 5*
2012,5,This app is perfect for traveling especially with the check off list and it has the notifications you can turn on to notify you if your flight goes up in price.
2013,5,Easy to use. Find low price options for all kinds of travel needs.
2012,2,Hangs up on flights at 99%. Will wait a few days before uninstalling for a fix. DROID X
2012,4,Would like to see consistent features across all the Kayak apps and desktop version.
2012,5,This is a pretty cool and useful app. Especially if you don't have access to a computer or just want to make plans on the go.

2012,5,Works great. Fast reaults and very easy to navigate.
2012,5,Many useful features. Now using TripIt less and less.
2012,1,"Also, filters don't actually filter anything on Motorola  droid 3"
2012,2,I went to arrange flight and the price changed immediately.  It brought me to the carriers page and it was not offered.
2012,5,Whenever i need to know how much a trip is going to cost me. Its at my fingertips... Wonderful:-)
2012,5,I love this app... When I'm on the road or need 2 get away I start here

2012,5,App is better then using the actual site not bc theres something wrong with the site but bc the apps so awsome.
2012,5,Easy to use and great prices
2012,4,I like being able to pull flight prices so easily from anywhere I have cell service
2012,4,Kayak is super convenient. I can check flight prices from anywhere and anytime.
2012,3,The air fare alerts won't let me select airports
2012,4,I really like all of the choices and the alert options are so helpful!

2012,5,This app is quick and clean. It is a real joy to use and is easier to use than their website because of its simplicity and intuitive presentation.

2012,4,Good app only need to set multiple dates to get the cheaper price
2012,3,It's a good app to have if the others are to pricy or not working properly.
2012,4,Searches most of the major airlines and definitely finds good prices. Allows search filtering.
2012,4,"I would say ""excellent"" if more Airlines are added and the hotel search and prices are excellent."

2012,1,"Airline fees only for US airlines, when setting main currency to CNY all hotels cost above 1 mill/night, cannot add itinerary without creating login. Waiting to see if updates get better. Shows airlines on time even when screen in airport says delayed. Update: not getting better after 3 months, uninstalling"
2012,4,"It'd be great if there was a place to store travel loyalty point information (ie. membership numbers for airline miles, hotel points, etc.) so that it can automatically be provided when booking through Kayak results. Even better, it'd be great to be able to add this information simply by forwarding the enrollment confirmation email, much like Kayak permits with itineraries! That aside, I am really happy with the app design: sleek, simple and intuitive user interface; useful information; multiple methods of"
2012,2,This app is only good for price alerts and it doesn't do multi city alerts. It tells you to do multiple one way alerts. It won't do multi date range. So I now have six price alerts for one round trip. I might as well just set an alarm on my phone to look it up myself once a week.
2012,1,"Airlines are US only and tons of large ones missing eg easyjet. Terminal maps dont tell u where anything is, they just list the shops etc. Out of date eg no giraffe cafe at gatwick which had been there ages. Prices in dollars only. All in all, next to useless outside of the US."
2012,4,"Search history is a good feature, but changing flight dates is giving me difficulties	I like the search history feature for flights, albeit it is difficult to locate in the app. However, it appears that sometimes older dates (not the most recent search for a given itinerary) are remembered in the search history and it is difficult to get the app to 'forget' the old dates and replace them with more recently searched dates. Also, would be better to show the dates of the flights in the search results, particularly when conducting a +/- 2 day search. Currently the date of the flights can only be viewed by clicking on each individual flight."
2012,1,"I've tried 18 times now, not lying to you, 18 FRICKIN times, to look for a flight, and the load bar gets to 99% and freezes. My internet is at 6 bars. (full) My 3G is working. My facebook/browser is working. I've reset my phone, TWICE. Fix this bullshit, oh my god!"
2012,3,"Quite handy to use but lacks some features from the web version... Would love to have the option to switch destination directions as in ios app, and also select flexible dates for multi destination trips Nearby airports results and rosco date results don't seem to include the right/ complete results Stake results in general is a problem with these sites I hate the most though"
2012,1,"On latest version according to my phone but went from a great and reliable app to useless as of the last time I updated. Most searches either pull up no results (message says ""No flights/hotels/etc found"") or searches progress indefinitely with no results appearing."
2012,4,"Good app that does not require an account with them to use the app. If you could include bus and rail tickets/reservations and automatically import travel itineraries from Gmail and Microsoft Exchange accounts, that will make this app the go-to travel app for everything. The flight tracker doesn't track international flights on the map."
2012,5,Why pay $49 a year for a Tripit Pro account when you can have Kayak for free!	I initially installed the free Tripit app but soon discovered that the features were pretty minimal unless you pay to upgrade. I don't travel for work and don't travel enough personally to justify paying $49 a year to organize my travel plans. I was pleasantly surprised to discover Kayak now offers this very helpful tool for free! I especially appreciate that you don't have to buy tickets from Kayak to use this app for organizing your trip!
2012,4,"I just did a search for airfares and the app asked for a departure date and an arrival date, when I think they mean departure date and RETURN date.  Otherwise the app works fine at telling me the available fares.  Regarding car rental searches, it would be nice to be able to search for specific discounts such as for AAA members."
2012,5,"A great tool for those of us that are always on the move. I downloaded the app just to try it out,now I can't live without it;the app not only helps me schedule my flights, rent a vehicle, and make a hotel reservation, It saves me money and time,everything a small business owner like me looks for. I strongly recommend this app, you won't regret it."
2012,5,"I travel quite a bit for both business and pleasure, and Kayak has helped me make arrangements for so many trips, I can't imagine not having it. I've used a few other apps in the past, but none compare to the organization, efficiency, and user friendliness of Kayak."
2012,3,"Great for keeping track of flights and hotels, but would love a few more options in the trip section like being able to delete certain parts of it or even the entire trip. A nicer interface in the trip section would be nice too! Would be easier to read."
2012,1,"I love the layout of the app, but once you click book it the next pages usually errors out or you have to re enter everything only to find higher prices. Again I want to love this app but I can't."
2012,4,"I feel like kayak hasn't changed enough since it first came out and the competition is doing things that they haven't yet. They need to start thinking about how they can meet the needs of each type of traveler with multiple products or multiple views/functions within the same product. Overall though, it still does the job and is reliable. I see the room for growth here, why can't kayak? Check out what the smaller Web sites like hipmunk are doing."
2012,4,"Offers much more than TripIt in the free version, but still an awkward widget and some missing features away from the final star. Can't add trips directly to my calendar while tons of other sites can."
2012,5,"One of my favorite apps for Android.  Easy, fast, &  accurate.  Well rounded feature set.  It's not perfect, but give the devs a few more rev cycles.  This one will be staying on my phone and going on the tablet."
2012,5,"I travel a lot for both business and pleasure, including international trips. This app is perfect for check in reminders and flight/gate changes while traveling, as well as tracking flights for myself and colleagues/family. Thanks Kayak!"
2012,1,"Experienced three nationalities (at least) all adhering to ""protocol"".  Got to sleep on a beach (one night) until I was able to resolve problem next day.   Will not buy anything from Kayak again.  Ruined vacation."
2012,4,"Reviews on hotels are not coming up and sometimes I see a flight that is listed as a lowest fare, I click on it and there is no flight at that cost. The airline providers should be expanded as well for better options."
2012,4,"Would be perfect if the app captured every piece of your itinerary that is purchased through the website.  Unfortunately, it often redirects you to another site to complete a purchase, and when that happens, it doesn't save the item in ""My Trips"".  You can add it easily by emailing the confirmation to trips@kayak, but this shouldn't be necessary in a perfect world."
2012,5,"Great app! Simple as it should be, gets the job done like no other in the field. Now I can always be shipping for the dates I want and get the best deals at a touch of my galaxy s2.way to go kayak!"
2012,1,"Why is the option ""London (all airports)"" for location selection gone? Using the ""nearby"" checkbook does not deliver results from all London airports. Try e.g. LCY and nearby option = no STN"
2012,5,"Only gripe: can't share itineary with other app users.  IE my wife and I are going on vakay, I have added a trip from the app, but she can't view the same trip in her app.   Please add this feature!"
2012,5,"Kayak is so easy that, at first, you may think that something's wrong. Go ahead and verify information and quotes independently; it will only show you that Kayak gets it right the first time. A nice and welcome surprise in this day and age. Thanks Kayak"
2013,4,I really only use it for flights but it works fast and easy to filter the results. Sometimes it'll get stuck at 99% while searching though. But re submitting the flight info fixes it
2012,5,Works better than I expected and then some.  Really like the ability to search +/- 1 day for arrivals and departures.  I prefer this one over the orbitz app. You won't be disappointed.
2012,2,This app is great for quick search for your tour plans but crashes frequently and is very unstable. Needs more filters and tools to search properly. Bottom line: good app but you'll find yourself redoing the reach from the website on your pc
2012,1,"This app used to be the best until they required u to sign up for an account before u can search for flights. Wow, just trying to make money off our data. Thought u were better than that, kayak"
2012,4,Can do a lot of comparisons but doesn't seem to always get the lowest price from some airlines. A great tool to begin you're search!
2012,3,Network fails for me. Good example of revenue model for an app methinks. Doesn't have open ended destination and date search for flights like sky scanner. Hopefully that might change one day and we could have something where the price don't change when you click on them
2012,4,Pretty thorough and accomidates for pretty much any logical search pattern. Keeps previous search on record which is more benefit then bothersome. Helped me find a place in new york for a couple nights. Worth the download if you travel ever so often in a year
2012,3,At first I'm super amazed with the app but not after the latest updates. I get annoyed with the display on my Galaxy Tab. Please fix it.
2012,5,Best features and superb detailed reports of flights hotels and more. I made me uninstall trip it and flight tracker coz its that good at doing it all! Great price sourcing as well.. Fantastic!
2012,4,"But I can't ever find a ticket at the lowest price they say they've found. I do get good deals, however. EVO 4G LTE."
2012,5,"Best go to app for everything flight related! I can track family members flights through my phone, book flights, car rentals, and more using one app. Amazing I have this on my iPad and iPhone as well. Best app hands down!"
2012,4,"Great app but the last version had a great feature called ""Buzz"".  Allowed you to see what the best price by month you can get to a location.  Otherwise great for those looking to travel."
2012,4,"Easy to use fast, lots of options. I love it and highly recommend it. 4 star because I got a few force closure but that my be my phone and not the site who knows."
2012,2,Have been loving the app until last update.  Can't seem to access all features on my phone.  Hope this gets fixed soon.
2012,5,"Very user friendly, I can save my itinerary and get price alerts when the prices drop, does exactly what it says. I'm very happy with the app altogether! LG G2x."
2012,1,I use to love this app but now every time i go to search for a flight it says no flights found. It doesn't just happen once it happens with every single search. I even uninstalled and re-installed. Just ugh :(
2012,5,"I prefer using the app on my tablet versus using the site on my desktop, the app doesn't open a ton of windows and is quick to search. Found some great deals."
2012,5,"One of the most useful apps for frequent flyers. Used it to plan a trip to Europe, New York and Chicago. Flight status feature is better than United's."
2012,4,I find Kayak to be one of the better travel aggregaters. I especially like the email alerts regarding prices. Nothing fancy - it just works.
2012,5,"1. Great email notification of ticket price change 2. Unlike other sites, you can create milti-leg trips 3. Smartphone app is as fully featured as desktop site"
2012,4,Everything good except flight tracker/ price alert widgets! I need those to steal cheap flights to see my long distance partner rather than do full on search.
2012,5,The search and display. The only problem is more kayak then app. Has stale no longer existing ticket options that linger for days making it challenging to find the true remaining deals
2012,4,I haven't yet booked but the searching has been easy. The inly reason it is not 5 stars us because i couldn't figure out how to add an infant passenger. Otherwise everything's all good.
2012,5,Natively coded so it isn't a terrible iOS port. Flights search for tickets is fast and easy. Calendar date selection is a little jittery and glitchy though
2012,5,"Great app.. Accurate, super helpful! Booked my flight, hotel& car rental! Loved being able to get in contact with the hotels& car rental places just by selecting the option to call! Definitely recommend!"
2012,5,I'll never use Travelocity or Orbitz again. Kayak's app is so easy to use. All the options are right where you need them so you don't have to go digging.
2012,5,This by far one of the best app  I have come across in this category.   It has all the feature u might need when you travel.  Must for frequent travellers.
2012,4,Built in packing list is a great feature! App is very fast and well designed. The only thing I wish it had was train schedules.
2012,4,"Works similarly to website functions (oddly turned up better deals than the exact same itin search on the website, that is nice) but has shown some instability (freezes); improved and widened search filters approaching the website would also be nice."
2012,5,Very helpful Counter person. Gave us a deal on a bigger engine in a larger car for more power in the mountains. We had a 4 cylinder. Performed wonderfully over high peaks.
2012,4,Kayak has a very robust mobile app. It definitely works well. I'd love to see more flexible search options in future.
2012,1,"The app won't return any results (it freezes when it hits 99% and then says ""weak signal, search failed"", even though I have full bars and am running on 4G).  Did the same thing 6 times I tried.  Worthless."
2012,5,"Definitely a must have if you plan on traveling. User friendly and would recommend to anyone. I would like to see flight specials of the day though, that would be nice."
2012,1,Select all your trip details then transfers to a airline site And can't process the payment. Seriously think about usability. Deleting after I review.
2012,1,trying to find a hotel close to Disneyland but only searches the whole city. search does not even show the hotel amenities so you can't discriminate between each hotels feature to make a good decision on the hotel.
2012,4,Tried to find hotel deals using this app and I would click on a highlighted rate only to find the rate is actually more expensive. But it is nice to have everything organized on my phone.
2012,4,"I love this app because it makes shopping for flights very easy. It's a lot better than the priceline app and the orbitz app. The only problem I have with it is that it is glitchy. I have to force stop it sometimes to get it to work. It can be frustrating, but it still the best app I have used to search for flights."
2013,3,"Good overall impression, but scared by it's size.  Flexible flight dates (+-2 days) didn't work for me."
2012,4,"Works well, I've used it for a flight and hotel stays. Flights seems to disappear, but I think that's due to the nature of the business not the app"
2012,5,"My family was on a two week road trip vacation.  I used  Kayak to find the flights, car rentals and the hotels.  The ability to switch between map and list mode on my tablet is excellent."
2012,5,This app is easy and fast for booking anything from last minute to family vaca. It has been a great tool for me and I have not had any problems with force close or my bookings while using on my LG.
2012,5,I love this app. Very ready to use and find good deals on flights. Rarely can I find anything cheaper on the web. Keep it up!
2012,5,I like this app very much. It's very reliable. I am a limo driver and flight info is very crucial for my work. My favorite feature this app is that it allows multiple flight info stored at the same time and one can flip through them
2012,4,"I would rate it a 5 but I've only been using it a short time so ill leave some room for error. So far, so good!"
2012,1,"Worked fine for weeks, now won't find any flights even after re-installing etc. Super annoying.  Loved the app before it glitched out!"
2012,5,Great to have one place to find and book cheap flights.  App works excellent.  No bugs so far.  All flights booked were seamless.
2013,5,"It's so user friendly. Best traveling app at the palm of your hands. Definitely gonna book a fight, hotel,and car rental on here for my next trip!;)"
2012,4,"Love it. Works great! Really like the graphics, color and features like currency convertor, reminder list"
2012,5,Like the included flight tracker. That is awesome. Pls add trip cost tracking like in tripit. Also found some weirdness when importing multi hop/jaw flights via email. Kayak cannot see the o/d airport but the description detail for the flight is correct
2012,4,"Great app! Not always up to the minute with deals, but is certainly very helpful in finding them."
2012,5,"Not the greatest UI, but it gets the job done quickly and efficiently.  Wouldn't travel without it.  Great on price alerts, too."
2012,4,"Love it Sometimes wont load searches, but if I go out and then open it up again it seems ok.  Minor glitch. DROIDX"
2012,3,Missing all the top UK budget Airlines. In the current economic crisis this is a big let down. I think the app is more American bias. For UK flights I use skyscanner.
2012,3,I tried to search for flights to Oslo. Every time I do it forces it closed. I have tried other destinations and it worked fine. Annoying bug please fix!
2012,4,"Could make better use of real estate on 1280x720 phones like my galaxy nexus, but it does the job okay..."
2012,5,Does what it says BUT you get different rates for EXaCTLY the same trip online. Maybe this has a built-in upcharge for the convenience of shopping mobile. Should also have better traveler breakdown when incl children/infant just as it does on their full site
2012,4,Great app I must say. I love the multi city flight search. Search results are delivered timely with loads of options to choose from. Thumps up.
2012,1,"I looked at prices for me and me 2 yr old to fly along with my infant son. So 2 tickets I needed, the prices come up but it only shows you the price.for one ticket. Grr aggrevated"
2012,4,Aggregates travel info and saves time. Mostly consistent fares but sometimes not exactly as shown on the specific carrier website. All and all a very useful app.
2012,4,Not bad needs a better push update for price drops. Havent recieved one yet. Good interface overall
2012,5,Worked great till recent update but now no trips visible. Sort it out please - I loved this app. :-( Galaxy S
2012,4,This app works well. Hotels portion has saved me a couple of times. Unfortunately not all air carriers are able to be searched.
2012,1,Placed in flight that my family was boarding so that I can track arrival time. This app stated the flight arrived at destination while it was boarding!!  Really?
2012,4,I book quite a few flights to the Caribbean from the Midwest. Having this app has made it so much easier. The only downer is that somehow the dates keep changing when the final flight is booked.
2012,4,Lacks the ability to flex search an entire month for flights.  Runs perfectly on galaxy s iii
2012,5,"Just started using this app, but it has already booked the right room for us at the right rate. Exited to use the other features fully!"
2012,5,"Excellent app with surprising features. Besides smart flight searching I really enjoyed the flight tracker, push notifications etc. Must download if you are going to fly!"
2012,5,Love using this app. The interface is nice and clean. And works very well. A star in an otherwise lackluster collection of apps in the android world.
2012,4,The trip and flight status part is pretty good. Free as well. Need to improve airline and hotel search to take into account seasonal offer. Most times cheaper to book direct on airline website.
2012,4,Pretty user friendly. But i guess the only thing missing is flexible date choice. Would be perfect if it had been.
2012,4,"And easy to modify fight needs, plus even lets u compare to Expedia. Great ability to choose multiple destination points.."
2012,3,Uses bing maps and has no way to copy hotel address. Cannot make it give directions from where I am to hotel.
2012,5,"I use it to find flights on my HTC amaze. It works perfect, is simple to use, will search by country and importantly, finds great prices for flights all around the world."
2012,5,Runs smooth on my galaxy s. Has a lot of potential for more busy travelers. Just a great tool.
2012,5,"I like how easy it is to Search, Sort, and Filter. Makes narrowing down your Tickets and Prices way easier thanks to this App. :)"
2012,5,It's fast and simple. It always works and I prefer using Kayak on my phone over any site on a desktop or laptop.
2012,4,"One can get good prices on flights and  also the app provides certain other helpful features , although  I am not sure if price alert works in india . Still overall a good app to have ."
2012,5,Really helpful to arrange my schedule... Even for the flight that TripIt can't recognize but you can! Keep it up. And very useful tofind places from various good web
2012,5,Great application.  The improvements have been significant and very useful. The flight tracker feature is excellent. The checklist for travel is very good.
2012,5,"Prices compared well to direct searches, and Kayak gave me the most flexibility of any flight finder in filtering the flights found. Only hesitations are I couldn't see a way to try a different day without redoing my search. And the reminder emails seem to reach me once I'm on the plane."
2012,5,This was my first search on Kayak. It was very easy to use and the information is very complete. I give it 5 stars. I will definitely use it again.
2012,5,I use this app daily.  It's quick.  Easy to use and see options for travel regardless of how complicated travel plans might be.   Love it
2012,3,Filters have to be reset for each search.  Set once and forget would be better.  Now it won't open after posting this rating.
2012,5,The Kayak app is just as accurate as the desktop version and simple to use. When you travel. as much as I do it helps to have tickets at your fingertips!
2012,5,I never use kayak on my computer.  Buy on my phone this is my favorite app for hotel an air....bery vell design
2012,5,i always use the apps to get cheap tix for flights! easy to use and user friendly.. hippi kaye!
2012,4,Works as advertised but not as flexible as the website. Good for portability and convenience. Prices and number of options is helpful.
2012,5,KAYAK is by far the best search tool for flights. I haven't tried the other features yet but I like what I see.
2012,5,This is a great app. But one of the best features is that you can email your itineraries to it and it will keep track of them.
2012,4,"If you like having easy access to your travel data, you'll love this app... but if you feel like you can keep it all in your head, good luck with that too. For me, this app is a 'must'!"
2012,4,"the app is quick, works well, but is missing the ability for  users to select the currency to be displayed. this is a must for users outside the US."
2012,5,I use this mostly for my trips (normally booked on other sites) and the flight tracker.  It is a great app for that...  and it has the bonus that you can search and reserve if needed.
2012,5,My sister and i reached 2 min late to JFK and could not board a delta flight. Contacted the nearby delta booking counter for booking earlidst and cheapest available flight. Their system could not find a suitale flight where as Kayak found. I showed them the flight details and they booked it for me.
2012,5,This app is great! It works perfectly and is time efficient. You can find the cheapest of anything when it comes to traveling. So worth it!
2012,5,Excellent application for the person who travel 80% of the time. It's also great for the traditional traveler. Don't know what I'd do with out it. Keeps my iteniary in order.
2012,5,Best deals in a heart beat. Nice clean intuitive design. Way better than competition.
2012,4,"I would give it 5 stars if it would stop glitching sometimes and give me no flights. But besides that this things is amazing, everything you need for the trip planning is here...except attractions ...so how bout it?"
2012,3,"This app gives a ""weak signal"" message and won't work even when other apps work fine (slowly, but fine). Crappy Sprint network + Kayak = no workie."
2012,5,More information. Easier to use. This is now my preferred travel app!
2012,5,I was already using it on their website but this is much better. It is both easy and simple. I don't know about price differences between website and mobile application. Maybe that could be true :(
2012,5,"I am on the road alot,  and rarely stay in the same hotel two nights in a row. Kayak lets me go where work takes me and never worry where I will sleep at night. Saving money the whole time."
2012,4,The best part about the Kayak website is the calendar of flight cost function. I miss that.
2012,1,"Uninstalled within 5mins, tried searching for flights, loads up to 99% then says ""weak signal, search fail"" dispite having my WiFi in my home on! Stupid app, might as well do it on my laptop"
2012,1,"So far, no good. Keep doing a search for car rentals for later today and it can't find any rates."
2012,5,"Within seconds of starting to use this app, I was tracking flights, viewing flight info, checking available flights, all with just intuition as my guide. The graphics are simple but effective. This sets the standard for free apps."
2012,4,Live update of flight info not working for a lot of airports (airline apps much quicker to update) but many other hateful features
2012,5,Unlike Trippit- you can send ANY confirmation email to kayak. If their system cant figure it out- they have someone review it and they manually add it to your itinerary manually. I've tried them all and this is the best travel organizer app.
2012,5,"Haven't booked a flight via the app yet, but the UI is clean, functional."
2012,4,For someone that travels a lot This is the perfect tool to do that. Worthy of  5 stars if it had travel packages then it would be Wonderfulllllllll .
2012,5,Very easy to use.  Results even easier to analyze than full kayak site.  Only improvement I would like to see is to be able to enter kids as passengers.
2012,5,Better than the website which I thought wasn't possible.... It's the only site I would like to use for travel due to it's efficiency but if prices are chapter else where then.... Good example of how an app should work
2012,5,Very quick and easy to use! Just as easy or easier to pull up app on my phone than it is to sit down at a computer and use the website!
2012,5,"Brilliant app, looks amazing and has do many features. Build is trip organiser with flight status is so useful."
2012,4,This app works very well. It allows many different options to customize searches.
2012,4,"Easy to use, great for a quick flight search when you are on the go. I like the price alert feature!"
2012,4,works well if you remember to choose + - 2days. airlines like transat do not show up
2012,1,I used this site to book a room quick and found out that I paid more than $25 extra for the room with no chance of a rrefund. Call the hotel direct before you buy through this app.
2012,4,Lots of options and easy to use. Like it almost as much as the full website but it's easier to get to as an app.
2012,5,"Awesome app for flight searches. Easy to use and very informative. Things like airport information, sorting if flights are really cool"
2012,5,This guys are awesome indeed. This is the best place to find thhe best deal on the internet. Keep up the good work.
2012,2,"Added a trip two years out by mistake (Kayak's, not mine). No way to delete which means it sits in my upcoming trips list and irritates me!"
2012,4,Lags on loading flights at 99%. Have to constantly re load. Motorola RAZR M
2012,3,"Not a bad app, i travel a lot but have to go through my corporate travel desk. This app helps me give them direction on best flights for me as far as times and dates..."
2012,4,I've purchased airline tickets using this app. Very simple to use. Very good looking app. Can't comment on the rest of it though since I only used it to purchase airline tickets.
2012,5,I have been using Kayak for a couple of months to check on flight costs for an upcoming vacation.  The app performs well and lists a great comparison of flights.
2012,4,"I wish it had the ability to search for flexible flight dates like the website does! Otherwise, a good app for finding the cheapest and largest selection of flights and hotels out there."
2012,5,"What can I say it works as interested, it save me time and the best part is that it save me MONEY. :-) You should try it."
2012,5,"I never have luck with these types of sites, but after using this for 5 minutes have flights planned at an awesome rate!"
2012,2,"A flight from Perth to Brisbane return comes in at $2177.what moren xomes up with that. Used to be a good app,but now not so sure."
2012,5,"This tool beats everything else available.  There are  one or two that provide the same features, but they also charge monthly subscription fees."
2012,5,"Superbly optimised for Android. Super fast with flights, hotels and cars from anywhere to anywhere in the world."
2012,5,This site should've been made a lonnnnng time ago it gets to be so time consuming trying to search every site for the cheapest rate. Its very easy to do I recommend this for anyone.
2012,5,Great App! I used it in a hotel parking lot in Atlanta and I got a better deal than what they were offering inside.
2012,4,Simple and accurate. Very easy to use and gives you quick results with options to share with others.
2012,5,"Fast, smooth, and easy... almost reminds me of my ex wife.....thanks KAYAK..... Im a big fan!"
2014,5,"I use this app for everything! I've found hotels while on the road, figured out foreign exchange rates and gotten pricing for air fare at the drop of a dime.  Love my Kayak!"
2012,5,"Although, I don't use all features of the app, but I found it very useful to track my flights."
2012,5,I can check up to date flight rates anytime. It's user friendly and even lets you check rates on Expedia.
2012,4,Very useful. Some hotels are missing pictures and there are no ratings for hotels. If there would be auto connection to trip advisor
2012,4,Pretty cool n easy to use...only bad thing is Kayak need to allow booking straight on their syt rather than redirecting. All in all it's alright!
2012,5,I think it's one of the best applications for free on the market. Very impressive and I will using this service in the near future.
2012,4,Only setback is the option of range of times for flights that is available in the full site. Everything else works great.
2012,5,Only used it from the aspect of searching and setting a price alert.  I have been very impressed with the interface and ease of use thus far.
2012,3,Everytime I attempt to open it eventually crashes and finally once I uninstalled and reinstalled half of the text goes of the screen :(  I should have never updated the older version was awesome.
2012,3,"Bought tickets through another company, tried to email my itinerary several times without success...had to type in manually on website, and change times because they didn't update flight changes"
2012,5,"Easy to use, fast and brings up plenty of good options. Love it!"
2012,5,"I have been using Kayak to purchase my tickets home every year and to me it is a lot easier than jumping around to all the ""discount"" sites...yes, I know you can compare all the sites but why bother one site and you're done. I don't bother going to any other sites...this app makes it nice it is on my cell and my tablet,"
2012,4,"Only used briefly but seems fast and straightforward, although prices are show in US dollars which is easily converted! Wish I'd had this app earlier but hasn't heard of it!"
2012,3,Good app. Need to take off fares/prices not actually available. Best on market today......
2012,4,"Nice chunky buttons n sliders, easy to use, mega quick. Impressive memory functions. Get it installed!"
2012,5,"i'm using kayak on web, on ipad and now on my new android tablet.. love it!"
2012,5,Awesome works great on HTC one xl and offers cheap airfares.  Would be even better if it had more airlines baggage policies
2012,5,"Excellent layout, very user friendly.   Love the search memory feature."
2012,5,"Saves searches, airport maps, simple ui, good filter options. An overall wonderful app"
2012,5,This is a very useful app... :)) i like the price update part of every flight.. :DD
2012,4,I'm always on kayak looking for tickets for my sister. I've never booked through it personally.
2012,5,"Great app, but as always do not rely on any one app exclusively. Shop around."
2012,5,Love it! Works great always. I like it better than an actual computer.
2012,5,"Very clean, professional, and always finds good deals. The only way I book flights and hotels!"
2012,4,Would be perfect if it used Google Maps instead of the lame Bing map.
2012,4,First trip added. So far so good. Quick interface. Clean and easy to read.
2012,4,"I like this app so far, very easy to use.  Haven't been able to see if I can book bundle yet, car, hotel, flight as one, we'll see"
2012,5,"This app works like a charm! It's simple, easy to navigate and it provides accurate quotes."
2012,4,I stilk wish it displayed more flight results then it does.   Having said that I must say it's one of the best apps for travellers like myself
2012,4,"Great interface, great results. Just missing a range of dates rather than a specific day for each search"
2012,5,Seemless search before dropping into the airline's version of hell ;)
2012,4,"Awesome app, only thing that would make it better would be the ability to choose departing and returning flights separately as this makes for less scrolling and sifting to find a pair that works for you!"
2013,4,This is quite good app and advicable for those who are planning to travel to a new destination. I like the facility to view the location of the hotels in map.
2012,5,"As a frequent flyer, I adm it that this apps made my life easier. Thanks to apps makers.Please continue."
2012,3,"I like the speed and the convenience of this app, but it seems you can research lower prices from the hotel/rental cars websites."
2013,4,"App works very well, only missing feature for a 5 starer is not being able to request include nearby airports while searching flights"
2012,5,Very good app and very useful for traveller..easy to use and quick search result. I love this app.
2012,5,Easy to navigate. Best prices. good features such as price alert
2012,5,Works like a charm only thing i did not find is an alert option but maybe it's me....
2012,3,"Need lil improvement like option to select currency type i.e. INR, USD, CNY etc Cheap prices are sometimes not coming in the list ..."
2012,5,Nice spread of deals.  Easy interface.  Intuitive search and filtering.
2012,5,I never plan a trip without kayak! It manages my flights and reservations as well as makes them. Awesome!
2012,5,"If you travel & have a smart phone, you'll love this app. It's simply awesome."
2012,4,"The app and trop planner service is great, but the one thing I don't like is the inability to add or change trips from within the app"
2012,4,i travel alot and this has made finding and booking flights SO EASY! i love that it remembers my cities...
2012,5,I like the packing list option! It help me remember to pack important things into my traveling bag.
2012,4,"Quick, intuitive interface. There should be more useful filters though."
2012,3,Red   Easy to use but redirect to other websites inconvenient and round about. Find myself often searching myself on the sires kayak provides.
2012,5,"The app seems to have all the amazing functionality of the website, but for my phone. Hooray!"
2012,5,Found rock bottom deal on a las vegas flight. This ap p rocks.
2012,5,Then this app will help you in every way! It checks all travel companies so I've gotten the best price every time!! A++++
2012,1,I'm pretty sure that rental cars are available at Orlando airport. App says no. I'd say it doesn't work.
2012,4,Great interface. Filters are useful. Well done.
2012,4,but it doesn't read Chinese confirmation.  I have to use google translate to translate the iten before forwarding.
2012,1,"uninstalled. Just too unreliable now. Wrong flights, incorrect emails...simply too many bugs."
2012,5,Very good for pricing flights..... Orbitz app is junk compare to kayak..... Never crashed so far every thing I looked for flights is perfect. Domestic and international.....
2012,4,"Good travel search program, only downside is the inability to set up price alerts for multi city flights...also force closes randomly."
2012,5,"I love this app! Easy interface, quick results, best prices on flights and hotels."
2012,5,"Couldn't be easier. Hotels, car rentals, flights... all there. Easy to navigate. Awesome app, a must have for travel planning!"
2012,4,Grrrrreat app! Allows me to check flights quickly & get updates on a certain flights to email.
2012,5,Works great!! I only use this app when flying... It saves lots of time
2012,5,Never thought that planning a trip and buying tickets could be done on an android within a matter of minutes.
2012,1,Requests fail almost every flight lookup on my HTC one x...all following requests after a fail progress to 99% and then do nothing...
2012,5,"Have been using for airline tickets, hotels and rentals. Always finds the best deals."
2012,4,"Flight booking is great. Flight tracking, hotel booking, airport maps mediocre."
2012,5,"Super user friendly, great interface, great filter options, the only app I'll use to book flights. Love it!!"
2012,4,"This is real stable. I loved the website first, now the app works great."
2012,4,I was able to quickly research hotels for an upcoming trip and found a great rate.
2012,5,The selection screen is very easy. The results are easy to read and the filtering is ultra easy. Even my grandpa would be able to book a flight !
2012,4,Kayak is awesome! Just wish they had the 3 day flex tool for the flights on mobile.
2012,5,give me cheap tickets in less than a min after surfing the internet for deal. please use it

2012,5,"I am satisfied, it is not one stop shop, but, even today, we have to do something more than click three times... so, very good"
2012,5,10
2012,5,"Far better than any of the other aggregator apps like priceline, expedia, etc... Easy to use, and always finds the cheapest prices"
2012,5,This app is as useful as the regular site but much handy.  You have other tools not available at thevtraditional site.
2012,4,All I've done so far is search for flights. No issues there. Not sure about the other capabilities
2012,5,"My new standard. Works across platforms, too."
2012,5,My one stop shopping place for all my travel needs. Saves me time & stress!
2012,2,"Meh...  Nice idea but falls short once you try to book. Errors, time-outs, and you have re-enter info"
2012,2,Nice layout but the app crashes every time I try to use it! Needs fixes!
2012,2,All my flights are within Europe and I find skyscanner much better. For example kayak doesn't seem to show prices for ryanair.
2012,5,I travel extensively and always use this app. as my travel tool
2012,4,Good app. Good layout. Really happy with it!
2012,4,Convenient app. Only issue is that price alert notifications don't always work.
2012,5,"I always go to Kayak first for travel planning. I consistently get the best farez/rates and an easy view into alternate dates,/providers."
2012,4,"Not bad at all.  I was not able to specify i have a dog, or i could not figure it out. SrH- Portland, OR"
2012,5,I needes a app that would show the best rate for hotels. Not only do it does that it shows picture and compairsbit rates to some of the top travel sites.
2012,5,"Love the site, love the app. Kayak is how I find all my cheap flights from Thailand to Namibia to local flights to Vegas or Montreal.  Kayak RULES!"
2012,5,"This is a must have app.. I love that you can shop just 1 place for any airlines, hotel and cars it's a wonderful app!!!! It's a must have."
2012,5,We are in the middle of planing for a trip  and I have checked in to most all of the sites and I can tell you KAYAK is by far the best for our needs. Keep up the good work.
2012,5,The app is way better visually than the regular online version and easier to use.
2012,5,Awesome App. It just works. Being able to have so many variable makes it the best.
2012,5,One of the easiest and feature rich fee apps out there.
2012,4,"No fuss, simple and concise. Quick flight scheduling. Ready to read and navigate. What more could you ask for?"
2012,2,Very slow to hip to update making it's use limited.
2012,4,"Please add all the features from the web version, maybe a tablet version?"
2012,4,"Now that I moved to the east coast, this app has come very handy in finding flight for my mom who lives in Cali."
2012,4,"Comes in handy for a quick search. Lots of info, but not always the lowest prices."
2012,3,"If you have kids you still need to go to the full site, no small traveler selection here."

2012,4,Glad that it saves my previous searches. Definitely like this over the travelocity app.
2012,5,One improvement would be to have more budget carriers although I personally don't fly them. But maybe they are not part of the booking software that Kayak and other sites use.
2012,4,"Easy to use, works well. Fast. No complaints :)"
2012,5,Use it several times a month for flights and hotels.  Works great on every device I have
2012,4,I use this app often. Sometimes it forces close when im navigating a long time but other than that its great!
2012,5,There are many functions to use and each are very easy to use in addition to being detailed. Would like better if JetBlue airline was included in search.

2012,5,I like using Kayak because it is fast and user friendly.
2012,5,Phenomenal app!  Super easy to search flights and set up alerts. Expedia hopes that their app will be this good when it grows up!!!

2012,5,Me likely
2012,3,"I installed this app for the MyTrips feature, to compare it to Tripit, which I am also using. While the UI is cleaner and not ad-supported, the app won't load at all while offline. This is terrible, because I need this app in foreign airports and hotels, where I have no internet. Tripit wins hands-down in the regard. If they fixed this issue, I would immediately rate this 5 stars, as the UI is much cleaner and it has parsed emails that Tripit couldn't."
2012,1,"Can't keep the app open, won't let me view picture, try to open maps and this is especially when it can't handle it and shuts down using a simple feature. Getting annoying. I'd rather use the mobile site. Droid x2"
2012,4,"Excellent and convenient way to find all your travel needs! Though a lil difficult to set up price alerts at first... So much easier than using a web site, nice UI, finds deals just as cheap as anywhere else... All around really good app!"
2012,3,Great great app. Only things I'm concerned about is that it crashes my home launcher and I'm not using a 3rd party launcher. Every time I close the app all my icons have to restart. Also the app does not have an option to show all the reviews people put on. Only shows a few. Also it doesnnt show enough pictures. There are more pictures on the actual website of kayak than on the app.
2012,4,"Latest version is awful. As soon as it opens, app displays a message stating that there is no internet connection. When searching for flights, message displayed is ""weak network signal, search failed."" This happens whether on Wi-Fi or cellular data.  Edit: I uninstalled & re-downloaded the app & it seems to be working fine for now."
2012,2,The application works superb.. But when i compareb the prices of Hotels it almost double the actual price. Secondly i did'nt found where i can change currency option. I searched some flights but the price is only in $. So for these above two reasons only 2*
2012,4,"Id like to be able to send addresses to google maps. Also for hotels, why do you show me the room details on the website but not on the droid3 app? I want ALL details! This app is about 90% useful and it does a decent job of holding the itinerary I setup on my desktop pc."
2012,4,"use Kayak for flight searches, and it's fast and reliable. The only thing that I don't like is the long scrolling through many possible timing combinations of one airline's flights. I'd prefer choosing my preferred timing for each leg. Maybe I could customize settings accordingly, but I haven't yet made the effort to find out."
2012,1,Expensive car rentals for Europe. Same car on one site 35€ per day costs $79 through Kayak. Not all airlines available. More expensive ones again. Return flight to Canada $2800 elsewhere costs $3500 through Kayak. Not all hotels available. If you are lazy and don't care about money use this. If you want to save money look elsewhere. You don't have to look too far to find better prices
2012,2,Why direct call phone numbers permission? Malicious apps can make phone calls without users aware. Or Why reading sensitive info permissions? Please remove these requirements and I'll up my rating.
2012,5,"With the latest update, you can easily navigate back and forth to change search parameters. I once was faithful the Orbitz App, but now there is no comparison. Kayak makes it so much easier to find the best deals. Thanks."
2012,5,"The tablet app is much better than the  pc app.  Easy to use, quick, and good options to  down-select to the flights you need.  Even has Southwest schedules (although no costs are shown, but that is OK since Southwest has a great tablet app)  Much better than Expedia or Orbitz"
2012,4,"I was using others travel related apps for sometime, but it was not so interesting. but after started using KAYAK I immediately uninstalled other apps from my instrument. KAYAK IS AN EXCELLENT APPS WHERE YOU CAN ADAPT CURRENCY TO SHOW THE FARES ACCORDING TO PLACE WHERE YOU ARE. THANKS."
2012,2,It was working great the first few days and then it stopped for some reason. It wouldnt update or track plane. After the flight arrived an hour later it still shows its on time and the map shows the plane hasn't even left yet. Undecided..
2012,4,I'm Canadian and use a galaxy S2.  I fly twice a month for work and this app is great.  it doesn't always update most current seat sales with westjet but that's my only complaint.  never booked hotels with app.
2012,5,"The one feature I love, is that if you have already have an itinerary, you can forward your email itinerary to kayak and it will import all of the information into your trips. You don't have to manually enter all of that information. This app is also much more complete that the other ones I have tried."
2012,5,"Such a timesaver. Lets me easily search and sort rental options. Its easy to use, and looks nice too. Haven't had any glitches or crashes in 3 months of using it. *Samsung Droid Charge"
2012,4,"Great app, I had iPhone and I setup price drop notifications and it world fine I bought ticket on good price 5 star for that however since I changed to Android the notifications doesn't work 4 stars not sure if I am the only one who is having this issue. Overall a must have great app."
2012,1,I changed my mind. Several time I tried to book or make connection Rent a Car via KAYNAK I never success. Even I called Avis they laughed me when I told him about the price. After all I uninstall KAYNAK ASAP.
2012,4,"Just got back from vacation in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and this app would update through email if there were any gate changes or any changes at all.  Worked great!"
2012,5,"This is an excellent product.  I use it to keep a daily log of what I do at the job, the hotels I use at the various site, etc.  It syncs between my tablet, computer and phone so I always have the information on hand.  I love it!"
2012,4,"I love the ""all in one place concept"". Kinda helps make a potentially expensive trip a little less daunting.  I look forward to using it more ;)"
2012,4,"Like the app, it works great with my phone. Really user friendly. Would like to be able to save my filter and sort preferences...but still worth the money FREE!"
2012,3,"Great sesrches, booked a hotel for next week right from my phone safely and securely. Downfall crashes quite a bit. Samsung Galaxy S 4G"
2012,1,Filled out all my information and then had no submit button on Asus Transformer TF300T running ice cream sandwich.  Then when I called the hotel direct I got the room for quite a bit less then than app quoted for me.  Makes the app a total failure in my book.
2012,4,Used it a bunch during my roadtrip.  Very easy to navigate through the information.. Not a 5 because it doesn't display real phone numbers for the hotels.
2012,1,This re-routes to add unnecessary layovers. For example SEA to Cleveland has a layover in Philli. I decided to just fly to Philli. It added a layover in Detroit. I figured I would just fly there instead. Added Denver layover. Same thing when I was trying to fly to Green Bay which had a layover in St. Paul... which then had a layover in Phoenix. This App. is fishy.
2012,4,Previously I had to log onto a computer or a laptop to book a flight or check prices online. But this app is plain wonderful making the whole process of travelling wonderful. The only downside was that it needs to have more filters to filter out the right flight from the hundreds of results it gives.
2012,5,I never use another search engine. Kayak does a great job of pulling together flight data from multiple airlines and is very user friendly. I don't know what I did without it in the past!
2012,5,"I've been using Kayak for years on the desktop. Now its on my tablet. Works well, the only problem is that it can't find dirt cheap airfares anymore."
2012,5,"Everything you need for a trip including packing lists, flight tracker, in-flight GPS and tons more. Of course, not to mention the great flight and hotel finder! Fantastic all around app."
2012,4,Loved this app for all my trips & notifications was great on my previous HTC EVO 4g. Just upgraded to the HTC EVO LTE & now no longer shows option of syncing trips to calendar. Please fix!!!
2012,5,It makes trip planning so simple. This app is very user friendly and it allowed me to figure out the best option for a get away. By analyzing travel and hotel prices as well as availability. All in the palm of your hand.
2012,5,"Absolutely love price alert, flight tracker & flight search (with multi city) tools.   Wish it had price push notifications, seat maps to make it really comprehensive."
2012,5,"Brilliant app, makes booking easy, had one force closure but I'm sure it will get ironed out, every time I think 'it should do this' I find the feature! Very well made and thought out."
2012,5,"Went to Battle Creek, Michigan to visit gf family, very dirty and filthy. Kayak saved the day had a hotel in Grand Rapids, Michigan in less than 10 minutes. Thank you Kayak"
2012,5,Always returns no results for the 1st search criteria.please do proper testing!  Add options to add near by airports.  UI IS CLEAN.
2012,4,If you can improve the speed and change those horrible sliders for time selection the you get full give stars.  Its a lot better on the tablet than phone though
2012,4,Great app. Does exactly what it says except for automatic notifications (should advice without going into app). Must have for frequent travelers.
2012,5,"This app is great i love the fact it puts up all the prices of the other sites to help me get the best deal! And ill admit it I check the other sites too,  just to make sure they are right and i am getting the best value for what I'm looking for! THANKS  KAYAK !!!!!!!"
2012,2,"Works well but like with some other apps I have uninstalled, why does it need to read my phone call nfo.and serial number of my phone. Does not need that permission."
2012,5,"It's very easy to use. Good customization options. Nice goodies, like search alerts and in-flight position tracking. Definitely useful, finds excellent deals."
2012,5,Great work done by the team.. Execellent app so many features under one roof. Perfect for frequent business travel people.
2012,1,Made a cross comparison.. Suggestions were extremely overpriced. Maybe not app's fault but their travel partner's. Not gonna use it anyways.
2012,5,It will be great if we can search best fare in a week. The interface is very user friendly. The application feature are exceeding expectation. Price alert feature is amazing
2012,5,"Love this app!!! Makes it easy to plan trips. Finds the cheapest flights for me rather than searching each airline, and finds hotels near the airports. Also love the currency conveyer. Thanks kayak."
2012,5,Bought my ticket using my phone through this app. Easy to use and I like the pricing alert on this app. It alerts you through e mail when ticket price is low to which ever destination you choose. So it made it easy for me to book my ticket.
2012,3,"I used it to surf the different flights offers. Only, with my SONY ERICSSON Neo, it crashes when watching photos of hotels or changing option of searching."
2012,5,"They keep bugging me to rate it so I will.  It really is a very good and convenient app.  I especially like that I can search specific airlines or hotels.  Would be spectacular if a cruise section were added.  Info on bike trails would be nice, too."
2012,5,Super helpful in finding great deals. The alert option keeps me updated on special prices I would have otherwise overlooked.
2012,5,I use Kayak pretty regularly on the web but this seems to have more features than that. Very impressed. (Motorola DROID 3
2012,5,"Accurate, fast, easy-to-use, fantastic filter option. The only thing that would make this app better is a price prediction feature."
2012,2,Works sometimes. It usually won't load all the pictures. It ALWAYS shuts down in the middle of use or brings me back to the start.
2012,4,Create fare alerts and more.  Interface is easy and quasi sleek.  This app has a lot of potential to set the standard for travel apps.
2012,4,"Not as good as using kayak in a browser. My tablet's web browser works better with kayak than the app does. Other than that, it is a great app."
2012,5,Easy to use. Quick. Has so many other features than just a flight search engine! Love it!
2012,3,"Great simple interface.  Needs a little tweaking wigh filters and options.  Very quick, nice clean results."
2012,5,"I constantly use this app if not to book a trip, just to fantasize! Def wish they could get southwest rates too! Or a cheapest flight feature!"
2012,5,Very helpful app! It allows me to check multiple options very easily. I've never had a problem and used it many times.
2012,5,Love Kayak app. So many options on how you want to fly to your destination. It's really easy to use too.
2012,5,"This app is easy to use, and gets you the beat deals! Plus it has other useful features. Cant go wrong with this one!"
2012,4,App does what it's says. Kayak is one of the best of its kind. Thanks and keep up the good work.
2012,5,Works great! Love that you can email your itinerary and it puts everything together into one trip. Very well done!
2012,5,Awesome interface- easier & faster than the computer version. Flexible search options & fare alerts are great features; I wouldn't change a thing.
2012,4,In Android this is very easy to use. On BlackBerry using the multiple cities routing option is a nightmare. I enjoy using Kayak. Good app!
2012,4,"Love it. Having problems going back in days though, won't let me see anything before December...."
2012,5,Used it three times already. Very easy interface. Quick results. Called hotels. Prices were accurate.
2012,4,Ive used other apps .. kayak does an excellent job allowing clients to better customize the results to their needs. Ive flown to many locations using the app and have saved so much $$ .. 4.5 stars!!
2012,4,"Love this app! Quick, easy and succinct! Just wish there were more filter options."
2012,5,My fiance and I are  looking at flight prices for our honeymoon! Kayak makes it so much easier and less time consuming! Thanks!  :-)
2012,4,Excellent app to find prices for domestic and international flights.  Used to crash on my HTC hero but works well on samsang galaxy 2.
2012,5,"Very good interface, reliable and ALWAYS finds the best quotes. Thanks for the great app! Keep up the good work!"
2012,5,"With this and the Southwest Airlines app, you're pretty much set for booking all of your domestic travel. Easy to use and the my trips section is super useful. Just upset that kayak stopped tracking airline miles."
2012,5,Very clean presentation of flight options. Easy to use. I especially like the total travel time and connection displayed in line with the flight.  That feature alone cuts the evaluation time significantly.
2012,5,Very nice app. It is very user friendly. So far I did not find any issue.. Well done
2012,1,Need option to filter flight results. No layover for example. Search for flights and hotels together would be nice too
2012,5,I have not traveled on a plane since 1997. My job is flying me out on a business trip. This app has been helping me get information from flight times to baggage fees and so much more information is available. Within the app you choose the airline to get the info you are looking for and the app will take you to the applicable page on the airline's website for additional information.
2012,4,This app is simple and powerful. Not a bunch of uneeded graphics and fancy do hickeys.  Used it to find two flights on my Transformer Prime. Pretty efficient
2012,2,"Hotel photos rarely load, usually stops at 2nd photo and then force closes. Has done this for past 3 updates."
2012,5,"Quick, efficienct and the most comprehensive travel app. Works perfectly on my Galaxy Tab 2.0."
2012,5,"I've got several travel apps on my Samsung galaxy s3,  and I'd rate this one as being the easiest to navigate. Orbitz would be my next choice."
2012,5,"Works!  (Unlike other apps) Indispensable for the frequent traveller, useful for even the most infrequent."
2012,5,I'm used to using hotwire however. kayak is a lot less expensive. I went to hotwire to rent a car it's  would have cost me 249 dollars on kayak 149 so you tell me can you say bye bye hotwire
2012,4,Would be great application but one minor glitch... flight updates are sometimes a little off. Otherwise OK.
2012,4,"Intuitive interface. Defaults to dollars, bit others available Would like a zoom button on maps view..."
2012,4,"Works as advertised except at times, it is hard to see the search results on my phone because ads consume a large portion of the screen."
2012,4,I like it. It's very user friendly although it refreshes a little too often or it may just be my phone but overall its a great app.
2012,5,"Been using kayak since it was sidestep. It recently got me through a two week europe trip booking everything day-of, on the fly.  Worked every time across 5 countries and 7 cities.  Can't beat it."
2012,5,"Probably through best, most comprehensive tool around. Saved me a huge amount of time and money when needing to book a flight in an emergency..."
2012,4,Still need to improve. The app crashes at times when u try to share the deals with some. Never understood why.
2012,5,Easy to use. Nice emailing feature. Track your flight and whole trip with a free account. I just love it!
2012,5,"This app gives you all the info you need to book anything for your vacation, its one of those apps you shouldn't delete from your phone."
2012,5,Great website. The world wide web has come so far since 1993. Thank you for your services.
2012,5,"Only complaint is that its hard to filter hotel results by location which is a must have when  searching in large cities like NYC, SF, or LA. You can see results on a map but it would be nice if you could select it as a filter option."
2012,4,"This app is simplistic, yet sophisticated. It has a lot of the Kayak features I am used to and is user friendly in my opinion."
2012,5,"Highly recommend. Easy to use interface. A must for travellers wanting instant info on accom. Car rentals, flights etc"
2012,5,Super easy... not as feature rich as tripit.. but way faster to get to your travel details.
2012,5,Only been using for a few minutes but it is so intuitive. Best travel app by far and I've used lots. Must have for anyone wether you're a frequent flyer or once a year holiday person.
2012,5,Easy to use. Realy best deals. Doesn't include some cheap air travel companies
2012,5,"This app saved me a lot of money when I was in a jam and needed to get a quick flight because of an emergency.  Also, I really like the fare alert feature."
2012,5,"Hands down, it's the best app for comparing travel deals, & saves you time by searching so many sites & providers."
2012,5,"Booked one night online, decided to stay a second night and used the app, told the front desk, and continued my stay! Found a room with Kayak even when my hotel's front desk had no availability and at a lower price than other sites!"
2012,5,An all- in-one app for people who are planning to take their next vacation. Saves you time and effort searching for the best deal around.
2012,5,This is one of the best user interface I have seen for a mobile device. Simple and effective.
2012,4,"I hace been using kayak for a whilw, both on the phonr and website, and I am generally happy with it. Finding fight combinations and compare prices when several dates and times would suit you is still painful."
2012,5,"I never waste my time with reviews and stars... However, much they ever want for the app, pay for it! Hard part now is figuring where else to visit in the World...  No room for Desert, im fully satisfied."
2012,5,"I cant complain..... Its fast and help me alot in what i was looking for, pretty easy to used with my SAMSUNG GALAXY SII."
2012,4,This is a Must have for people looking to buy air tickests! It is fast n handy!    Thank you guys
2012,5,I love the 3 plus or minus days option!  And its so quick to use the app versus the browser.  Its great!
2012,5,"I have been planning my trip via KAYAK and I do get really good bargains with it. It is a wonderful app and all these functions: price alert, my trip... They are just very useful :-)"
2012,5,I like it better than Trip Advisor. More straight forward interface and uncluttered presentation.
2012,5,Works flawlessly. I prefer to use this app to using the actual site on my laptop. Good job kayak!
2012,5,"I love having all my reservations in one place. You can track flights, and there are detailed airport maps."
2012,2,It used to be so quick.  Now it lags and refreshes hotel rates every minute-two minutes of browsing.
2012,5,"Much better than expedias app. Expedia let's u search hotels,  kayak let's u search cars, flights, and hotels with the cheapest prices from multiple sites. 5 STARS"
2012,4,"This app is great, I was able to easily monitor ticket prices everyday and get the best rate. Cons: show more airlines."
2012,5,This app is just an extension of a great website. Please fix widget though! Its huge!
2012,4,I truly like searching foe flights.   I think my only complaint is that I can't schedule more than 1 search and let it ping me if it finds below a price.
2012,4,"Up to now no problem, but I want notifications from flight tracking, and price alert... otherwise is useless"
2012,5,"Beautiful app.  So many filter options. Find the best rate anytime, anywhere. So easy to use."
2012,5,Really like the easy interface.  Very simplistic and all the information is delivered fast. Love the price alert option.
2012,5,"Highly recommended this app, easy to use and convenient for me. I can check my flight, hotel and transport everything all in this app, no need to search those websites 1 by 1. Save me a lot of time."
2012,5,Great interface. Works great on s3. Works for Canadian flights and gives you direct dialing to book.
2012,5,"Very streamlined, looks great on tablets as well. The simplicity of the app makes it a breeze to use."
2012,5,"this is one amazing app, simple, elegant and very informative. Thank You. made my life a lot easier"
2012,4,Doesn't notify if the prices came down. No alerts whatsoever on Samsung  galaxy nexus.
2012,5,The only down side is you can't select +/- days. Otherwise a great app. Thanks
2012,2,"App works flawlessly, by unfortunately requires access to calendar and email data - uninstalled as I don't think a booking app requires this level of permissions."
2012,5,Works as advertised. Very nice features. Slick interface. High production values.
2012,5,i it is a nice application for android. it gives me extra privilege on my mobile to search and book the tickets right away. loving it
2012,5,Works very good on my Droid. Easy to navigate and has the best pricing.
2012,5,Great way to keep tabs on flight and rental prices in order to get the best deal. I also enjoy the packing list feature.
2012,5,"Best f*******  deal in town  Thank you much ,cant wait to my trip to reno for 30  .thank u wish i chould stay longer"
2012,4,"Good app, bit could do with currency converter. All prices are in dollars, so you have to try and convert them to your currency...if you know the current rate that is!"
2012,5,"It's simple n ready to use. Very informative, smooth surfing .. great! I'll definitely use it to just check the price even I'm not traveling anywhere. Lol."
2012,5,Easy to use app with quick access to flight info.  Very helpful while traveling especially providing status updates on fligts with multiple legs.
2012,5,This is by far one of the best apps I have ever seen. Its so easy to navigate I prefer the app to the website.
2012,5,"Like Darth Vader would say, ""Impressive""! I actually downloaded it because i saw a funny but useful comment, then i tried it, really nice. Excellenticos!"
2012,5,I've never had an issue with Kayak....works just as well on my Thunderbolt as it does on my home PC.
2012,1,"is great, never had a problem. just tried to use the app for the first time to book a flight and the quoted price nearly tripled, wtf?!"
2012,4,Still easier to use site on a computer since you can see multiple windows and compare more easily
2012,4,"Easy to use whether or not you know all of the airport codes. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND NON-STOP INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS."
2012,5,Very user friendly and functionally easy to use! Fast finder of all discounts...
2012,5,"Awesome all-around app. Clean look and fluid use, with the features you need and want!"
2012,4,"Great app. Very up to date info, friendly with considerable amount of options.Worth recommending to anyone"
2012,5,"Handy app. Works quick, easy to use. Like it"
2012,4,Pretty good for an app.. just wish it would update statuses/ availability a tad faster
2012,5,it is just too good that i am so overwhelmed with its simplicity to use. oh the currency converter is awesome!
2012,5,"Really nice, clean and user friendly interface. I wish more apps were designed thus way."
2012,5,I have used this app since 2007.  IT HAS SAVED ME ALOT OF MONEY AND TIME.  THANK YOU!
2012,4,Easy to use. Fast and simple. Just what I need for my phone.
2012,1,"Doesn't work on HTC One. Can't set filters before a search, setting a filter after the search is flaky at best. Tons a network failures."
2012,4,"Love it! Very handy, altho sometimes it won't populate the airports I have to close app and restart a few times for it to work."
2012,3,good user interface but does not give ALL flight options. Also quoted prices are higher than expedia
2012,5,I love this app. It compares other websites even if their more expensive then the others. It refines things very well and its just all around very helpful.
2012,4,"Great for finding what prices and times will look like, but no way to purchase or bookmark flights for yourself, you can only mail potential to someone... also cant specify times for flights"
2012,5,Didnt believe something like this could be so perfect. Havent used it much but the stuff it could do for you is incredible. Keep it up
2012,5,"Used it to go on my vacation, couldn't believe how easy it was...just make sure to call and confirm and your good to go!  Get this app"
2012,5,"Am a frequent US airways traveler and they don't hav an app yet. Even if they bring one, I don't think they could beat kayak."
2012,5,Always reliable when it comes to an unreliable way of travel. Flight changes can be stressful but Kayak app keeps me updated within seconds. Buying and changing flights has never been easier.
2012,5,Gets the best rates. Emailing itinerary puts all travel plans into an easy to see/use app. Flight status and tracking. Packing list. Flights. Hotels. Cars. Awesome App!!!
2012,3,"Not bad, but not as good as the ipad app.  Explore feature with ipad is great, please add for android."
2012,4,"It works great! espasialy price comparing, you could save extra few dollars"
2012,5,The best place to find the best deals also has a good UI. I don't see why I would use anything else.
2012,5,Seamless operations....good accuracy....awesome look!!!  Works great on my Samsung Tab 2.
2012,5,I could not think of anyway this app c could be better. works perfect and is extremely accurate
2012,5,"...is an awesome app!  Very useful, handy, and accurate.  Hasn't failed me yet.  Thanks, Kayak!"
2012,5,The currency rate calculater was what sold me amongst an already wide assortment of features and deals. I strongly recommend this app!
2012,3,Good for searching out flights. But I wish they had a package option like priceline and hotwire
2012,5,This is truly a great app. It works much better than the actual website. Great job Kayak.
2012,5,Great tool that provides comprehensive travel application. They have competitive prices also for any trip plan
2012,5,Easy simple and fast. Better than pricelines site could not find buy option on their site.
2012,5,Quite good app giving quick access to great deals. Would recommend it top anybody on the go.
2012,5,Easy tp at least get an idea of what things are gonna cost. Way faster than most sites I've tried.
2012,4,Very easy to use and fast but It would be excellent if the apps transfer the information that I chose when I try to book my flight. Other than this its very Awesome app
2012,4,"Quality software with one issue, ads ;)  And I wish to see a longer tracking period  But over all ...""wipes out"" competion. Great job."
2012,5,I love this app! So easy to use & so many features. Brilliant!
2012,4,Extremely useful. Not sure why it needs so many security permission and run constantly as a service...
2012,5,"Good, dear devolper Requsting to add local travel agents list. (not of home country) and their packages if included wl be EXCELLENT."
2012,5,"I've tried other apps to book flights and hotels, this is by far so much better. Not only do they give you a better selection of choices, but their customer service is Top Notch, they have your back!"
2012,5,We can plan the dates and schedule of our journey through Kayak. Please update the fare properly.
2012,5,The best travelling mgt app I have used so far. Best offers from all websites. Smart and intuitive. If there is one trip app to keep it is that one!
2012,5,"The best search options, great viewing  choices, great web site!"
2012,5,"Clean, simple and smooth. Best travel app out there."
2012,1,App is missing flights.  I get alerts from website and the best priced/travel time flight did not come up when I did exact same search
2012,5,"So useful,Best app ever...loving it without any error :)"
2012,4,Really useful.  Excellent automatic import.  I wish it provided a capability to link to google navigation for turn by turn directions from the airport to the hotel
2012,4,I would of given it 5 but there sure times kayak shows a flight price but when it takes you to the actual site price doubles. Not sure who's error that is
2012,4,No issues so far. Helpful suggestions of nearby airports. Even better that it's free.
2012,4,Site works well. Most information on avail. Choices
2012,5,"1st time user, easy to use. Gives clear details."
2012,5,A very useful application.  I have used it for booking and keeping track of my flights for the first time and I am very impressed so far!!!
2012,4,"It works just fine, would like to have option of both hotel and flights together on one search"
2012,5,"I like the interface and the functionality. It is a joy to use, always accurate and quick."
2012,4,Outstanding. Widget needs work though. SGT10.1
2012,4,I tried looking for hotels in Orlando Florida for Disney world .I could not find any .I get a message with no results . But overall its great with low prices
2012,4,"Very helpful in finding a flight, & it did find the least expensive of all the apps that I tried....but...I still had to call the airline directly to pay for the flight, which cost me an additional 30.00."
2012,4,"It allows you to find any possible mix of alternatives to reconect when you miss a flight, or recognized when theres no other choice but to do other arrangements."
2012,4,"Nice app for flights. Works great for finding flights, haven't book on this app yet."
2012,3,"Wish there was a way to book a flight, hotel, etc.. all together, instead of seperately. Still waiting for a travel app to rival the PC sites available."
2012,4,I like the speed at which I get my answers about flights. I also found I get a better price on the online app as opposed to the website at times...
2012,4,Best one...i would have rated 5star if it also had ALL d international airports details n location...
2012,4,It has been easy to use. Whenever I need to quickly check on flight it is ready.
2012,4,Great app its my number search portal. I'll give it 5 stars when you can set up open jaw alerts.
2012,5,this app works really well.  top work.  thanks
2012,5,Incredible tool!  Keep up  the great work.  ADIOS ORBITZ!
2012,5,"Not only does it offer accurate and up to dare flight info, it also finds cheapest flights for your chosen destination. Really handy for frequent travellers"
2012,4,This was so easy. Shaved 2 hours off my planning and still saved me $
2012,5,Absolutely love it. It works wonders.
2012,5,Easy to use! It's perfect for what I want. It is so simple a 7-year old child could use it. Good job Kayak!
2012,5,Everything you want to have in one place while travelling. Nice desktop widget
2012,4,"App. Is very easy to use and is fun to plan a trip, even if your not going anytime soon...lol"
2012,1,If you have AAA best to just contact hotel directly otherwise you will end up paying more bc they do not honor AAA discounts
2012,5,This app is the best! I get every cheap flight and VERY cheap hotels and good quality. Its very easy and its also exchanges currency stuff. I LOVE THIS APP!
2012,5,"Am amaze at the speed with which flights fees are generated! Even at the comfort of my home, I can make my booking and get prevailing exchange rate."
2012,4,Very fast and easy. Just took a bit of time to find and change the currency. But a nice and simple app otherwise.
2012,5,I love this app because it is so fast and simple. No fluffy stuff just straight to the point. Which I like while working with travel stuff.
2012,5,Very good application. Thank you very much!!! You can find the best prices!!!
2012,4,"Easy to use. Sometimes i wonder off they data is complete, though."
2012,4,Does everything I want in a travel app. Would like it to give me alternate flight days and pricing in a future upgrade.
2012,5,Works great for searching and booking. Everything I want it to do!!
2012,4,So far so gud. Love the email features and i could pay airport in person.
2012,5,Great interface. Easy to use. Better than most other apps.
2012,5,The my trips functionality is so handy. Wish the airport maps were better.
2012,5,I found some of the best prices that no one else offers. Thank you soo much
2012,4,Does exactly what I wanted. An awesome tool when traveling or just to browse cheap destinations
2012,4,Performance and UI are awesome - doesn't route through  multiple international airports sometimes even though it is possible.
2012,5,Easy to use. Searching hotels via maps is very cool and helps greatly in planning.
2012,5,Better and quicker than their website. A must-have if you travel at all or are weird and just like to look up flight prices.
2012,2,Looks good nice interface however doesn't list all airlines.In fact only list one airline
2012,4,Sometimes I get good deals here. The app is really handy too.
2012,4,Helpful to a frequent traveler. Fast responses on all flight connections available. Filters allow shortlisting according to requirements.
2012,5,"Excellent app. I move around a lot, so Kayak is priceless."
2012,5,"Love this app for quickly comparing flights, times and prices. Just wish that when you book a flight it saves your search criteria into the airlines website so you don't have to find the flights all over again on the airline website when I just did on Kayak."
2012,4,"Very useful, and easy to use, downloaded this app to help plan our vacation to whitewater in Atlanta 4 days before our trip love it!"
2012,5,Works pretty good on my htc Android
2012,5,Has the best prices in comparison to going straight 2 the airlines sites. Best planning site. T-Mobile MyTouch_4G_Slide.
2012,4,Very usefull app : fast & easy to view all flights : Can know best least fares and issue the tickets  Thank you
2012,4,perfect. easy to use. but needs more cheap flights 2 choose from
2012,4,Easy & simple...very helpful.i iv 4 coz it wud be better if it could give us change the currency instead of only use us dollar..
2012,2,"Deals aren't that good. Certainly NOT the Beat deals. Best deals, for hotels at least is hotels app."
2012,5,So convenient to use. Great UI. Very good prices too
2012,4,Best online app out there. Love the trip feature.
2012,5,Used kayak for years. Works fine now in the nexus 7.
2012,3,How do I know these are best price?
2012,5,Simply superb app. Thanks a ton for making life simple :-)
2012,4,A bit oldish interface but it works perfectly for what it is supposed to do.

2012,4,I've used this app to book a hotel from a subway train and to quote out airplane tickets. I really like Kayak. I just got the updated tablet version and the only thing I find wrong is some pages won't load into landscape orientation. They should probably make that happen.
2012,3,Not perfect as it's missing quite a few places though you can finetune your search by opting for various national Kayak portals. During my test searches (across Germany and Malta) I missed user reviews which might have been handy. Text formatting leaves a lot to be desired (e.g. proper paragraphs and listings) as reading descriptions is cumbersome. Pricing is ok but check portals and currencies for money saving arbitrage opportunities.
2012,4,"To do a detailed search I may prefer to work on the full Kayak, but to set alerts, reserve a hotel from the road, or check flight prices from bed, the app is reliable and never crashes, which is saying something for my phone.  HTC Incredible."
2012,1,It used to be a great app till few weeks ago when they decided to take off My Trips feature. This was the most convenient feature of the Kayak app. Hope they put it back soon.
2012,4,"Needs to have the ability to change the currency that you want, not just USD! And if you don't have a photo available (not sure why, when I easily found some photos available for 5 of the ones that you were saying had none) remove the generic picture as its a little misleading!"
2012,4,If you travel and want to bet the best price at your disposal then this is a must app. I then quality is just awesome.... A big thanks to the developers
2012,4,"Since i got to know of this site i've never bothered to check another. For flights, car rentels & hotels i find this the quickest & most reliable website. Though i wish it had more coverage on cruises as well... But for the others it's a one-hit-site!"
2012,5,"Has great features, everything you need to effectively plan a trip. Has major airport info including maps of terminals, airline contact info, baggage fees, etc. Really nice app. Droid Bionic"
2012,5,"I love this app! I love how the hotel results, shows you not only all hotels and their pricing, but the star rating, photos and reviews! Nothing better than a one stop shop."
2012,4,Been planning a trip to Paris and this app makes it easy to search flights. Only complaint is the app doesn't seem to be as up to date as website. I get two different amounts when comparing app and site. Other than that its great.
2012,4,"Unfortunately the UI is very heavy looking, non elegant as could be using Android possibilities.  Instead, it follows iPhone's very ugly and noncreative UI rules. Pity."
2012,4,"I got exactly what I booked. No meed to stay on the phone or talk to sales reps... I just booked my hotel room, got there and checked in... no surprises. And most of all no hassle.. that's always a plus!"
2012,5,"I have enjoyed Kayak since it launched, and the Android apparently doesn't disappoint me.  Cool feature of holding your itineraries even if you didn't use the site!  Bravo."
2012,5,I've been a fan for years of Kayak.  Using it on my Blackberry was good but I'm even more impressed by it on my Samsung Galaxy 2!
2012,1,Terrible! Could only find hotels in Boston starting around $220 per night. Googled hotels in Boston found one for $100 per night. Uninstall and never will use kayak again.
2012,4,I frequent Kayak to search for flights & other deals. I love that I can usually find the best competitive prices; having access to it on my phone now makes it even more convenient.
2012,4,"Kayak allows for the fully estimated airline fare price with taxes included.  I appreciate being able to search flights based on airlines, non-stop status, & time estimation."
2012,2,"I can't believe the tablet version doesn't have ""My Trips"". Works great on phone. Fix the tablet and get 5 stars."
2012,5,"Simple, Convenient, and most important (especially with traveling) app is ACCURATE!! needed info on flights and not only was the information accurate to the amount of seats left but got me the BEST RATE!! A flight I was going to pay $150 on other sites came to $85 with Kayak app.. transition to pay was painless also. Simple to filter and browse. If your traveling.. GET KAYAK APP ASAP!!"
2012,4,This app makes it so convenient to book my flights and its great that it save my search history for later. I also like the price change notifications.
2012,4,"But there isn't the flex month option like on the website. I suggest you also include a ""search cheapest destinations"" for people who want to travel but don't have a specific destination in mind"
2012,5,"I don't usually travel much but that all changed this year. I booked one trip using Kayak, the others were set by family & business associates.  How convenient to email confirmations for three different airlines to Kayak for easy access through this app. I also enjoy access to previous trips when questions arise regarding travel dates and frequent flyer miles questions.  Fantastic app!"
2012,4,"Great app for on the go flight checks. Allows for quick and easy flight availability and price. Saves your most recent search which is great, especially when you are avidly checking a prices or flight times for a specific trip."
2012,5,"App...allows you to search prices for multiple dates to find the cheapest month to travel for planning a vacation. In addition, I was able to determine through this app. that the price of flights do not dramatically decrease if you are looking for a flight tomorrow as airlines are offering better last minute prices to fill that last seat. Truth is, it appears that prices are cheaper the further out you plan and you also have more seats to choose from."
2012,5,First time user...really easy and fast! So many flights to choose from and I loved the ability to filter! Will absolutely use again.
2012,5,Nice interface and super easy to use.  Even for old people like me with fat fingers and bad eyes.  Wish the rating tool was as easy.
2012,5,"Makes searching for flights quick and painless. Haven't tried to buy through the app though. Also, tracking flights is very helpful when running to your terminal"
2012,5,"Best app evvvveeerrrrrrrrrr very user friendly, very very fast, very helpfull, very full of all the options u need. Reliable. I LOVE IT"
2012,5,So happy I found this app! Easy to use & love the price alert feature. Definitely recommend to everyone!
2012,5,"Flawless, this interface is easy to use. Best design all around very erganomic. Everything is right where u need it"
2012,5,"I have used a couple other sites and a couple travel agents, but I always seem to get more for my money here. The features are similar to the normal website, makes it easy to use."
2012,5,"It has all the necessary functions, yet very simple to use. It works great and fast enough. Simple and clean app design is great too."
2012,4,It never fails me and shows great prices. My only complain is the widget is only for tablets :(
2012,5,"Great app. Needs to update flights when I change flights instead of adding to it, otherwise great. Also like to see where I am sitting in the plane."
2012,4,"Easy to use, sometimes doesn't refresh but second try works, not a big deal. Really convenient and great interface."
2012,5,Easy to use.  Well thought out.  Incorporating my flight info into my Kayac trip itinerary from another site was as easy as emailing the confirmation to Kayac.  It was added within minutes.  Awesome!
2012,4,I D/L the app while waiting to clock in to work and I have a flight setup for my vacation. So simple to use.
2012,3,"Awesome travel app, does tons of useful stuff.  Problem is it crashes every time I try to view my hotel reservation, sometimes so hard that I need to do a hard reset."
2012,5,works great  never a problem and I find the best prices I can. I can't ask for more
2012,1,"This App got worst with Bing Maps, It freezes a lot. I'm using HTC EVO 3D"
2012,3,Good AP to inquire about travel details. But for last minute trips I've found better deals on other sites.
2012,3,Good but missing some option you have on Web site. Makes more difficult to book flights.
2012,4,Great app. Works great for searching for travel plans. Get rid of the ads and it'd be 5 stars.
2012,4,Never travel without kayak however smartphone freezing usually forces me to actually book from computer. This app is great for checking and comparing even of I have to book online.
2012,3,Good search app. Found me a great deal on hotels. Updated pretty regular. Worth a try.
2012,5,"I'm very impressed with the functionality and user friendly tools this app has to offer, works great when shopping around for multiple airline options."
2012,5,I never had no problem in booking hotels or flys. I love this application... Thank you guys!!!
2012,5,"Love it. Not only easy to find great deals, but real-time flight status updates"
2012,5,"I used Kayak on my smart android phone and was amazed by its super fast speed, easy surfing and wonderful features at one touch."
2012,3,I found a really cheap rate problem is I went on the computers website and found an even cheaper one. Ugh...gould thing I didn't buy it yet
2012,4,Good for quickly comparing flights but doesn't give all features of website and can't sign into your profile
2012,5,I love it! Its my perfict mate for a short trip. Making my bookings know takes me 15 min.
2012,5,Best hotel app ever. Clean no bugs. Oh and such good deals
2012,5,Absolutely love it. Fast and user friendly. Not too complicated excellent!
2012,5,"Well designed, a pleasure to use! Just needs to build up more users, reviews etc."
2012,5,This app is awesome. It gives you price alerts and it user friendly. Great job kayak
2012,5,One of the best travel apps on Android market.  Absolutely love it!
2012,4,"Good interface, but it leaves out many options compared to the internet version."
2012,5,Flawless operation. Wish it had the option to search for cruises but overall its a good app.
2012,1,"You can assume I'm in an unfamiliar city when booking a room, so this program's lack of a link to my free phone/tablet navigation software is a fatal flaw."
2012,1,Every time I attempt to view my upcoming itinerary I get a 'Force Close' message & Kayak shuts down - hopefully I'll be able to resolve this before my trip.
2012,5,I don't travel as much so used to since retiring. Wish this was around give years ago. It does it all!
2012,1,Always fails requests. I've had the app for a few days now and have yet to get a price request to go through at all.
2012,5,Brilliant app for checking out cheap flights. Only problem being the multi city tab doesn't always find the same price as looking at the individual flights as one ways
2012,4,Best so far! Searchin is easy rates a even better... Jus all around great
2012,5,I used Kayak on blackberry and the Android app is waaaaaay better. I use it for hotel booking.
2012,4,Saves my time!Searching for flights from a single view it is really helpful.Really fast and helps me find the best offers.
2012,4,I love this app I don't know how many time we are on the or just planning a spur of the moment trip and this app gives a quick list of hotels to choose from.
2012,5,"Great flow, easy to use. Great adaptation of the full website. Kudos to the programmers. Wish more websites were like this."
2012,4,"I have found it to be both reliable, and convenient as a tool for a traveller ti have handy in his phone."
2012,4,Great search and sort functions. Works fast on Galaxy SII.
2012,4,"It helps me find some cheap tickets, but I payed for a ticket through the app and it never went through. Great prices, but tough for purchases."
2012,5,This is a time saver if you travel alot. I recommend it!
2012,5,Use often to compare flight prices. Helpful when on the go. Unfortunately it keeps freezing but is worth it anyway.
2012,5,Great apply. Best prices. Love it.
2012,5,Full featured app. The only  thing I found I can't do is cruise searches.
2012,4,"Great app, you can check so many options all from your phone"

2012,5,Grear app
2012,5,:)
2012,4,"This app has amazed me with it's design, usability & speed. I also love the way it creates itinerary from simple emails in a very neat format.  Only disadvantage I see is that it does not include budget airlines like Ryan air in it's search. Add them all."
2012,4,"Does what it needs to, quickly. I'd like an option for separate flight, hotel and car widgets, so I could switch between them without having to re-enter searches. Integrated coupon/discount code/rebate search would be good, too."
2012,5,this app to great! It gives you all of the information that you need to plan your trip. I use it to plan trips from san diego to phoenix all the time & it always give me the best pricing for everything. To sum things up in 1 word: Awesome!! Thanks kayak
2012,4,Great to have all flight information at my fingertips. I just need to figure out how these phone alerts are supposed to work. Has iPhone option on the site but wonder if applies for all phones including Android
2012,5,Great app! Saved me so much time finding a hotel for unexpected guests. I was also able to help my friends find a great deal on a rental car while  theirs was being repaired. What could have been a disaster turned into a triumph!!
2012,5,Live in Hawaii so I fly home to Michigan about twice a year. I have to check constantly for ticket prices so I can get a good deal cause flying from here is not cheap. This app has been a life saver!!!! Lets me check and compare prices for plane tickets and car rentals super fast and super easy!!! I would recommend this to any one who travels alot or even a little.
2012,5,Gave me hope of being able to afford our summer vacation. Have me options and dates and great prices.i'm so happy.thanks kyak and its Mt first time doing the trip planning Mt boyfriend usually does it. yeah me......
2012,4,Not all features show up as on the site. Such as my rental car deal through hotwire. But that comes with not having the in page advertisements that the website has. Very handy though for keeping track of my tickets to my sisters wedding
2012,1,"Let's me enter everything needed to reserve a hotel, yet won't allow you to complete the transaction. Thanks kayak. Deleted"
2012,4,Haven't booked yet. But UI is excellent. Will give 5 stars if booking process runs a smoothly as the app. Galaxy Nexus (CDMA)
2012,2,this is a commercial app and the company already making tons of money from it. but still put up ads half size of the screen and flashing all time. very annoying. remove immediately. Don't recommand it.
2012,2,"You can't search for flexible dates more than 2 days. You won't find the cheapest deals as others. Good only for kayak fans, but for me I'm uninstalling"
2012,4,Excellent to track all your travel instead of looking it up in emails. Would be better if have same features as desktop app. Can't edit trip name and can't delete canceled.
2012,2,The new update has no extra features the phone version has. I had a packing list that i had worked on then the update happened and it was gone. Same with many other features. Not available in new app.
2012,4,"the app itself is helpful with good features. the widget is HORRENDOUS and won't hold fares i want to monitor. the dates stay, but no pricing."
2012,5,"This app is amazing in its depth, especially for a free one. Tons of features and everything is fast and well designed. If only all apps were like this..."
2012,4,Nearly perfect. Maybe need few adjustment. Wish had few option to make the font/boxes smaller. So i can view more flight in one page
2012,5,"This app puts all your travel info at an easy to find locale. Gives you updates on baggage pickup quickly, a plus in large airports. Great app."
2012,4,The best application ever for booking flight tickets.   I hope that in the future other currencies will be added so that we don't have to go back to see the price in local currencies (in my case Omani Rials. This wil help us a lot save time and effort.
2012,4,"I have been trying to find an international flight. I have changed dates and airports etc. Typically I get similar results. However, I occasionally get a slightly cheaper flight. Then I immediately input those exact dates and ended up getting a higher quote. What's that about?"
2012,5,"Information at your fingertips! Well organized, with lots of filtering options to be as selective as you want. This app should be everyone's first stop when traveling, from the seasoned traveler to the occasional vacationer."
2012,5,Kayak is the best flight search app i have ever used. You can find the best available deal within a minute. I love this app.  Rishi from Nepal (now london)
2012,4,"Great app. Easy to use. Would have given five stars if the notification function actually worked outside the app, like beeping even when the app is not open."
2014,4,"Great app most of the time, but latest version 6.2.1 lost great functionality of search history on flights. Now you must manually re-enter data each time you check a flight/route."
2012,1,"Example. Kayak quote 1200 for a flight you can buy direct from airline for 800. Total rip off. They also quote 150 for hotel I am currently in and I paid 50. Nice app, but shocking prices."
2012,5,"Kayak is definitely helpful. My husband is in the Army so were budgeted and sometimes need last minute flights, & i've never had a problem with no flights or to expensive. Love it!! Thanks Kayak!"
2012,4,"Flipping pictures of hotels is awkward - skips past images, bing maps are very slow to load (using wifi or 4g), otherwise nice app."
2012,5,"I've found this app to be very helpful when I don't have time to do a lot of browsing. There are times that I want to relax and take a nice long look at my vacation opportunities. Most of the time when traveling, I don't have the time. That's when this app is really helpful. It shows me the info needed to make a quick decision that I can feel confident with.  Always use the info they provide to ensure you'll be staying someplace that will make your trip an enjoyable one. I've only booked hotels w/ this app."
2012,5,This is the only and best trip app I use. Has amazing deals and awesome features. Found cheap fights instantly and never freezes up
2012,5,"Like using this app on Xoom over other travel apps. Really quick and easy.  In fact, I will use this instead of hitting the website via pc browser!"
2012,4,The way you select dates is a little tricky but newest version is a whole lot better than previous one. Good job guys!
2012,2,"I'm leaving on a trip tomorrow, and ""My Trips"" is gone from the tablet version! I didn't expect the update to take away the most important function! Please! Back to five stars when you fix it."
2012,2,Tell me again why a price booking service needs access to all my petsonal info??? Had it for a while but its ever reaching creep for more unneccessary personal forces me to uninstall .
2012,5,"Gives me all I'm used to from my desktop and some neat tools that I can't wait to try out when I travel. Also, I am loving the My Trips feature."
2012,1,"permissions, permissions.  Great app. But, I'm not updating. It demand too much of my information in return."
2012,5,"The progress bar gets to 99% then stops. It never returns results. Wtf? And this is after several ""updates."" Good job, kayak."
2012,3,"The app is great! But, I am 12 days from going OS and could really use the my trip section of the app on my tablet. Otherwise, it is almost faultless."
2012,5,"This app, is the best I have found for planning, every aspect of your trip. Do not have to look anywhere else. Thank you KAYAK."
2012,3,Pretty good app. Can't get the automatic price alert to work though. When I manually search I come up with cheaper fares....
2012,5,Always works perfectly. Reliable for tracking flights from any airline. Also nice price checking has a lot of different airlines on a sleek interface.
2012,4,"The best when it comes to comparing flights and hotels in one touch. App is easy to use if you need quick info. Website more efficient but if on the go, this is a must!"
2012,4,Extremely helpful in terms of planning and purchasing. Only bad thing is you have to go through the browser to purchase.
2012,1,I am a frequent flyer and depended on Kayak. Without My Trips it is just like other services. Please bring it back soon.... 5 stars when you do.....
2012,3,New widget more useful but shouldn't need whole page. Like the new flight tracker appearance.
2012,5,"This is the best travel app out there! User friendly, day, accurate....and the best flight tracker around. An absolute must for all travelers!"
2012,5,"ui is user friendly.  good design, highly recommended.  after three months of use, the best of them all."
2012,5,"It helped me find my flight fast. Since price ranges go up and down unexpectedly, I was able to continously check the price in order to find a good deal!"
2012,4,"Great app!! Haven't full used it, I wish it allowed you the ability to pick which seat you preferred. Please update!"
2012,5,Works well on EVO 4G. Use it to plan all our trips.  It is our first choice to get the best trip info.
2012,4,Only improvment needed-- could not book flight from the app... had to email info to myself and book thar way. Minor issue.
2012,1,Version 5.1 in my tablet lost MyTrips view! Phone version does. Will get 5 stars when fixed.
2012,5,Booked a whole vacation off my phone and had no problems and also saved a lot. Definitely using this again!
2012,2,"I am currently attempting to book a trip to Europe this summer. Whenever I use the app, it highlights six reasonably priced flights, but as soon as i click the book now button, the price skyrockets at least 300 dollars..."
2012,5,This app is great. It is extremely user friendly and really does find the cheapest flights that fits your timeline. Very satisfied.
2012,4,Great app. Would 5 star it if a tablet specific version came out.
2012,4,Fantastic app to bundle all your bookings! The only thing I would love on top is that it would raise alerts by Notifications.
2012,5,Just as good as their Web site. Awesome deals across many airlines. Cannot go wrong with this app.
2012,4,"Easy to use, only draw back is some preferential treatment for certain airlines. Multiple carriers have the same price, but all of US Airway's show, making it difficult to find Delta and United only happens when they are the same price though"
2012,4,Very efficient with the results. Allows me to decide quickly my best option. If southwest was in the option it would be 5 stars
2012,5,The Kayak app plays well with all my travel data -correctly integrating the emails I forward from my company travel department and personal travel sites. It also automatically notifies my significant other on my flight details - saving me a lot of headache! Love it!
2012,3,Now I rate it 3 stars. When pressing back button it will stay on the same screen. Sometimes app with freeze. ICS. HTC one s
2012,5,"Love Kayak, but the Android app could use a little tweaking. Otherwise top-notch. HTC Evo 4G."
2012,5,Works well to search. Haven't actually purchased anything yet. Will probably soon though
2012,5,"Love this app. All I do is PRT I. My destinations, dates, and price and it alerts me to buy my ticket. It doesn't get any better than this.  Everyone is happy, XOXO Cami"
2012,5,Very nice interface. Love the tablet optimized version. Very helpful in finding the best deals in a city. More intuitive to use than the full web site.
2012,5,"Thanks to Kayak I don't have to talk to people anymore, I can just use this app to find all the cheapest rates to my next Star Trek convention!"
2012,2,Need for sharing options can only share by email. need to be able to share by text messaging. HTC Inspire
2012,5,Has worked well so far. No crashes. Found hotels and flights easily. I recommend this app
2012,5,"Provides many options for flights, hotels,  holidays, and many more other options. And excellent tool for travel related costings and purchases."
2012,4,Easy to use. Lots of options. Interface isn't always so smooth or pretty. But it does the job.
2012,5,Have been using kayak since the opened the website. One of the first flight searches to use Ajax. Great Android app too.
2012,4,Almost as good as the website. The filters are almost as good as the website.  It is much easier to get to though.  Works fine on Xoom.
2012,5,"I've always been a fan of Kayak but just recently got the app a few months ago and I love it!! Ive booked 2 flights, a car rental and a few hotels and its been so easy! Highly recommend it for frequent travelers!"
2012,5,A really good easy to use and fast way to find flights. I haven't used all the other features but I am sure they work as good.
2012,4,"It works good, just wish the reviews was updated to 2012. If that happened I'd give it 5 stars."
2012,5,"I love this app! Clean interface, quick and up to date results which help me to complete my trip plans!"
2012,4,Love the app.  Wish you could book car-hotel-flight as a package.
2012,5,My last trips I've purchased my flight tickets and other deals through the app. Easy and cheap!
2012,5,Needs to be easier to make actual reservation by phone.  Seem to get foreign call center.
2012,2,Nice to be able to search all hotels in the area without using individual chains apps.  but constant force closing gets annoying!!!
2012,5,"Works wonderfully.  Just hope they include ""search nearby airports"" option"
2012,4,It was the easiest and least expensive of all the flying options... Great app
2012,5,Love Kayak! We use this app everytime we book a flight and the rates are lower than any other competing travel search online.
2012,1,"Awful and laggy interface makes this app terrible and honestly unusable because of it. Kayak is a good website and service, but the app is awful."
2012,5,Some names of plight are missing.... Add more days option for pligth tracking...... However its the best apps i hv used....
2012,5,Very user friendly and comprehensive. Planned a whole vacation in minutes...literally! Awesome app  :-)
2012,5,This app compiles all of the popular travel sites in one easy to use..and attractive interface.  It's definetely a 5 star app.
2012,4,"Easy to use interface, very fast, couldn't ask for more really."
2012,5,Everything you need at your fingertips. Quick uploads. Multiple options. Download now!
2012,4,"Very good, I have found some cheap fares buy using it then I go to the airlines website and buy the tickets. Even found airports I didn't know of"
2012,5,I manage a US Cellular store and I am always looking for new apps to show my customers and associates. This one always comes up in my conversations and is still my favorite app....
2012,3,"They have pretty good prices, but they are extremely partial to certain lines. I'm guessing 1 of those airlines own this app or pay them?"
2012,5,Have this on my droid phone and my ipad. I find hotels on the fly and this is fantastic.
2012,4,Needs to be more flexible on dates of flight reservations. one day plus or minus won't hurt especially if you are going on tourism.
2012,5,Great detailed interface. Easy to use with so many options.
2012,5,"Works great, no bugs and. runs pretty fast. Love this app!"
2012,5,"Works great.  Good for finding quick airfares,  easy to get around, change itinerary,etc."
2012,5,"The choice and options are similar to the website, minus the flex month and price matrix. Everything you really need is at your fingertips."
2012,5,"I travel more then Keith Urban, importing, 10 flights from syd to lax, tampa to denver, hotels in Nashville you name it all year. I wish it doesn't force close... then if you offered ""didn't see it quickly"" i'd buy it."
2012,5,Great interface. Low prices. In general a very helpful app and fun to use.
2012,5,Everything you need to get the best travel deal!! Booking a package isn't always the cheapest :)
2012,4,No provision for accompanied minors or infants in lap limits usefulness for non-business travel. Still a great app for business travel!
2012,5,love love love it! fast and awesome.. got my maui-Seoul-Tokyo-Osaka-maui deal at $800s. cool!
2012,4,"Would just like to see a feature similar to ""Explore"" which is available on the website."
2012,5,Thanks for the Android tablet version! It's now one of my favorites apps.
2012,5,Love Kayak and this app works wonderfully. Can quickly set up alerts on flights for a getaway or frequent trips.
2012,5,Easy to use interface. Fast results. Great search engine.
2012,5,Recent updates have made this app way more usable. Keep up the good work.
2012,4,Works very good on my phone and Android Tablet.  I like that it searches all travel sites.
2012,2,This program is huge. Takes up more space then the gigantic app of facebook.
2012,2,"Got the oops request failed message twenty times, it found flights once successfully. I guess it doesn't work very well"
2012,5,Been using this for quite a while.  Works great with lots of easy to use features.
2012,5,Love the app. Easy to navigate and provides tons of useful info when planning your travels. It's actually fun!
2012,3,Compared to the main site this app seems to give far less info and comparison prices.  Id much rather wait to get in laptop then depend on info given on here
2012,5,This app works very well and fast.  We use Kayak a lot and this app makes it just as easy as my PC.
2012,5,Nice tool to help find prices for just about everything. Flight Tracker is nice except it does not auto update.
2012,5,Easy to navigate and search. Does what it's supposed to do
2012,4,"Kayak loads quickly, offers the results I need and does it all seamlessly.  Excellent app! Highly recommended."
2012,4,"Rubbish. Major bug with location entry prevents searching for flights, so it's useless. Don't like the text-free main menu either."
2012,5,Rated A for Awesome. Really gave me the best prices out of the other booking places. Give it a try. Maybe you'll save up too.
2012,5,It's quite good now on my HTC Sensation w/ CM9.  Thanks for the updates.
2012,2,Great functionality but poor UI design. Have a look at the Android design Site to make it look more android - ish
2012,5,All you need in a free travel app. Tons of extra features. Only one you need
2012,5,I'm a travel agent and l oolite to check flights when out of the office. Great search features.
2012,5,"love the ease of use, search features and when i'm ready to book it takes me to the site directly. what else can i ask for?!?!?!?!"
2012,4,I love the Flight Tracker feature.  Great for when I'm picking someone up at the airport.
2012,5,"For us airline ppl you can put in a city code and it ""KNOWS"" what you mean....I love it.... All of your necessary information is a swipe away after your initial request has been entered ... KAYAK...GOOD WORK"
2012,5,Sweet app for finding cheap flights. Cant believe how user friendly it is and I develop websites. Great job!!!!
2012,4,The only draw back is that there is no option for chaild and infant choise in booking. Only adult!
2012,4,Loved this app! Great tool for on the go travelers to get quick info.
2012,4,Can I search packages? I.e. flight and hotel? I didn't see that option in the app.
2012,3,My only problem is they don't seem to list southwest flights :( But it's a pretty good App.
2012,5,Quick and more features then expected.  No unexpected shutdowns a d easy to navigate.
2012,5,Looks like this is the perfect answer to the type of traveling we do.  We never know where our driving could take us and this tells us what hotels are in the next upcoming city.
2012,5,Love using this app for finding flights. User friendly!!
2012,4,Only obe glitch in calendar search. Plus the size is a little large.
2012,5,"I've used it several times to check flights to visit my fiancée and it has been flawless. No crashing, easy to use, and fast!"
2012,5,Only used it once for trip to new orleans. And it found used a great hotel closed to burbon st. Last minute during mardigras really cheap!
2012,5,Works pretty well. Just booked trip to Vegas!
2012,4,It's simple design and intuitive interface makes for a great app
2012,3,Iphone version has 'pro' version with no ad banners..just $2. So why android has ads?
2012,5,"Works very well!  Easy, fast and useful! Recommended."
2012,4,"So easy to use. Kayak usually finds the cheapest flights, and quickly too."
2012,5,"I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to input and modify searches, and at how quickly results came back."
2012,5,"Use this all the time. Does not show flights for Southwestern, but other than that it has been great!"
2012,5,"I'm a 1k traveler and I swear by this app.. fantastic alerts, easy to use, great for keeping all my itineraries in order."
2012,5,Fantastic! Mytrips is a really good tool to organize your trips and have info about your flights and hotels in your phone
2012,5,"Use this for all my traveling needs that I have to do in the military. I can find the perfect flight home for leave with the quickest, seamless, and cheapest route."
2012,5,"I use this app to search for flights and hotel prices. It does everything I need it to and it does it well. Overall, it's excellent!"
2012,5,"Best app ever, this is how I get all my travel needs taken care of...its a life saver, otherwise you would pay more for flights without even comparing...so recommended..."
2012,4,I will always use Kayak to.book travel from now on... Definitely the best deals!
2012,5,Feature rich. I like the price alerts.
2012,5,"I USE IT FIRST AND LAST UPON TRAVELLING . PRICES , AVAILABILITY, FOR FLIGHTS FROM COACH TO FIRST CLASS . THANKS FOR THIS APP IT ROCKS .DON CISCO THE JET SET VATO"
2012,4,It just works.. Good job
2012,1,Keeps saying failure! Won't load flights! Removing ASAP!
2012,5,This is pretty accurate to what the other web sites are posting. I use it frequently to check and book flights
2012,1,"Useless in Australia.  Certain flight - qantas $303, kayak $461.  Uninstalled"
2012,5,I love this app it's pretty accurate. Even when I tested it while my wife going to the computer looking up flights that we were booking

2012,5,Rocks
2012,5,Yeah
2012,1,"I usually stay logged into kayak through my facebook account. I just bought plane tickets through kayak mobile and wanted to add my itinerary into the my trips option. It didn't show all of my trip dates so I thought I would log out and then log back into the account. Ha! I logged out and it wouldn't let me log back in, constantly showing me an error. I sent kayak a feedback complaint and haven't heard back from them. I had really great experiences with kayak before so I ended up caving and making an accoun"
2012,4,"I like how easy it is to enter info and find what you need.  Keeps your last search so you can check prices later. Tracks prices and sends you updates on more than one flight at a time to compare.  Nice app.  Very thorough packing lists too!  Had to laugh when one of the items was ""husband"".  ;)"
2012,4,"It's everything in one place for all your travel needs, can't ask for more. The menus are simple and the information is thorough.  -1 star because for the hell of me I can't get it to log in using Facebook on my A500 with ICS. Not sure if this is a bug or something I'm doing wrong. I'm logged into facebook using the facebook app, the native ICS browser AND the default browser on the tablet which is Chrome beta."
2012,1,Every fight I tried to book the price had suddenly gone up but it always show the same low price on the main page. How come? Just to SAY they have good deals? I asked for a certain date and it keeper showing me the previous day at midnight...wouldn't that be the next day? Loaded ORBITZ...right price and right date. Uninstalled.
2012,1,"Searched for hotels in Ocean City, Md.  & every listing had no price but said call. I could do that with the yellow pages. No prices EQUAL WORTHLESS in my estimation. Will stick with the apps that actually quote prices, thanks."
2012,5,I'm a big fan of Kayak. The Android App does a great job in bringing to a small screen the great service we are used on the web. Lots of filters to find the best flight and you always get the best deals. Load it on your phone and start saving as you travel! Recommended by Best Apps Market.
2012,5,"Super convenient, if somewhat slower (obvs) than running the full-blown website on a modern laptop w/ broadband connection--but that comes with the territory with mobile apps. So easy to use, and it once allowed me to single-handedly counterthwart Hurricane Irene. Seriously."
2012,2,Lots of black screens on gnexus. Works mostly though. Worst thing is the UI it is straight iOS rip and looks horrible. Please make a true android UI. It is not hard.
2012,4,"I have been using this app for a couple of months and find it very useful, I am a frequent business traveller on trains and. planes. It recently helped the staff at US airways to determine the length of my delay. I have had one glitch on my current trips but am sorting it out. Do not let this put you off but I need to be honest to give a full review"
2012,4,This is quite awesome! Although I do believe they marked up the price Slightly.  ********** The widget is 5x5 when my screen is only 4x5 so I cant have the widget on my home screen :(  Can we have smaller widget like 4x2 ?
2012,5,Lots of great features to make your travel plans very easy. Looking forward to a tablet specific experience some time in the future (specifically map view + hotel list in one screen). Thanks for the great work!
2012,4,This app is better than using the actual Internet for searching flights. Kayak takes that one step further by aggregating all the sites. Love the price alert/notifications too. Well done.
2012,5,"Best application I have.  Used it on my android phone for about 6 months.  Just put on new tablet.  I love it.  Only suggestion,  have flight tracker work automatically off of the booked flights.  Is a real time saver when traveling a lot."
2012,4,"Widget comes 5x5 and it won't let me add it to my home screen. Please lower the size so I can resize it. By the way, great app. Galaxy Nexus"
2012,5,"I'm constantly looking up flights and rental cars on Kayak, and it's really easy with this app. I never book on my phone, but it's a handy tool, especially when trying to coordinate multi-stop vacations in between meetings."
2012,4,"I use Kayak sporadically, and only disappoints when I ask for something exotic.  Searches do not include all airlines like Southwest, which is usually the cheapest for domestic economy routes.  Overall a great app to have for the business or casual traveler."
2012,4,"Love it! Very convenient! However, today I had to book a flight 1 Adult and 2 Child. There is no option for Child and Senior."
2012,3,"I would give it a higher score if it was less intrusive. Why do they need to know who I call (luckily for me, not possible on my tablet, otherwise I wouldn't install it in the first place)"
2012,3,"App is feature rich, but price alerts and  notifications don't work. The app's feedback tool hangs."
2012,5,"Let's you synchronize your travel plans between the website and Android device. Useful tools like currency converter, Flight Tracker, Packing List. Would be great if airport terminal maps were also included."
2012,4,I like the app a lot. Only real disappointment is when almost all hotels listed say call for pricing. That's not helpful at all. Would suggest that first 10 hotels listed have to show price then you could list all the ones that say call for pricing.
2012,5,"I enjoyed searching for hotels,flights and car rentals with KAYAK. Very user friendly and easy to understand. Keep up with the great work…^_^"
2012,5,"This app, imo, is a better user experience than kayaks website. The flight and hotel search workflow is flawless. The filtering,  sorting and mapping of results is very well done."
2012,5,I thought price alerts on flights was awesome enough ... but now you can track a flight status! How awesome is that?! All the convenience of a computer on a smart phone :)
2012,4,Really this app succeeds by not having any annoying and/or confusing features. I was able to dive right in. I like kayak on a full computer and this is just as good.
2012,5,Does a really good job of finding flights and hotels. I'm in the military and often need to look for a cheap flight. The UI is great and it is pretty intuitive. I like it better than some of the other travel apps that are available.
2012,4,"Easy to use app, works without a flaw. Only wish is that there was a way to save searches and edit them quickly."
2012,2,Tix were 200. Chose new date and Tix were more.. Went to back up to the original message date but price was high and half the flights were the gone... Sucks
2012,5,I have been using Kayak for more than a year.. I was using through PC. Now i use Kayak from my Android and it is MORE easy and i never be disappoint by its service. KAYAK is GREAT and giving us an excelent service
2012,1,Useless if your not on wifi. Any searches on 3g even on full bars fails and the app complains weak signal..... couldn't look up one flight on 3g were I was getting a 3mbps connection....
2012,4,"Very good but cant put more than one airport in the search fields. Also, it'd be nice to share results via whatsapp, sms, etc"
2012,5,"Quick, lots of results, easy to use. Def recommend to anybody wanting to know travel prices at any given moment."
2012,5,Str8 fwd does what u want. I removed 3 other apps from my phone because this one does it all. (and more).
2012,4,Kayak's user interface seems far superior to other travel apps that I have found.  Being able to quickly filter searches and switch to map view is extremely helpful and functional.
2012,5,"Easy yo use, Accurate and just great. My last few trips have been booked through kayak and works great."
2012,4,"Would rate it a 5, but when you set to get daily alerts, it doesn't.. I missed several of cheap flights depending on the price change alert..other then that.. great!"
2012,4,I love this app. I have visited other sites and kayak offers great deals for the same flights that other websites offer but at better lower prices. Thanks kayak
2012,5,"It truely does find the best deals, and with a budget like mine, I really needed this. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a children option. Other than that, really great!!"
2012,4,"Great app, excellent for checking hotels, flights and car rentals on the go. The only thing that bothered me was when I had unlimited results selected it would always force close. Running on SE arc"
2012,5,"Fast to research travel options! I especially enjoy the filter function! This is a ""keeper!"" (HTC Rezound)"
2012,4,Kayak is not what it used to be. Not as many deals around on this website anymore. I keep finding better deals on other sites
2012,4,Does trip pricing and planning well.  Only thing I would like to see is ability to display flights by direction rather than complete round trips.  Expedia does this.
2012,3,Good but better if it covered all lowcosts airlines & find cheapest flights even it means buying two separate tickets on different airlines (skyscanner  does this). Shame it doesn't search for European train tickets..
2012,3,"User friendly and includes many features, but would be better if it allowed searches by flight departure/arrival time."
2012,5,Excellent. The best travel planner app ever. La migliore app per pianificare un viaggio. Ottima integrazione con Maps.
2012,4,"Features include flexible schedules, filters, +nearby, etc from the full site. Convenient way to check flights from smartphone."
2012,5,I haven't yet booked a multi city many room and car rental trip on my phone yet but everything so far indicates I will be able to...
2012,2,Not even showing Emirates airlines in options. And filters are not working well. Galaxy s II.
2012,4,This is a great tool! A low-fare calendar option would be great for researching multiple potential travel dates...
2012,4,"Wish it was a bit more flexible in finding alternate routes.  RDD - FAY, didn't show the flight that went through SFO, just came back with 'No Flights'."
2012,5,By far most convenient app. Really has the cheapest prices compared to all others. Very user friendly. Has everything!
2012,5,"I love this application. it's very easy to use, it's effective. complete with photos and the ability to book on the spot!"
2012,5,This app is fast! And ot finds the best deals. What more do you want?
2012,5,"Type a few words and they do the rest, smh never seen anything like it.. THANK YU INVENTOR  FRM:User lol"
2012,4,"I like the interface. Flight traker works, though slow in updating boarding gate number info."
2012,5,If you travel alot this is your app. Quick fast and to the point. I wont use anything else in the foreseeable future. Kayaak is all I need.
2012,4,"Quick, a lot of good features and good fares. Good for on the go quick search, not that great for travel when you have more time to plan and research fares"
2012,5,Works great. Please add option to input discount codes and you get another half a star.
2012,1,"Did not receive email confermation ~ when called for assistance csr did not understand american english to be able to locate reservation ~ took rep 20 minutes to figure out how to spell ""richard"" then I had to start spelling my last name ~ when I asked for a translator he hung up on me =("
2012,5,"Kayak app is nice. Could use a ""nearby date fares"" view. Never, ever choose Vayama to complete your purchase. After they tried to un-purchase my tickets, I had to call the carrier to re-secure my tickets. Overall, Kayak is good."
2012,5,This app makes it very simple to locate flight information and book travel directly from your phone. A must for frequent travelers.
2012,5,"All filtering options are available, works more often than other travel search apps, best prices."
2012,4,Use it often... Never disappoints. Now if you could find a way to lower prices of flights... :-)
2012,1,"With the Orbitz app I found a flight $530 less than Kayak's most ""economic"" flights using the same queries. Big FAIL."
2012,5,I use this pre-travel as well as for on-the-fly changes in plan. Do your part and check out ratings on the internet before you book. Awesome app.
2012,4,Great except use of integrated bing maps.  Lame performance on bionic.  Google maps are much better.
2012,3,Generally good app for itinerary management and trips tracking but the app doesn't seem to be able to display trips by coach/bus. They trips do get added but are just not showing on the app itself.
2012,4,Very easy to use. Appears to be accurate and concise. Good tool to use!
2012,5,Didn't find me a flight yet... Really good app excuse the sarcasm. I seems to be spot on with pricing for my carriers and gives a great overview of what's available.
2012,5,This app rocks! Only one question...where have you been all my life?! Thanks Kayak:-)
2012,5,"It has everything you need including the increasingly important list of airline ""fee's"".  Hands down the best!"
2012,1,Real a bad app. Don't get it otherwise you have to take a mortgage to fly.
2012,5,Very easy to use and has all the features you need to plan your trip. Highly recomend it!
2012,5,"Wish it included other airlines, but that isnt their fault.  well thought out user interface."
2012,5,This app has great search options. Wished it had a save options. Great app to have on the fly.
2012,5,its a great travelling tool with best prices. needs to get more airlines on the list...
2012,5,One of the best travel apps.  Easy and efficient user interface.  Price alerts are very useful.
2012,5,I could easily become addicted to this app. Wait...I already am. Very very useful!!! Thanks Kayak!
2012,4,Quick and efficient but I won't give a 5-star rating until you can search for vacations (hotel and flight).
2012,3,"The app shows everything great but when I go to buy my flight, everytime, it tells me its no longer available.. like wtf?"
2012,5,"Kayak blows skyscanner out of the water! When I fly I like to know what kind of aircraft I'll be flying on, and Kayak lets me do just that!"
2012,5,You get thr best rates znd its very easy to uso from my galaxy tablet.
2012,5,My favorite part is the My Trips feature that puts all of my trip info in one place. First rate app.
2012,4,This tool has been great for quickly searching flight prices. I still book my flights online.
2012,5,It have a lot of option. You can save the date of your trip and they send you and alert when the tickets are cheapest in the month.
2012,2,"You set the  parameters for the search, it gives you prices that look really good and when you try to make the reservations it says"" whoah the prices have changed since you made your selection"" and the prices nearly double"
2012,4,pretty quick but initially showed price then went higher. Changed sort to cheapest still there. Re_searched and clicked on cheaper price.
2012,5,"Been looking for something like this! Extremely powerfyl, user friendly, and free!^^"

2012,5,"The app is so much like the full site, that it's great. My netbook  is not the speediest of computers any longer and I prefer to search with this app for flight and hotel info."

2012,5,Great has all the thing you need for travel. Money converter and great picturea with maps.
2012,4,I tried many others like trip advisor yatra but I found yhis 10000 times better than other like it.

2012,5,I have been using kayak to search travel prices for a couple years...but this app is easier to use than there website!! I am hooked.

2012,3,Live the app... update changed the widget to one that takes up a full page.... I liked the smaller widget.  At least give me a choice.  Also price alerts are no longer saving so I dont get updates when the routes I want have goid fares.
2012,2,"The only reason I don't love this app is because I know their website is better, so I expected more from them.  The app runs well, but it's missing a couple of features. Specifically, the app doesn't have the ability to filter flight results by layover and trip duration. It seems like a small thing, but it's a feature I use regularly on the website."
2012,3,it took time to show the result and stopped workin for like half my trip when i had to make a reservation to stay at my destination.. ended up calling to make a reservation..  used it for checking other flights n hotels and it works gr8 on tht..
2012,2,I travel every week and use this for basic flight info.  Most of the time it doesn't properly track updates and delays.  I am writing this right now from DCA as my on a 2 hour delay.  This app says it's on time.  :(
2012,4,This is perfect for watching for the cheapest fares. I put a widget on my home screen and set up a few possible  combinations of flights for alerts. All I have to do is open Kayak on my phone to see up to the minute cost.  No more entering all of the info every time or wading through junk mail to find the deal.
2012,5,Love this app! It is easy to use. I've used this so many times to search for hotels and flights and I have never been disappointed. It has all the info you need to find in 1 place. This app has found a loyal user in me :)
2012,3,"I complained months ago that despite never using this app, it is ALWAYS RUNNING in the background, even after restarting the phone.  SPYWARE? BATTERY DRAIN? MEMORY HOG? Whatever, it is totally unacceptable that it's taken them this long to issue a fix. Only time will tell if there's now an improvement.  I can't believe that no-one else here has commented on this abuse of their phones resources."
2012,3,"You can not pick a hotel with the fluffs of life. All my daughter wants for her birthday is to stay the night in a hotel with a pool.  Being her birthday is normally celebrated with snow on the ground, outdoor pools are a no go.  I had to search through all the slow loading pictures until I found one with a pool with walls around it.  I had to skip over the cheaper hotels who didn't show anything but the room in the pictures but meh ..I would suggest adding a list of other things the hotels offer."
2012,1,Filters don't work. Still end up with unfiltered results. Multi-city search doesn't retain departure or arrival cities or dates so can't perform the search. Nexus S on Android 4.03 ICS.
2012,5,"After using other apps, I finally found this one, and what a difference!  Its so easy to use and the turn around time is much quicker than other apps. I also found better pricing through Kayak!"
2012,5,I don't usually ever take time to stop and rate apps but I felt compelled to here. This app is amazing at what it does. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for good deals on travel or hotels in the near future. Keep it up Kayak team!
2012,3,"If you leave the app for any reason and come back,  everything you filled in is gone. Several times I was booking a flight and somebody called me. When I finish with the call all the information I had entered was lost"
2012,3,Trip advisor has better interface but kayak has better features. Occasional freezes and doesn't show book option at times. Please fix. Samsung Gs2.
2012,2,"I can't search generally for flights to a country instead of city? do I really need to specify ""Khartoum""? this is a dumb problem to have to deal with at this stage in the game. be smart and fix it... Or relocate from mass."
2012,3,"I was happy and would give it 5 stars... But new update does not change the prices for tickets to other currency. Remains in US Dollars. I am American, but live in Brazil."
2012,4,"No big complaints.  I like that it includes American Airlines, which most of the other travel search websites don't.  Just wish it was a little more Android/phone friendly."
2012,5,"I downloaded this app and its the best. I left town at the last minute, to another state I never been to. It showed me all the deals and locations for hotels. And at a drop of a dime it had my inteinary for my departure. Love it!"
2012,4,"Certain things don't work properly sometimes, for example when tracking a flight maps won't update at all. Good application overall but needs improvements."
2012,5,Very good website. When changing your mind you do not have to correct all the time the destination place or  the dates you are leaving. The best app  I found until now . Don't screw it up with updates.
2012,5,Frequent crashes however restarts easy. Their low fare finder feature is the best in the market! Has saved me thousands!! And keeps track of your iteneraries for years. Great App!
2012,5,"Was able to book hotel room at a great discount, which came with extra discounts for food, and booked it last minute. Had to double check my discount for the food deal, which I usually do anyway. Otherwise, great app!"
2012,4,"Very, very good app, but the widget consumes too much battery and doesn't update properly in the background. But overall very useful. Good job!"
2012,5,Have used this app many times to find cheap flights. Extremely simple to use and very user friendly. lots of nice extras. The packing list is especially good. Would definitely recommend
2012,2,"It only shows spirit airline, I try 2filter the search & show multi a.l, so opened & is spirit still :[ also I compared (from computer;) online's price on same dates & online is cheaper! So what's the deal w this app?.."
2012,2,A good app but the prices shown are always in USD no matter what currency you choose in preferences. All it does is prefix the dollar price with the currency chosen in preferences. Fix it and the app would be perfect!
2012,5,"Very user-friendly and easy to use. Fast and efficient. Up-to-date times and flights. Great with flight status updates, etc. Highly recommended."
2012,4,"The app is designed for small screens.  If you have flexible dates, you can't see the date that kayak returns until you open the flight option."
2012,4,"Missing tiny features, but really annoying. For example in My trips can only add all trips to the calendar, but not a single one (and adds it to the phone calendar, but not to google...)"
2012,1,I WANT TO RENT A KAYAK AND YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THIS ON THIS APP!  UNBELIEVABLE!  U SHOULD BE SUED FOR FALSE ADVERTISING!  SHAME!  JESUS WILL PUNISH YOU FOR FOLLOWING THE WAYS OF SATAN!
2012,5,"Works well, everything you can so on the website on your laptop or PC you can do on this Android app. Are you really that surprised, its 2012 for crying out loud"
2012,4,"Great app, good enough to search flight & hotel. But if can post more hotel photos for hotel review, it ll be even better."
2012,5,"While Kayak does an awesome job helping me search for my travel needs, my favorite function is the trip tracker.  I just forward my confirmation emails and they are in my trip itinerary with links to call, track flight status, everything.  No more paper for my itinerary info when I travel.  Love it."
2012,3,"I like the application.. It's simple, intuitive, and gets me what I need most of the time.. My only problem comes when I can't connect to the Kayak server, which happens quite often."
2012,4,Great app. Would like more advanced search optiobs to keep from having 100's of flts to scroll thru. Other than that super easy. Love flt tracker!
2012,5,"I think I love this app, I have used it for hotels, flights...makes planning a trip so much easier because I can do it all with a few clicks."
2012,5,Makes selecting the best fare using different departure & arrival airports really easy. Because of other travels I had a choice of departing from any of several different west coast cities. Using Kayak it was so easy to quickly find the departure airport with the best fare to my destination. Kudos!
2012,4,"Very easy to use app with multiple ways of finding what you want. Smooth interface, lots of listings, surprised it's free!"
2012,2,Very nice interface but the only thing that works is car rentals. Hotels and flights get timed out. Almost useless.
2012,1,"Flights way over priced, car rental information horribly inaccurate.  Do your own research and save $$!"
2012,4,Some prices aren't what they are on the sites. Kayak shows like $50 cheaper but you go to site and its $50 more...but this is a great app to have to search for flights and etc
2012,4,Could use a search by any date feature.  Southwest Air is not listed. Nice speed. I recommend it.
2012,5,"This application is so easy to use. If you are some always on the go, a spontaneous traveler, or just want to plan a vacation on the go this application is for you. I like being able to check pricing anytime. Hotels, flights, and cars. Very easy. You are your own travel agent. VERY COOL."
2012,5,"I love this app. It lets you compare prices for other airports when you search which I really like.  The only thing I wish it could do, but it might be beyond the apps capability, is plan for multiple things like car and hotel or flight, car and hotel, etc.  Great app!"
2012,4,Wish they had days next to departure/arrival to show cheaper rates like the website does. No complaints otherwise.
2012,5,Fast. Easy. Simple. Very easy to use but you have to know exactly how to spell where your going it won't auto-correct or ask you if you meant something else. For instance if you are going to Hawaii and you plan to fly to Maui...typing in Maui will yield no results but OGG which is the abbreviation for Maui's only airport gets you what you need.
2012,5,"This App works great. When I'm looking for the best travel schedules and pricing options, Kayak easily provides the information I need._"
2012,4,"Widget doesn't work really well and takes up too much space, the calendar feature is kindof annoying but all in all does what its supposed to do which is find cheap flights."
2012,5,"Wish orbitz, priceline and expedia would get with the program and allow all search functions like Kayak. wth is the point of only allowing hotel searches on the app when people use your service for flights, cars etc. Don't create it unless you include everything! :) Again very nice app A-"
2012,5,This is an excellent app. It allows you to search by many different options including price range. It connects to a gps map so you can see locations of hotels. I love it.
2012,5,I use it on my tablet for business travel weekly. I like the portability and easy of not needing to pull out a laptop. VERY glad the week starts with Sunday now. I made a mistake once where I thought i picked Tuesday but actually picked Wednesday instead...
2012,4,"great service, but design doesn't go well with ICS, graphics and semantics are for iPhone.  please update according to the guidelines."
2012,5,First time searching for a flight on my phone. Just hoping to get an idea so I could book one later at home. It was so easy that I was done in minutes.
2012,2,"Flight prices needs to be constantly updated. search always quoted good prices but when we decide to book, app will bring to e ticketing agent, which will then says e fare is now unavailable n e price is now *more*. this is bad coz people will feel cheated this way."
2012,4,This app of very handy. Prices of flights keep changing constantly and this app keep a tab on them.   It would haver been nice if they can get the date scrolling to work better.
2012,1,Lucky if i get one hotel search before it refuses to find any more results. Waste of time so I will be uninstalling. Avoid.
2012,5,Ive been using it  everyday to check prices and this app makes it so easy to do so with price alerts. It gives you many choices on how you can narrow your searches. Love this app
2012,5,You guys knocked it out of the park with this one. This should be the bench mark to improve upon! Thanks keep up the innovation
2012,5,I gave an earlier version a bad review. The problems seem to have all been fixed. Great app for travelers.
2012,1,"Doesn't work!  Begins to load flights but then screen goes blank and ""no flights found"" message appears.  It finds the flights but then dumps them.  Useless!!!"
2012,5,Easy interface. Fast results. I can't think of any knocks on this app.
2012,5,"I really enjoy this app. Its user friendly, works great. Couldn't ask for anything better."
2012,4,I haven't booked anything but they tell you prices from everyone else. Who does that unless they are an honest deal?
2012,4,Good app but widget way to big. Needs whole screen. Old one ised 1line. Go back to old one!!!
2012,4,"Good, fast, efficient. (only BUT is, that it doesn't always find EVERY airline, that works better on their webpage!)"
2012,4,This is the only app that covers multi destinations.  Thank you. I don't know experientially how well it covers hotel info.
2012,5,Found the cheapest flights to China... Have been looking for weeks. Love kayak! And the app is simple to use although I didn't try to book the whole thing through the app... Just searched for the flights
2012,5,Gotta love a cheeky bit of Kayak on your phone. 5/5 good work.
2012,4,"For a travel app its not bad. A little more ease of checking alerts, I would give 5 stars but overall its a great resource for comparing prices and available flights while on the move."
2012,5,"This always a helpful app. Especially when you have a canceled flight, you can actually tell the airline what other flights are available."
2012,3,Screen goes black when I try and type in the airport or city using 'Flight' search. Galaxy nexus
2012,5,Amazing app allows you to quickly check prices AND it remembers the last locations you selected. Thanks!
2012,5,1st time user and its so simple and easy to use that I.can recommend it to the oldest or youngest of my friends. Plus its fast to retrieve the information.
2012,5,Probably the most thought out app I've seen for a phone. In some ways better than kayak online.
2012,5,This app is really useful when your on the move you can keep track off all your travel planed in one app. Gives you good rates too. definitely recommend it
2012,4,"Helpful, like the new menu because its easier to navigate. Also runs faster than previous version"
2012,5,"very helpful! Just to check, I opened up other windows on my laptop to check the integrity of Kayak and they were accurate. Don't waste your time, just use Kayak."
2012,5,With my boyfriend graduating and me staying in school its great to b  able to check the cost of flights so quickly and easily. And a great way to find a good deal
2012,4,Eats my battery a little bit but other then that...fast and super easy to use. Scroll is a little annoying.
2012,4,"Its works great fast updates, good layout, useful, but does not list all airlines."
2012,3,"Wanting to be a one stop shop, not required. Over 9MB app...though has  GateGuru access which is over 8MB so it saves that!"
2012,5,"Well designed, practical app. I am loving my Android phone, and  apps like this is one of the reasons why."
2012,5,"Excellent resource, summarizes all the airlines quickly.  Very easy and clear to use. I like the way you can filter and sort according to desired need. Very Good."
2012,5,"Easy to see options in air travel, accommodations, cars, etc.-- and information is accurate. Good app."
2012,4,"App works fine, but it would be awesome if it would show the calendar with the best prices on different dates like the site does."
2012,5,Has very up tp date prices and comparisons. We just booked a trip to munich for oktoberfest and used kayak for months to track prices. Great app.
2012,5,I recently download on my anroid device ..very good to use and it is a complate features about travelling...nice and must have ...
2012,4,"App doesn't save your last airport pair search,  even in the same session.  Otherwise I always use Kayak first before Airline websites."
2012,4,Just general pricing. Fast speed. Lots of options.
2012,4,Very easy. Searches multiple sites. Plus allows me to track mine or any other flights progress. A+
2012,4,"It posters for a review - so I have yet to take a trip. But the info for cars, cities, flights, hotels etc for some of my pasts trips is spot on."
2012,4,Great for getting idea on the go of some future travel plans. The date button and other detail features little touchy though
2012,5,Makes hotel searches simple and intuitive.  Very good interface.  Love this app!
2012,5,ITS A QUICK AND CONVINIENT WAY TO EXPLORE ALL THE OPTION. A REAL TIME SAVER..
2012,4,Displays the majority of travel websites to help you make an informed decision.  Very user friendly!
2012,4,"No problems, not dazzling.  Serviceable and simple.  Very functional."
2012,5,I installed it a while ago and frankly forgot about it.  After using several other sites and coming back to Kayak ...what a difference!  I won't stray again ....
2012,5,"If your looking for a great travel App , this is it. Absolutely great for hunting down a great deal!!!"
2012,4,"Love Kayak and enjoy the app, but would really like to be able to use the widget on the Galaxy Nexus."
2012,5,"This is the slickest, quickest and most efficient of any mobile travel research apps i've used! thanks!"
2012,4,"Nice app, is anyone else not able to see the widget in the add list? - HTC Legend 2.2"
2012,5,Keeps all my travel info in one place. Searches are fast and the interface its a joy to use.
2013,3,No longer runs after i updated. Terrible.
2012,5,App works great - better than using the website on a pc to browse air fare options.
2012,4,"Excellent apps, the only prob i have is while searching for flight, many times cannot reach 100% eventhough i use wifi."
2012,4,Great ap; allows searching nearby airports or nearby dates (some difficulty when allowed too much flexibility)
2012,5,Does what its supposed to. Helps me find flight deals and arrival/departure times.
2012,5,"I'm a regular Kayak user, so this app makes things even easier for me."
2012,2,"Searched flights, saw results stacking up, then got an 'Oops, search failed' message as search progress hit 100%. Every time."
2012,4,If this allowed for flexible dates it would get 5 stars.  Other than that it is great.
2012,4,"Need to be able to lock in approximate flight times wanted also. Maybe it's there, I just haven't found it."
2012,4,"Pretty good I interface , but some pointless features. 4/5"
2012,5,"The price alert function within in this app, helped me save over $400 while planning & booking my family's trip! Not only did it find me the best price & site to buy from, it also let me know when it got better!!!"
2012,5,Works great & good for on the go travel! Track your trips & what you need & times!
2012,5,"Solid app.  Doesn't force close.  Easy to use,  and features are straightforward."
2012,1,"Seems to be the best application but for flights from London to India when we change currency from US$ to GBP, it changes only currency symbol..not amount..fix this to get 5 stars.."
2012,5,Easy to search and filter results. App is better than the mobile website so proves its worth
2012,5,The app is good. I can read understand and book from my phone. I recommend it.
2012,5,Seems easier to use than the computer version!  Love it on my DROID bionic.
2012,5,Very easy to navigate for both occasional travelers and long time kayak members. A must have for anyone with an upcoming trip or for the one that wants to watch prices over a few months/weeks before buying.
2012,5,"Great app! Easy to use..user friendly, comprehensible interface! Love it!"
2012,1,Cheaper pricing on Wotflight  for same airline same flights by $3000.00! Filters selectionsnot saved. Uninstalling.
2012,5,Easy to use.
2012,5,"Works great on my HTC Thunderbolt! Easy to use, accurate, well designed mobile app! Great!"
2012,4,I would say that I like to keep this app handy in my phone.
2012,5,Makes searching multiple airports and price shopping a breeze! Use often for business and pleasure. No need to look any farther.
2012,4,I love being able to see flights over a week/month/year so I can make sure I get a fair price!
2012,5,It works great and it is easy and fast. Very glad I downloaded it!  :-)
2012,4,Just started to use and so far no bugs or crashes. Like the interface and ease of use.
2012,4,Missing flexible travel. I hate money hungry people. Those of you informed will know what I'm talking about.
2012,3,Great speed but needs more features like map radius search...or search for hotel by name
2012,4,"App is easy to use, and returns accurate information quickly."
2012,5,"Very clean interface, good performance even on my low-end phone"
2012,4,"Excellent app, wish there was an option to add children as passengers, instead of just adults. Apart from that excellent app"

2012,5,Works great. Great prices. I have only used for flights though.
2012,5,"Works like a dream. didn't know how they would contain the greatness of kayak in an app, but works better than I could have hoped."
2012,1,"This app wants access to all your private data (phone book, call log,...) Sad thimg is that it shouldn't need any of this information to work properly."
2012,4,Has some weird display issues on Acer Iconia A200 running ICS. Screen goes white and will only be restored if I switch to a different app and then switch back.
2012,5,"Excellent, got better pricing, more options than Cheapoair. Highly recommend to everyone."
2012,4,Very nice but I don't see a track this flight option. Or it's just me.
2012,4,"Very user friendly, simple and appeasing to the eye."

2012,5,I love it. You don't have to go on the internet to check out prices. It saves so much time
2012,2,Filtering results doesn't work (by time or airline) - results always the same.  Often freezes on me.
2012,5,I use kayak when searching for flights and is extremely easy to use. I also just took a trip to Las Vegas from Los Angeles and booked the hotel same day on the road using this app.

2012,4,"I always use Kayak to search for flights.  Its great for searching.  However, when choosing to book a flight Kayak sends you to the full website of the ticket seller.  Full websites on mobile devices are rough to deal with.  Maybe in a couple years when mobile devices can handle full websites better Kayak will get rated with 5 stars."
2012,4,"Quick and ready to use.  Intuitive reasoning and logical choices when using android version. Have found some great pricing, just snatch it up when get them cause they usually don't come around twice."
2012,5,"I love Hipmunk, but the Kayak mobile app combines best search, best booking and best features. The My Trip feature is convenient and much neater than a print out, the currency converter is smooth and flight tracking is very handy.  Now all it needs is some very smooth Google Calendar integration, maybe a loyalty membership repository and that'll be the end of it."
2012,1,"Current release runs in background eating the battery with wifi active. Doesn't show in running procs, but force stop is available (though useless). Htc G2"
2012,1,App starts by itself even after phone reboot. Drains battery and uses wifi even though I didn't start app. What does it need 3.5 hrs of wifi for if I dont open it?
2012,5,Already booked two flights with this.  So easy to use and filtering options really help.  Prices are low and competitive.  No comment on other searches like hotel and cars... haven't tried. A+
2012,4,"This app was so easy to use, search and filter that anyone could do it. My only gripe is there dosent seem to be as big of a hotel selection as just using Google maps on my pc."
2012,4,Now the searches work all the time. App notifications never seem to work though. Had to change my price alerts to use email. HTC Evo
2012,5,"5 stars. Easy to use, finds great deals quickly, and excellent filter options. Filter land/depart times, price, nearby airports, number of layovers, total travel time, and more."
2012,5,Great for comparing fares and for selecting the schedule that best fits your needs. Hundreds of schedules and price options presented. Easy-to-use application.
2012,5,"So many useful features: airport directory, airline phone # list, packing checklist, plus near-universal search results. Well done."
2012,4,"Great for finding cheap hotels, however, it doesnt find you the cheapest flights. Airlines are of a limited selection. Overall good app to have! :)"
2012,5,very easy to use!  it has a nice feature that saves the information of searching flights.  great for checking the same flight to find the best price.
2012,3,It's okay! Other sites not listed have better prices. App does what its suppose to and I havent had a problem with it at all.
2012,5,Simple interface and fast app. Lot of options to filter and sort results and save searches.  Ability to book directly with airline or hotel. Great for comparing rates
2012,5,Reach for my phone before even using desktop version.  Helps book trips anytime and anywhere!
2012,5,"Kayak is great to begin with (my go to travel website), but strangely I think it's faster on my phone (than my PC), which makes it even better. Yay!"
2012,4,"Nice app, too bad Flight tracker doesn't work. I try it on many current flights with no results. should work on correcting that issue."
2012,4,Very fast and simple to use. Easy to go back one step and make changes to see how those changes affect the results.
2012,5,"Works like a charm. Wish it had more flexibility in searching broad date ranges, but gets the job done well."
2012,2,"Sometimes takes multiple tries to get it to register a departing date and allow you to enter a return date.  Shifting between months on date choice screen doesn't work sometimes, too"
2012,1,Keeps running in background even though I never start it after a reboot. Consumes 24% of my battery. Must uninstall to save battery life.
2012,1,Battery munching advertising junk that keeps reloading itself even after you kill it. Uninstall or leavw your phone on charge
2012,2,"When this app is not running, its still running in the background and draining my battery even after a phone reboot. HTC EVO 3D"
2012,5,Great for comparing prices. Plenty of sorting options to narrow your search! Way to go Kayak
2012,5,"Great app! However, it would also be more than perfect if we all can book vacation packages like the full site. Ibiza is the next trip!"
2012,2,"This AM I noticed kayak used 20% of CPU time over the previous 11 hours. I was logged in, but kayak should have had nothing to do during that time."
2012,5,Works great! Quick and easy.... def recommend this to anyone looking to constantly tracking trips
2012,5,"So far the best travel app I have tried. Has rental cars, flight tracker and everything else I need."
2012,2,"The whole thing is sluggish, but that doesn't matter if you are using it on a WiFi enabled plane, because it wont let you do anything when airplane mouse is enabled."
2012,5,Easy to use and quick.  Really takes all of tge log work put of planning for a trip by searching multiple search engines at once.  Love it!
2013,5,"Works the same way as the full site, at least for flights!  Ultimately, I still prefer viewing the full site on a computer."
2012,1,"Hangs at 99% ... Never, ever returns results. Renders the mobile app useless. Hope this is a minor hiccup."
2012,5,I used  the website alot. Happy to see a mobile version.Have already booked flights and hotels!
2012,5,Just what i'm looking for. Fast search & nice interface too. Highly recommended for travelers. :-)
2012,4,Its kinda quick n my kids didn't have to show their caveman dad how to use it.
2012,4,"Everything you need right from my phone! Quick & easy, love it."
2012,5,As the title implies. Would like to save searches on phone.
2012,5,App saves me so much time. Forget orbitz n priceline or whatever. This finds cheapest of all of them.
2012,2,"Although a decent app, I have run into the problem many times of flights either being listed at search as a different price then purchase price, or simply not existing."
2012,4,Always extremely useful. Gotten some great deals because of this.
2012,1,"I haven't used this app in weeks, yet it kept my phone awake for the last nine hours"
2012,3,not sure why this application is draining my battery more than any other on my device
2012,4,"Ability to generate info speedily and provide cross comparisons for almost (if not all) every destination and airline, makes this app more than worth the time."
2012,5,Due to my line of business i travel 3 to 4 times per month. Kayak application is always here to support  Galaxy s2
2012,5,Great app. Works fast. Very user friendly.
2012,5,"Works just great! One way, round trip and long around the world trips. Just great!"
2012,4,but i wish there was an easier way to save flights / hotels and things -- maybe I jus haven't found it yet lol - great design tho love the visuals
2012,4,Great APP so far....have only used it once but it was much faster & simpler than using a full website on my HTC DROID  Incredible.
2012,1,Also needs access to your personal info.
2012,4,Really great app. It would be amazing of there was a way to add a notification when a flight price is in my price zone
2012,3,"Has a flight tracker. It works, but is slow and sloppy."
2012,5,Background process using 20% of my battery and keeping my phone awake since update. Please fix!
2012,3,"I like the price alert feature, but something must have happened during an upgrade - all my saved alerts disappeared or were deleted."
2012,1,Request the permission to read and modify(!) contact and calendar information. unbecoming.
2012,3,Like it. Simple to use and gets me the information and prices I'm looking for.
2012,1,"Honolulu to Papeete ... it offered a $2025 coach fare via Seattle, San Jose, and LA."
2012,5,Use it a lot. Works great. Best app for traveling.
2012,4,"Great app.  Fast,  easy to use.  Lacks some local airlines, once that gets fixed a 5 star app."
2012,5,Fast and accurate.  It's the easiest way to find the best flight deals for me.
2012,4,I've used the app many times. Love it. Easy to use and gets the info you need quickly.
2012,1,Eats up battery and I never use the app.  So it's getting uninstalled
2012,2,"Eventhough not in use, drains your battery under your eyes. Had to uninstall."
2012,4,Very user friendly! Like it alot
2012,4,Very good.  but it should have ability to screen only non-stop flights instead of sorting them out.
2012,3,Having an issue with Galaxy Nexus ICS 4.0. Keeps resetting to defaults.
2012,5,This is a great app. Very easy to use.
2012,5,"Sensible and sophisticated app. Remembers where I left off and gives me easy access to my history. Clean, attractive, intuitive design."
2012,5,"I love that I can just forward my email itineraries, and it syncs my trips with the app...makes flight tracking easy and fun!"
2012,5,Very good travel app. Works great on Galaxy Nexus.
2012,5,"Great app for adhoc travel plan checking.  Wish Jet Blue could be added back as one of the airlines, where did they go?"
2012,5,Awesome app! Big time-saver and finds the best deals.
2012,5,Really helped me find the best deals! I'd recommend it.
2012,4,Great app! Keep up the updates
2012,5,Everything right at your fingertips. Remembers previous selections for price comparisons. Love it!
2012,5,Hands down the best traveling app I have come across. Super easy and quick.
2012,5,"I absolutely love that you can not only look for flights & share them in an email, but you can also book it right there!"
2012,5,The mobile app is more straightforward and easier to use than the site. Great download!
2012,5,Great app...wish it had more international airlines.   but lots of great great features.
2012,5,"Get app ! Very handy and its free :-) cud not live with out it, so down load it now, works great on ma x10"
2012,3,If you travel a lot this is a good app. It takes up a lot of space relative to other apps but I think it is nice.
2012,5,The best app for flight searches!  Keep it up. HTC desire
2012,5,My favorite travel site. Easy to use. Best flight & hotel rates.
2012,5,Great app. My personal favorite for finding flights. Its fast as searching on the computer
2012,4,Easy to use. Good info.
2012,4,Works as good as the regular site. #win
2012,3,It's ok but currency set in dollars. There is a converter but not when viewing actual prices.Not convinced it picks the town instead of airport either
2012,5,Just downloaded and started using it. So far it's a piece of cake. I anticipate using this often.
2012,5,Very easy to use! Not complicated.
2012,4,Thanks for starting a change log.Droid X
2012,5,Just started using it. Very easy to use. Excellent app
2012,5,Great app with an easy interface. Should have an option for seniors flight tickets.
2012,1,"App that I hardly use, but it insists on constantly running in background. Uninstall!"
2012,3,"Not so happy, I expected more!"
2012,5,"Smooth UI, very fast, clean. A model app."
2012,5,So easy to use. Accurate! Great prices. Easy to sort and filter!
2012,5,"The best all inclusive travel app for frugal spenders. Alerts,trackers,reservations. Awesome job!"
2012,5,"Works great, fast and for free!"
2012,5,Straight forward and simple to use.   No college degree necessary
2012,5,Works perfect everytime.. also gotten great deals from it..
2012,5,Great and convenient app to have. A must have travel tool for everybody.
2012,5,Works great on my galaxy so far!
2012,5,This the best for me.  So simple and flexible.   You can't go wrong with this app!!!
2012,5,"Best app for finding flights I've found. Really easy to use, but I've never used it to purchase tickets yet."
2012,5,One if the best apps I have used!  Successfully  reformats the website to a usable smartphone application.
2012,5,Will be traveling more. So handy!
2012,5,I can be able to check for deals. Awesome app.
2012,5,I have always liked Kayak! Very easy searches...
2012,4,"Excellent and easy app also its very fast to find option of flight please if you need it,download it."
2012,5,I love this app. Thank you kayak !!!!!!!! Love you so much.
2012,5,Best way of finding tickets right here....faster than any other app ive used...deff worth downloading
2012,5,No more do I have to wait on hold or in a line for a car rental hotel or flight great app if you do have it now you better get it
2012,4,Very handy and simple.
2012,5,The Kayak app works well.
2012,4,Love the app but excessive battery drain. Uninstalled.
2012,5,Extremely easy to use. Very helpful app.
2012,4,Hangs in 99% when finding results once in a while otherwise I use this app everyday!
2012,5,Simplicity at its best! Saves you more money than the rest!
2012,3,"Using other sites, I have found flights cheaper than Kayak."
2012,5,Works very well and is very fast even on a 3G phone.
2012,4,"I like using it for impromptu flights, however I'd like to see an improvement for first and business class."
2012,5,Very helpful and fast! Thanks a lot
2012,4,Fast and simple to use! Booked my flight and hotel with no problems!
2012,4,"But I'd like to be able to add to the list of nearby airports, not just subtract from it."
2012,4,"Historically buggy, but always improving.  Becoming valuable trip companion"
2012,4,All features provided as in computer version
2012,4,Works fine.
2012,4,"Search flights, hotels, etc., AND track your flight, get alerts on fare changes and more."
2012,3,Cool app I just wish there were no ads always at the bottom of my the screne
2012,4,Would've been 5 stars if i could do an advance search
2012,4,"Fast, easy to use and has helpful features for traveling such as airport guides."
2012,5,I love it. Very easy to navigate. Great comparison shopping is great.
2012,5,..اقوي برنامج... للحجز.... تم الحجز منه على ريدو جونيرو...
2012,4,It's can't search in multi flights if u try with 4 and more.
2012,4,Some issues at receiving price alerts and keeping them in thr system.
2012,4,Miss the recent prices that others have purchased that is on the main web site.
2012,1,"Keeps saying device is in airplane mode.... no, it's not..."
2012,3,"Good App, but drains my battery when not in use."
2012,5,Works great.  One stop shopping.
2012,4,Wish I could check flights by cheapest tickets available anywhere.....
2012,4,See subject ..no 5 since I feel they cld of used Google maps
2012,5,Love it. Easy to use. Lots of choices
2012,5,I could be wrong but I think Kayak is the best way to book non-Southwest airlines flights.
2012,5,Works well.
2012,5,"Fast, stable, easy to use and all the search/filter/sort functionality one would need. SGS2"
2012,4,You need app if you travel a lot and like to save money
2012,4,Good app but its could be better
2012,4,One of the more thought out apps on the market
2012,5,"Great app if you do any traveling. Simple, smooth and reliable!"
2012,4,I really like how helpful this app is. I found some good prices.
2012,5,One of the best apps to have if traveling is your thing...
2012,5,Amazingly good app! I've never been impressed enough to leave a rating until now
2012,4,DID NOT FIND CHEAP PRICES BUT FOUND MANY FLIGHTS
2012,3,decent app but has several error pop ups
2012,4,Easier than website but sometimes shows that their are no flights.
2012,4,Wish there was a option to do flight and hotel together though.
2012,4,"Does what it is supposed to, apparently we are celebrating that now days"
2012,5,Great app tp use. Easier to use than any other apps.
2012,5,Been searching flights all other ways. Kayak found us rates and great flights.
2012,5,Simple to use. Loads fast. Love this.
2012,4,Missing some functionality that is available on the web site.
2012,5,"Does what it should. It's nicely done, and I'd recommend."
2012,4,"it's good, while layover options in filter would be very useful"
2012,1,This drains my battery in the background and it's not running.
2012,5,"Everything from car, flights, hotel, and flight status for all airlines. No complaints!"
2012,5,Works as advertised... Pretty darn good
2012,4,Easy to use but doesnt have all airlines.

2013,5,Esta de peluche sigan así
2012,3,Ok needs help
2012,5,Works as well as website!
2012,5,Every App should be like this!
2012,5,Super app!!
2012,5,I always look up on this site
2012,3,I like it
2012,4,Does it right
2012,3,Average
2012,5,Does what In it to do.

2011,2,"I really like this app but the widget sucks.  Very poor use of space, using an entire row for the Kayak banner and then instead of a line of text to tell you the fare, date, and airline (or a couple of lines if relevant) it tries to display large graphics.  It also needs to integrate the flight tracker and the price checker.  While the notification interval can be daily or weekly, the price checker interval is locked at every two hours (I'd like to set it to daily or twice a day).  It may be alright if you've got an entire screen but if you've got half a screen don't bother."
2011,1,"Your ""apology"" was sounding good until the lightning rod remark. Could have left it at deal expired and didn't renew, but you showed true colors. True bigoted colors. I downloaded just to 1 star and let you know I will never use your services."
2011,1,"This app starts on boot and use up battery and memory even when you do not use it. Maybe it also sends other data, who knows? Does not matter if the app is good or bad, uninstall until this behavior is removed!"
2012,2,Kayak notification is always in my notification bar because it updates every 2 hours.  I have the widget on my main screen so I don't need it cluttering up my notification bar also. I hate to delete this widget but I have to until this is fixed. It is just too annoying!
2011,4,i use kayak mainly to get quick pricing on flights and flight options.  very easy and quick!  request - recall previous filters and settings...
2011,4,Works fine to lookup flights. I haven't actually booked anything yet so that's why i only gave it 4/5 stars. Good app
2012,1,Searches for hotels in San Jose on Kayak online works fine and pulls up several options. Search via the app says no hotels available.
2012,1,Will not find ANY flights... so I double checked one of my pre existing reservation many seats available and it would not find a flight... useless uninstall
2011,2,No real time data for small fights or airports.  No options for the widget.  Consumes to much resources.  Don't bother.
2011,1,This app is insultingly slow and ineffective. It's a pretty shoddy port of the iPhone app. When will devs learn that Android is not ios?!
2011,5,"Booked our entire trip to Disney World through this app. The kids are going to be surprised on christmas morning! Great deals, don't look Rosenstein."
2011,2,"Widget text is too big for widget, and the status bar icon needs an option to toggle off. DROID x"
2011,1,App crashes randomly. UI is slow and an awful and lame iOS port. Widget is needlessly big (Uses an entire screen)
2011,1,Used to be good app.  Now tells me no flights found or hotels found no matter dates or location after lengthy search time.  Please fix.
2011,2,I kept getting the no results found error too after I installed the update . I reinstalled to see if that will help. We'll see.
2011,1,I got charged by Kayak and the hotel. Kayak wanted a copy of my credit card statement to remove the charges. I told them hell no. Deleted the app asap.
2011,3,"Its a great tool when it works. Lots of ""oops"" messages and dump errors from my Google 4G phone."
2012,1,I always encounter a bug deeming this app unusable. When selecting depart and return dates I can never get return to select it usually selects depart thirty times and maybe once return will pop up.
2011,5,"Great app. I love to be able to find what i need, travel wise, from my phone. I can get whatever i need."
2011,2,"This used to work OK, but keeps freezing at 99% so is effectively a waste of time. Please fix, I will test again tomorrow and uninstall if no better."
2011,3,Great flight tracker. Wish the price quotes would alert me on better deals but I may not be using it right.
2011,4,Very useful app but should include the current country currency or an option to choose the currency. Great one after all.
2012,5,"Minimalistic and, extremely user-friendly UI, and is on the dot. Compared to this, Expedia feels like stone age."
2011,1,App freezes and 99 percent complete how could they let this happen?? Such an obvious flaw should be fixed by now.
2011,1,The price quoted isn't the actual price you'll pay. Had a room jump from 125 to 200 a night and this was before the service fees
2012,1,Whole propose of kayak is to find flights. Will rate again when/if you fix bugs but for now it's a big 0.....
2011,1,"I tried to select my home city to find a flight,and it says no results. Apparently Atlanta airport isn't big enough??"
2011,1,I love this app. But that ridiculous non-apology Kayak made over American Muslim? Sucks hard. Uninstalling.
2011,1,Ckane Wont do anything after new update. Worthless! Dont download it yall
2011,5,Even more intuitive than the Desktop version. Looking forward to fun future features.
2011,4,...works like a charm...and always at my fingertips! I really love it and use it all the time!
2011,1,Can't kill this app. Always running in background.  Avoid.
2011,5,Awesome! To have all this info and not have to be on my laptop. At times it can be a little slow but its a minor oversight. :)
2011,5,Works well every time. Lots of features. Reliable app.
2011,5,It's so easy to use and gives accurate flight information every time. I use it everytime I need info.
2011,1,"Didn't work at all. Just came back with ""No flights found"" same search on web got pages of results."
2011,5,"This app Does everything! Low fares Alerts, tracking your flights, wow!"
2011,5,It works as good as in the PC and helps me find good deals on the go!
2011,1,"Actions have consequences, Kayak."
2012,5,Use it almost exclusively for flight searches. All the bells and whistles of the website.
2011,5,"This app has made my travel planning much much more efficient and cheaper.  Only complaint is sometimes when I search on ipad app, I get diff results."
2011,5,"This app has everything a traveler needs (packing lists, email itineraries and smooth synching, travel alerts, flight search, weather info) = all free"
2011,3,"Seems to crash a lot with ""oops"" message.  Also, when searching for 4 seats, it finds flights with less than 4 seats available."
2011,4,When displaying the location of your hotel it does not allow an option to navigate to the hotel.
2011,1,Uninstalling for pulling the ads off TLC n then a haughty follow up from  Birge. Plz hire a better CMO.
2011,3,Its a good app worth downloading just a shame it didnt work well in finding out bout uk flights it seemed mainly american based which is a shame
2011,1,Kayak thinks no one flies between Denver and Seattle. Either app is broken or all airlines out of business.
2011,1,KAYAK can give in to religious zealots. I can uninstall their app from all my devices.
2011,5,Love it. Planning our honeymoon and getting what we want right from our phone.
2011,5,Great app. Super easy to use and very convienient. And always finds the cheapest prices!! Awesome.
2011,1,"NOT WORTH THE DOWNLOAD DOES NOT HAVE THE COMPARE THE FEATURE, GO TO THE WEBSITE IT IS MUCH BETTER.  ADD THE COMPARE FEATURE & RATING WILL INCREASE."
2012,5,Worried great on Atrix and galaxy s.
2011,4,Works well. No complaints
2011,1,showing non-terrorist muslims = lightning rod? ridiculous...uninstalled.
2011,1,WTF couldn't find a hotel for the weekend with this app. Please fix it know your better than this.
2011,1,Never returned a flight for any city pairs. Pitiful app.
2011,1,Opens all the time and requires too many permissions.  Can't make it stop opening at unwanted times.
2011,2,Found great price but wouldn't let me book it once I got to the site.
2011,5,Very good and easy to use. Could do with direct flight only tabs. All in all good free app
2011,1,Will not track flights - search comes up empty for flights I can verify other ways.
2011,4,Love the app....Who cares about them pulling the ads from that muslim show...were in the usa....Great job Kayak.....!
2011,1,Developer is stooooopid
2011,2,Oops... Try again...
2011,5,Love this app.  Super fast and easy to use.
2011,1,Used to work great but no longer returns results. It is now worthless.
2011,1,Kayak is a douchebag company. Im uninstalling and never using their website.
2011,4,Does not update sometimes
2011,1,Every time I search it always comes back and says no results found.
2013,5,Can't live without it!  Makes booking travel so easy!
2011,2,Gs2 tmo. Every time I search I get a opps message.
2012,2,"You shoukd be able to load it without all these,permissions"
2012,4,Does everything as advertised...makes it super easy to search for the best deals
2011,3,"Sadly I do get stuck at 99% as well, Samsung GS2."
2011,1,Couldn't get it to return any flights. Uninstalling for now.
2011,4,Doesn't save multi-destination searches but still convenient and great!
2011,3,Only wished that it would show all airlines.
2011,5,"Love it!!!!! Great Ap for me since I travel alot, no more looking on the internet for rooms."
2011,4,I use it a lot to check prices!! Very up to date!!
2012,1,Can't support a company that succumbs to the pressure of bigots
2011,1,I keep getting a message saying oops request failed.
2012,1,I don't support bigoted organizations.
2011,1,I won't do business with racists.
2012,4,"Best and easiest app to compare the best deals on flights, hotels, car rentals, etc..."
2011,5,Great way to look up prices for a long ways away trip! All the flights are there for you to view.
2011,5,"5 star for kayak pulling ads from American Muslim, show is boring anyway, why pay for ads if no one is watching the show."
2011,4,"Sometimes freezes at 99%, but I love this app."
2012,5,Great to find an app as good as the website. Trip planner is fantastic.
2011,1,"Rubbish,  even when working too expensive. Uninstall"
2011,4,Could be better with SWA visibility.
2011,1,Not Working..keeps saying no flight found
2011,2,"It doesn't work anymore, it says oops or wateva"
2011,5,"Works just like the website, but easier on my droid!"
2011,1,"Even though I only use it once a month, this app is always running. Why?"
2012,5,"Love it! My favorite part is the flight tracker, very accurate."
2011,5,Excellent apps...just used it to track my flight and gate information and it was precise...going to delete gate guru.
2011,1,Uninstalled as started to run in background and no settings to stop it.
2011,5,Great App.
2012,4,Easy to use and love the flight tracker feature.
2012,4,Flight tracker is very useful!
2011,5,Who cares about the company...rate the app not the company. Great app.
2011,5,LOL @ the high and mighty's below!
2011,5,I like the ability to filter out connecting airports you wish to avoid.
2011,5,"Honestly, the only reason I have to use this app is for the packing list and I love how easy it is to use."
2011,5,"This app its great, I currently use it  for booking hotel and flights, but it is really nice for tracking flights."
2011,2,Would love it if it didn't keep forcing me to close!!!!
2011,5,"Very easy to use app, always fast & very informative."
2011,5,"Great apps, it help me to save a lot of money, and time."
2012,5,"Great app, almost all airlines available."
2011,5,"Works well, no problems!"
2011,5,Really good application is help me a lot for my family and I. Thanks kayak
2011,5,Its nice to be able to look up a flight and compare  on your phone and book it.
2011,4,Excellent source for all things travel.
2011,5,As good as web site.
2011,1,Fails every search.
2012,4,Like the app but where is the widget? All the other app widgets are in my list but no Kayak.
2012,5,love the time of departure filters
2012,4,It doesnt give you prices in the currency you select
2012,5,"Excellent, very usefull app."
2011,2,No search results. Stops at 99%
2011,1,Little customization options makes this pointless
2011,5,Works great!
2011,5,"Love it, thank you Kayak...Droid Razr"
2011,5,"Plan, price, organize, fly. This single app does it all."
2011,1,App keeps popping up in drop down
2011,5,Kayak is an excellent travel app for airfare research.
2011,1,Always no results. Something wrong.
2011,5,I will never use anything else again!
2011,5,The only travel planner you'll ever need :)
2011,5,Very easy to use.
2011,5,Warned me before the airline did that my flight was cancelled.  Gave me an advantage rebooking.
2011,5,So easy and intuitive.
2011,2,Suddenly stopped connecting.
2011,4,Helpful
2011,5,Great app for flights
2011,2,Does not work for austria
2011,5,"Great, easy to use resource"

2011,1,Constant updates
2011,5,Kayak
2012,5,Kayak
2012,5,Works well
2011,3,Just downloaded the app today and it lets you put in your request but never gives you the results. I tried to look up hotels and flights.  It hangs at 99% for SEVERAL minutes. I'm sure it would be useful once fixed.  I have a Samsung Admire. Android (Gingerbread)
2011,2,"App crashes frequently. Buttons disappear. Notification always in taskbar. Search options lacking for ""world cities"". Animations and UI need work."
2012,5,"I was w/o hotel in Key West & on 2G connection. Thanks to kayak, I had a great room sorted out in minutes. Great base line for air travel prices also. Thx!"
2011,1,You would think a major developer would make sure it works before releasing.  Same as everyone... Hangs @ 99%
2011,5,Great to make that quick search to see if fares have changed on the go.  I have not tried to book through it yet.  Stable app on HTC Incredible.
2011,1,I'm having the same problem as a lot of the other reviews. It goes to 99% and then freezes. I've performed the search a number of times with no luck
2011,1,"It can't find results for a hotel in key largi? Come on now, any site will show over 15 hotels available. This was a waste of space!"
2011,5,Thanks. One thing to improve is synchronization of my flight alerts with web version. I have about 25 and the Android app shows zero...
2011,4,Works well for the most part. Some searches take a long time. The price alert feature is nice to use.
2011,1,"I use HTC thunderbolt phone. The application does not find hotels, flight , etc. Please do not waste time downloading this app."
2011,3,"TripAdvisor found the same rt flight for less, and it took a fraction of the time. Crashes often too. Not sure how much I will use this....needs some work."
2011,3,"Experiencing crashes when I try to remove or edit a flight. Aside from this, a good app. Gives me the information I need."
2011,4,This app works flawlessly. I appreciate the app saving my trip so all I have to do is open it up and tap the search flights for fast results.
2011,4,Thanks to Todds review it works and I upped my rating of the app.  Thanks again Todd. If you all actually fix the app I'll change it to 5
2011,5,I've used kayak for years and have always been happy with it. Its great to now have it with me at all times. The app works great.
2011,1,"Gets quickly to 99% and never completes the search. Therefore, no results."
2011,1,"Unable to search for Hotels, tested different cities, but keep receiving ""Oops, search failed, please try again"" error. Force closes on exit also."
2011,1,"I thought this was fixed, but it isn't. This cannot be rated high unless it works."
2011,4,"not bad, but not as many options as the full website. I'll keep going there for the time being."
2011,1,Wont search..stupid app stays on 99% forever... Whats the point id give it less than one star but it wont let me
2011,1,I will keep this app a few days in hopes it'll be fixed. Great UI
2011,4,When you try to press flight track icon the appear crashes. Please fix.
2011,4,This is a handy tool when you are planning trips.  A way to add trips othen than by the website would be nice though.
2011,1,Great program on iPod. Too bad it crashes to the point of uselessness on my Android.
2011,4,Ui is extremely easy to use. Great app overall!
2011,5,Excellent way to check available flights and prices while on the go.  Works great!
2011,4,"Only wish is to enter filtering criteria before a search, instead of waiting for all results to then apply a filter."
2011,5,Save so much time on looking for the best deal out there... thanks kayak
2011,2,"Update contains a lot of bugs...when typing in airport name, the result is hidden underneath a black bar and when searching, it gives me a oops error."
2011,5,I use this on my phone and my laptop.  Kayak has also been very responsive to user suggestions.
2011,4,"This app isn't as feature rich as the website, but it's great for accessing trip data if you use My Trips."
2011,4,Love the automatic notifications. Great for when you need to watch a fare price!!!
2011,1,You would think that an app from a multimillion dollar company would at least function. Travel fail.
2011,4,Works well. No complaints wish it carried jet blue also but that's fine
2011,4,Search options are great. Only issue is that I have trouble when it comes to purchasing.
2011,4,Works as expected. Easy to read. Fast.
2011,5,"Great tool to find options, check alternatives, etc.!"
2011,1,Would probably be a great app if I could see results. Still hangs at 99% on search results on atrix.
2011,1,Updated app and performed search for round trip flight... 99% hang every time.
2011,5,I always find some great deals on hotels and flights. LOVE IT!
2011,1,if people trusted this app it could damage tourist industry as it is showing no hotels available in cities i know that there is plenty. bad app.
2011,1,"No hotels found in Honolulu, Hawaii huh? Ok..."
2011,5,Easy to use. Prices are accurate.  My Droid X likes this app.
2011,2,"Updated kayak sucks, has to force close everytime I search a flight. Older one worked so much better."
2011,5,Great app saves me a lot of time looking for options!
2011,5,It's a very useful app.  I love the car rental option.
2011,1,I have tried several times to get my flight info. It is stuck at 99%.... :(
2011,1,All searches hang at 99%. Useless until fixed. Uninstall.
2011,1,"Boooooooooooooo!, this app must be made by the 1% who steals from the 99%.   Still hangs."
2011,4,I'd a really useful app but the fare tracker updates far too often. I don't need an update every hour.
2011,1,None of the searches I tried returned any results. This app is clearly not ready; it shouldn't have been released.
2011,1,"Search gets stuck at 99%, just like everyone else. Useless app"
2011,5,Its easy to use and nice user interface
2011,4,"Hang.. Still hangs @ 99%   Added---  Had to go manage applications and delete data after install, worked ok after that."
2011,1,"With multi-city searches, it hangs 99% of the time.  It was a waste of mine."
2011,1,Still can't email itinerary to Kayak from this app. It should be a basic function . Im going back to world mate.
2011,5,"Very good, rantastic. Thank you"
2011,2,Hangs at 99% on searching flight. Evo 4G. Will try again when app updated.
2011,1,"This is some nasty search bug, and no, it is not working yet with 4202 evo 4g"
2011,1,It says no results for miami hotels... Are you serious?
2011,5,Works perfect and it's pretty fast. EVO 4G
2011,1,Always stop at 99 so tell it's fixed ill only give it a one. DROIDX
2011,3,"Nice design, although too iPhoneish for my taste. It seems to be giving me very high prices though."
2011,1,It does in fact hang at 99%. Please fix! Looks like a good app otherwise.
2011,1,"Had the same issues as some others, doesn't go past 99%."
2011,1,It will not complete a search. It stops at 99%.
2011,3,...97...98...99.................. Looks like a very good app if it could ever get to 100%.
2011,4,Great app..good for planning. But concerned about data confidentiality....particularly misuse of data
2011,2,Won't finish loading on flight search. Gets to 99% and stops.
2011,2,tried multiple times to search for flights...
2011,3,Stuck on 99% please fix so I can have Kayak on mobile!
2011,1,It still hangs on 99% even though they said its been fixed.
2011,1,Does not work. Reaches ninety nine percent  and just hangs.
2011,1,Great app design but it doesn't find anything and search stops at 99%.
2011,1,"Yep, if you can't find hotels in Chicago, what's the point of this crapware?"
2011,4,Great app...has issues selecting dates once in a while but really good for the most part!
2011,3,Great app.  Could be better though.
2011,1,Samsung epic 4g touch. Hangs at 99% won't budge
2011,5,"Accurate flight checker, not used it yet for booking anything yet, but it appears very good."
2011,1,Couldn't find hotel for any of the cities I tried. Worthless
2011,2,UI and application seems very nice but freezes when search progress hits 99%.
2011,2,Everytime I use it. During search it freezes at 99%. Samsung Vibrant
2011,4,"Great app, a few bugs and sometimes inaccurate but pretty handy"
2011,4,"One of the few apps that deliver the promise without bugs, crashes and glitches!"

2011,3,"Still getting stuck at 99, even though it says it's been fixed in the latest update :-(  Exiting and restarting the app seems to fix the problem."
2011,5,"Fast and accurate, would like to see booking directly through app (path of least resistance) but then Kayak would be purchased, then we pay!"

2011,4,"Its a really wonderful app, works great for me.. added 4 flights, 3 hotels and 2 car bookings, all appeared perfectly.. I had to edit few here and there though..  It provides an option to get directions only to the selected airports, but this option is not enabled for any other places like a hotel (though it displays the location in Google map). If they can provide map of all locations in the itinerary, its a perfect 5!!"
2011,4,"Love the app. Integrates well with my schedules. Keeps me informed with text alerts. Ability to share with others is also useful. I have on occasion, had syncing issues with my desktop and phone. Only happened twice so I knocked it a star but it is still my preferred choice to organize my travel"
2011,5,"I found my flight in the app; coulda booked it too but thought it prudent to do via the airline's website.  But then to add the itinerary to the app, instead of adding each connecting flight for my round trip (6 in total) like in the Pageonce Travel app, I simply had to forward my itinerary email from the airline to kayak and bam, within seconds i got a response email with a link to my kayak page where it was all there.  Checked the android app & bam, all there.  Pushed the Add All button & bam, calendered!"
2011,2,"I was impressed with the interface and how fast the slick progress bar moved while searching flights...  until it stalled at 99%,  repeatedly."
2011,3,"Remove the notification, it is really not needed and useless. And I prefer previous compact widget design, same information in much less wasted space."
2011,4,I love this app for tracking all of my trips and associated info.  There have only been a couple of instances where it did not recognise the itinerary I emailed.  It also has a few trips that have passed that I can't get moved from current to passed
2011,4,Why does it only list iPhone / iPad chargers in the packing list on an Android phone / tablet?? This is an insult ;-) but seriously minus one star...
2011,2,"Every single flight search I do, as soon as the results come up, it force closes on me.  If the app worked on my phone it looks like it would be solid"
2011,2,"Stuck at 99% when finding flights, never worked. Uninstalled. HTC Incredible."
2011,5,"Great to have one spot to search airlines, hotels and rental cars. Nice tools to filter results."
2011,5,"I travel a ton, and Kayak is a fantastic tool.  The seamless availability between my computer and my phone is great.  Needs the iOS version's features"
2011,4,"I use Kayak a lot, so this app was a great addition to my phone. Easy to use; the only thing I would change is how the filtering works."
2011,5,Use this app more than any other travel tool.  it has proved most useful to  me in finding the best room rates.
2011,1,In a perfect world this may be a good app! Kills my network every time I open the app then gives a failure to connect to network crap! HTC Thunderbolt
2011,2,I love the website & it worked on my previous Blackberry but it gives my force close error messages. It won't run past 99% for flights & force closes.
2011,4,Good app overall does what its suppose to. A lil choppy at times FC's occasionally. Updates should fix.
2011,4,Glad to be using Kayak!  Easy to use with a wide range of features and services.
2011,4,Works well and fast on my Samsung Galaxy S ll.  Quick and easy way to search and get a flight and/or hotel.
2019,4,"Good app and website, but the app lacks certain features available on the website. However, still a great source for comparing prices and finding great deals 😊"
2011,5,Most of my flight bookings now happen over my phone using this app. I highly recommend it.
2011,4,"Tried finding flights. It stalls at 99% complete forever.  But when I tried later, it worked ok. Droid2global"
2011,5,"Excellent app.  I travel all over, different airlines to different parts of the country. Kayak makes it easier to find best value, air,hotels and cars"
2011,3,Would rate better as new things are great but widget doesn't work as says every page is full. Fix for a five
2011,4,"It's very useful, but the latest update does not allow you to zoom in on the flight tracker maps."
2011,5,My wife is a flight attendant so without a doubt it allows tracking not just her domestic but international trips as well. It's great!! robweb56
2011,4,"One small but annoying issue: If you click to call a local airline or car rental firm, it often calls a number in another country"
2011,3,Nice app! (Good: exit unloads from memory.  Bad: runs itself--keeps loading into memory--even if you didn't run it!!  So... may uninstall.)
2011,5,Went on vacation last end of year. Used kayak to find best combination to plan flights and save over $900 for 2 to Europe. Excellent!!!
2011,1,Flight search stops at 99%. No results. Android 2.2.1 on stock  MyTouch 4G
2011,5,Works good.....all in one on the go tool for finding hotels and more....sure beats searching for a coupon book while on vacation.....maps and photos
2011,5,"Clear interface, useful features like travel itinerary in one place, a flight tracker and travel data source."
2011,5,"Excelleny UI. Sometimes gets stuck at 99% while searching flights. But, overall nice experience."
2011,4,"Best travel app for android. I lover the ability to find airfare, car rental, and hotel all in one place."
2011,3,I love the setup and options in the app. It would be great if it didn't get stuck at 99 percent!
2011,1,This is a third party vendor that does not have a real time inventory of rooms.  There is no guarantee that the hotel will have your reservation.
2011,5,Very easy to check flights on daily basis. Uses sights I have never heard of before to find a great deal.
2011,1,"When searching, it always gets to 99% and locks up. Wi-fi & network. Please fix."
2011,5,I love the packing list feature because I always forget something on a trip...not anymore with Kayak
2011,5,"Use this all the time on the interweb, and now on my phone. Absurdly easy to use and delivers the goods."
2011,5,Works great on my DROIDX. Gets me the best price.
2011,5,I fly to the West Coast to see family at least once a year. This app works great with finding cheap flights and staying organized.
2011,5,Love the application.   Works great for me when on the road.  Helps organize all trip details.
2011,2,I normally love it. But just did and up date a few hours ago and it sucks now. :-( It keeps closing and having error.
2011,5,"Needs flight improvements, like airport schedules. Better first and business info including seat maps."
2011,5,fast & effective!  found the best deals faster than any other travel  search engine.
2011,2,"Worked great on my incredible! But, flight search won't load past 99% on my thunderbolt! Not sure why!?! Uninstalling....unfortunately"
2011,5,Even allows multiple city search.  Not as much info as the regular site..but for mobile its very easy to use.
2011,4,"Awesome app! Only downfall is when you search for hotels you can't narrow down by amenities (ex: pets allowed, free wi-fi, etc.)"
2011,1,Love the site but this app does not load anything for results. I tried to uninstall and reinstall but it still didn't work on my DROID X.
2011,2,"More airports must be added, also add a dollars/pounds toggle, will rate give stars if they are, none for spanish islands like majorca or lanzarote..."
2011,5,Very easy to use. Nice to see that the app gives you full functionality and has all the search filters like the full website.
2011,5,Convenience on-the-go! Great tool. Thanks!
2011,4,Does an excellent job.  I would give it 5 but I don't like how some hotels you have to go to their site.
2011,4,"At first, Searches hung up at 99%.Bionic.   May have been an an issue with broadband.  Working Now."
2011,4,Fast and effective.... A great app! Cheap flights on the go... In elegance.
2011,1,Useless Failure! No date ranges work on Galaxy Tablet.
2011,5,"That's what I was looking for ..location of hotels,car rentals, flights in multi-destination!  Thanks"
2012,4,Like the app but checking out listing's in map view is a pain.
2011,5,Works like a champ. Love this app. Using Galaxy S.
2011,5,So convenient to have details on my cell anytime I need them. Love the 24-hour advance alerts about the plane's on time schedule.
2011,3,It cool I had it before I liked it. It's not great but it works....
2011,2,Would be great if it actually worked. Latest update constantly force closes on my Droid.
2011,3,It's pretty good if it doesn't keep shutting down. Sometimes it doesn't give correct info on flight status.
2011,4,Works well - easy to use - good comparison of the full web version.
2011,5,The best travel app. It syncs with your calendar. None of the others do this.
2011,5,As a kayak fan this works great. I like the fact that they continue to make this app better with each update.
2011,4,Very good. I just miss more desktop features in the mobile app.
2011,5,I find everything I need and its saved me tons of money. I travel a lot so this app totally helpful!
2011,4,Fast and accurate way to search through airfares on your smartphone. A must have.
2011,4,Easy to use and really helpful search engine.  occasionally crashes during searches. Samsung nexus.
2011,5,Do all of my research here. Easy site to find the perfect deal.
2011,5,"Fast, with a very nice interface!"
2011,5,"This app is awesome, compares several websites for you and let's you see all prices so you can make the best choice for your travel...loove this app!"
2011,5,"Gives you pretty much everything you need when traveling. The website has even more, but the app has some things the website lacks."
2011,4,Makes it so easy! Just 1 site gives me all the info I need.
2011,5,I am never comfortable until my travel itinerary is contained within Kayak.  It keeps me on top of everything I need to know about flight changes.
2011,4,EASY TO USE AND QUITE RELIABLE. GREAT TOOL FOR TRAVEL.
2011,5,One of the most practical apps I have. Highly recommend!
2011,1,keeps stalling at 99% when searching for flights...go to the site.  Droid X
2011,5,Ease of use is similar to the full website (which says a lot because there are many filters) and speed is much better than using the Browser.
2011,5,Please add the 'vacations' option in future versions.
2011,4,"Great app!!! Saved me tons of money, and help me find last minute flights, hotels and car rentals"
2011,1,I love Kayak on my laptop but on droid x every search got hung up at 99%.
2012,5,"I love this app! I  consistantly use it, and have never had any problems with it. Five stars!"
2011,4,Extremely easy to use... Like using app better than the actual site!!
2011,1,Doesn't work on galaxy s2. Gets to 99% and doesn't complete
2011,5,Awesome app! Enables me to find the best rates for flight tickets or even car rentals right at my finger tips.
2011,5,I find the best prices here. Does all the searching for me. Love this app.
2011,4,"Daily alerts very helpful, but +/-function doesn't bring up lowest fares."
2011,1,Searches never get past 99%... galaxy s 2. Useless until fixed
2011,4,"I'm heading to the us soon on exchange, very useful for those flights. No good for flights out of australia though."
2011,5,Travel 200 days a year. What will I do without Kayak. Love this application.
2011,2,When searching for a flight the processing status shoots right up to 99% then holds forever. Super annoying!
2011,5,I love this app! Easy to use and finds me great deals quick!
2011,5,Works great. Nice for tracking flights and finding new ones.
2011,5,This app is great!! The prices are up to date & I love the reminder feature.

2011,5,love this app. It's so easy and convenient to use. I book all my trips on Kayak.
2011,5,app. If you travel substantially whether for work or for play this gets the job done!! Highly recommend!!

2011,5,"Great Interface, precise info! Map is icing on the cake!"

2011,5,"This app helps me with all my travel plans, thanks!"
2011,3,Love the app but it is crashing on my EVO when I try to edit the list of tracked flights..would give 5 stars otherwise
2011,5,I haven't even used this and it asked me to rate it. So don't go off this. I couldn't tell you if this is good or not.
2011,5,Really enjoy using it. Purchased a few tkts & hotel stays through this app. It was easy & painless.
2011,5,I use it all the time to check rates. Easy to use.

2011,5,This app makes it simple to find fares. Love it!

2011,5,Use it f'r all travel related stuff.  Easy to use.  Excellent
2011,4,"It works just like their website, with less features."

2011,5,"I love this app! So convenient and easy to use.  As a frequent traveler, I can't live without it!"
2011,4,Can't get any easier than this. Cuts down my search time on the internet.
2011,1,"Keeps saying no hotels found for Vegas, which is impossible. Please fix."
2011,4,This program is the best ever. But if they can include the local flayt that would be great.
2011,5,Easy to use. Comprehensive results. Great app.
2011,2,I always get stuck at 99% when searching for flights!!  Please fix!

2011,5,"fast and acqurate searching tool, best deals finder"
2011,1,So far not working stuck at 99 percent search for flight price and doesn't show any results
2011,4,Very decent app! I use it to keep checking flight statuses and if prices have changed
2011,4,I wish it included more airlines such as Southwest and other more economical airlines. Other than that great electronic travel agent.
2011,4,"Awesome app, buy flight status causes force close and it won't keep me logged in!"
2011,5,I absolutely adore the ease and reliability of kayak the website and was pleased to find the same in this app. It is the first place I go to look and

2011,3,"The calendar buttons don't work sometimes, but everything else is good"
2011,3,Like this app. One improvement would be to add in cost of luggage.
2011,4,It does almost everything the website does. I only wish the alert result could be listed in the app as well as email.
2011,4,I wish there was an Irish site so i could get more Ryanair flights as results. And in euros.
2011,4,Like it helpful first choice when booking. done send

2011,5,Kayak
2011,5,yay
2011,5,Wow
2011,5,Works well
2011,1,I tried 4 different local cities and this app found nothing!! That's bad when you just arrived in a new place and really need some place to lay your h
2011,5,"Kayak has gone above and beyond with this app. You'll need it for every stage of ur travel. Awesome interface, too!"
2011,1,It can't find the flight when flightTracker has no problem. Date lookup is very limited when using the flight tracking feature for future dates.
2011,4,No problems as described below. Works like it always has. Just installed on new samsung epic 4g.
2011,5,So easy to use and many filter options! You can email your findings to others as well as purchase from the phone. Best flight finder app!
2011,4,"'Ol plan-ahead Shirlums drops into a rare spot..4 cities beamin with rms, rms, rms wantin to pamper her tuckerd out processor? Kayak sad. He try hard."
2011,5,"If you ever have to travel suddenly (family member ill, etc.) you will be glad you installed this App! It works great even over 3G."
2011,4,great interface. did not find Aer Lingus fair that was 100 dollars lower via aer lingus site.
2011,4,"On some occasions I need to press search multiple times for the app to find any flights. Other than this issue, it works exactly as advertised."
2011,5,People who say search doesn't populate results; try turning on gps services.
2011,3,"Searches sometimes switch to the default values halfway through a search, and filters dont always work. Has potential, but not ready for primetime yet"
2011,4,I always find cheap flights last minute.  Only problem I have ever had is finding 2 seats next to each other.
2011,5,I too was coming up with no results from my queries ...so on a whim I uninstalled and reinstalled and now it works great!!!
2011,1,"Useless. Uninstalling. No flights found London to Riga, only error message."
2011,1,Took forever to download and I kept having to re boot the application to get results. I found nothing. Stupid.
2011,5,Fantastic mobile version of one of my favorite websites ever. Good stuff.
2011,2,Keeps saying error or try again. I haven't had ANY success on finding any info I need
2011,2,"Why are my contacts needed for the app to show me rates on flights and hotels, etc.? Explain that."
2011,1,Tried two flight searches. Both failed. Epic 4g touch
2011,1,"What a useless app, every search returned nothing. Don't waste your time with such a crappy service."
2011,1,tried to use but no hotels available in las vegas  this week. Yea right. tens of thousands available on other sites .
2011,1,"Oops, sorry error occured!!! Is as far as this app got me. Very dissapointed."
2011,5,"Great UI, fast results. Love it!"
2011,1,"Worst app useless, can not find a flight from the UK to las Vegas expida found it straight away"
2011,5,Best price finding app. Love it.
2011,5,Works well...a lot of options
2011,3,Doesn't allow you to search flexible dates.. dumb.
2011,2,The website shows different prices...I don't think the app is working correctly
2011,1,"Does not work.. ""nothing found"" in every search"
2011,1,Zero hotels found for every search in any and every city.
2011,1,"Really, ads before playing a single song.  I wish I could rate it 0 stars."
2011,1,This application is really incredible: nothing works.
2011,5,Was working fine until now. I can't select a return date when I search for flights.
2011,5,Easy searching keeps me using it again and again. A must have for a traveler.

2011,5,Must have application for business travellers
2011,5,Как каяк
2011,5,Had Trip Advisor on my phone and did a like for like comparison on flights and same hotel. This came in far cheaper or both counts especially on the hotel. Also Trip advisor will insist on turning on your gps even if you just want to look up flights. I am just using this now.
2011,3,It used to show small flights and now it's only showing big commercial liners... And their price ranges start at $740. I'm not using this anymore.
2011,1,"used kayak to try to find decent hotel rates in anchorage, ak. Tells me there are no hotels. epic fail kayak."
2011,5,"Best app I have ever seen on Android or iOS. Very usable , helpful, elegant, feature rich. Can't complaint. Must have."
2011,1,"Oops, a Problem Occured - Please Try Again? Search is not only broken, it continually freaks out and I can't seem to kill the program."
2011,1,Sent email to kayak regarding need for WAY too much information and pretty much privacy invasion...never heard back. Will be uninstalling very soon.
2011,1,"Every time i find a great air fare and gp to book it, the airline tells me the query is 15 old and no longer valid. Junk"
2011,1,Looks cool but doesn't work. I too got the error msgs and app froze. Useless. Droid Charge.
2011,3,"Will not update for my Droid. App only shows ""OPEN"" and ""UNINSTALL "" buttons for supposed update."
2011,1,Kayak says flight is on time. Yah. It's already an hour late. Can't trust the results. Fail!!!!
2011,2,Great design. But could not locate any hotels close.
2011,5,"Vastly improved, really like this app now, used it a bit while travelling Europe. Can't add new items to packing lists"
2011,1,There were no search results found no matter what was put in the query and and error message. UNINSTALL NOW.
2011,1,"According to my recent searches using this app, there are no hotels in Edinburgh, nor flights to get there. The same applies to Rome and Barcelona."

2011,5,Nice app now supports tablets. Thanks....
2011,1,"""Oops! No hotels found in your area!"" No hotels in Orlando or San Francisco open in two weeks? BS!!!"
2011,1,Contact data?! What in the world do you think this is? The only person im giving my contact data to is your mom.. Uninstalled
2011,1,It reports zero available rooms even when I know from other sites that there are lots. Does not work at all.
2011,5,Nice layout and easy navigation. Great app
2011,5,Fast too. Droid 2
2011,1,Horrible. Doesn't work. DROID x2
2011,1,0 hotels found at every city. What good is this if you can't get a hotel.
2011,1,Every hotel I sward no matter if it was 1 day or 4 days.... Apparently no hotels had anything.
2011,2,Needs work. Got more bugs than a 30 year old mattress
2011,1,I keep trying to search but it says there are no hotels to be found in charleston south carolina?
2011,3,great app and convenient but very sluggish for an app that isn't media rich - htc sensation
2011,4,I like the way the app filters hotels. Please add a distance filter.
2011,2,Kayak didn't show lower cost airfares that both Onthefly and TripAdvisor displayed.
2011,1,0 hotels come up for every search. HTC EVO
2011,1,"Says ""oops, error occurred..."" can't close, EVO 4G."
2011,5,"This app is great and easy to use. It's quick and organized, leaps ahead of the horrid orbitz app."
2011,1,"All I got was ""oops, an error has occurred..."". Uninstalled."
2011,1,Wouldn't ever find any results for hotels no matter what I entered. Uninstall
2011,4,It would be great to see the arrival time displayed on the flight tracker widget.

2011,5,Aaa
2011,1,"latest update stripped all data, history, program will not even recognize my home airport. Closest recomended over 2000 miles away. Pls advise asap."
2011,1,Does not work and by other users devs have abandoned this application! Will change review if the dev pulls head out of a$$!
2011,3,"I love it. Its a great search engine, but everytime go to Book Now and it takes me to the browser i t says flight no longer available. Pls fix"
2011,3,"Love all the features included in app, however when I search for hotels or flights, it get to 25% and says oops failed. Android 2.2.2 DROID x2"
2011,4,Hotel map can't zoom in out or move. It's a bit useless in checking location within a city. HTC Desire HD.
2011,3,"Some parts work well, like flight search. Other parts, like Flight Tracker need work. It also needs vacation search like the website."
2011,5,Best travel app by far. Not as good as the actual site but close. Very user friendly.
2011,1,"Looked in three California cities and each showed no hotels, while we found over 30 in each location using Google. Looks nice, wish it worked."
2011,1,Continues to force close and give erroneous messages regarding previous searches despite update. Will uninstall.
2011,4,Was working great but now its not...past deleted flights keep coming back when I'm searching incoming flight. Program opens by itself
2011,3,Something is not right. Every search returns 0 results for cities I know have to have at least 1 hotel with a room available 3 weeks out
2011,2,Slow. Had to book a last minute flight and this gave expensive results. I went online and found much cheaper. That's pointless.
2011,1,"No Results are ever found! Un-installing. Used to work great, better luck with the actual website."
2011,1,No results found for anywhere in Twin Cities metro? Garbage. I wish I could vote zero stars.
2011,1,Does not work from India. The app knew i am India. It gave no results for hotels or flights to london.
2011,1,"Fairsearch is a bunch of bull****, don't try and blast google cause you don't like that their business plans makes you obsolete"
2011,1,I have an SPRINT EVO 4 G and it is racking havoc with the 4G and other systems on the phone; Uninstalling App. Michelangelo
2011,1,"As big as Oklahoma City is there are no hotels there, according to this app. Will uninstalling this misinformed app."
2011,2,Loved first apparently but this new one is clunky and just plain hard to use. What a shame!
2011,1,"Great app, but needed permissions suck. Concentrate ob what you need!"
2011,1,Closest aiport 500 miles away... constantly shuts off. Unistalling
2011,5,Much improved for devices with larger screens. Thanks!
2011,1,Does not work. Says no hotels found for any city I search.
2011,1,"Update seems to have ruined it, my flight doesn't excist anymore apparently"
2011,5,excellent app... very quick and simple.. DROID x
2011,1,Doesnt work on my samsung exhibit 4g phone
2011,4,I would have given 5 stars if the app would let you book flight and hotel together like the website
2011,5,"Maybe the very best app of them all,and not just talking about travel apps. Beautiful, simple, intuitive, incredibly useful."
2011,1,Crashed my DROID when installed and does not work.
2011,1,No hotels exist anywhere in 2012. What does kayak know?
2011,1,Won't find any hotels anywhere. Rooted Evo unistalled.
2011,5,I really like the app I use it more than I do on my computer.
2011,5,Excellent app. Galaxy s

2011,5,Fabulous. As good as orbitz's is bad.
2011,0,Can some1 explain what this is all about?
2011,1,Doesn't find any results. Installing.

2011,5,Very good and good info
2011,1,"No hotels in Vegas, really?"
2011,1,Can't Find Hotel's
2011,0,Keeps force closing!!
2011,1,Broken app
2011,5,Niceee
2011,1,Nothing is ever found
2011,3,Dont like that they added an ad bar. It takes up a whole row that could display an additional result. This app didnt have ads in earlier version.
2011,1,"I get ""Oops! Update failed. Please try again"" when I try to add a flight to track. Boo! (Motorola Atrix)"
2011,3,"A great app for searching for best airfares. BUT, why does it need all these intrusive permissions? I will not be installing the update"
2011,2,Doesn't discover carrier e-deals or online saver prices. So no point in using Kayak if you're after cheapest flights.
2011,2,Don't think it works with Ryanair. Can't search any arrivals or departures for their flight & we fly often with them. No weather forecasts. Uninstall.
2011,2,Widget did't work correctly wnen i am in another time zone. And... Why app can't post my flights to my google calendar?
2011,3,"3* because it occasionally crashes, the file size is 6mb+ when on phone memory, and then the widget doesn't work when it's on SD. Top app otherwise!"
2011,4,Has gotten much better however it is not listed in my available widgets. Please fix to get 5 star.
2011,5,"Works as good as the regular site! Useful for checking flight prices, havent used auto alerts yet."
2011,3,Not sure if everything was correct but I don't need it for my trip so I'm unnstalling. Great app though easy to use and nice
2011,1,Huge--5 MB in internal memory after moving to SD card. Force closes. *Why do they need to read our contact data? Uninstalling.*
2011,5,"Great app but new upgrade wants way too many permissions which it doesn't need. Send emails to my contacts, really? No upgrade for me."
2011,5,Love that I can flex search before and after my date 3 days. Makes it easy to find great deals
2011,1,Convenient to check prices. Force closed. Price alert widget only updates when you create the alert.
2011,4,Very nice. Easy to use. Fast and as full of features as the website. N1.
2011,1,Why do u need so much privat access? Plus remove else will uninstall. Thanks
2011,2,What's with needing such intrusive permissions? Why does it need access to contacts and the ability to send email? 4 stars otherwise.
2011,1,Widget does no updates. Missed to book a flight. Galaxy S II.
2011,1,New update sucks. Plus all the new intrusive permissions... uninstall immediately! EVO
2011,1,Doesn't do anything. No flights in the U.S. all summer long. Weird I guess I have to drive.
2011,1,"Widget never updates price, even if the time updates. Can never find the price it claims to have either."
2011,5,"Been using this app for over a year now, and it's great, these last few days however it's not retaining my trip info. Please fix PLEASE!"
2011,1,Useless app prices were cheaper online on air carrier site vs searching on kayak. Better off shopping around myself
2011,2,"It says 0 hotels found....in Virginia beach, in myrtle beach, in my hometown. I know there are hotels. HTC thunderbolt"
2011,2,They dropped jetBlue from their search. Add them back!
2011,4,There seems to be a difference with the webbased version as I'm getting different results. Otherwise great app
2011,2,Information is just downright wrong or way too delayed half the time. Compare w flight tracker & u will see.
2011,1,"Good for finding flights, worthless if you need to actually book it from your mobile device... Flights are always ""unavailable"" for booking..."
2011,1,HTC Hero: Nice interface but no US flights available. What's with that?
2011,1,Always tells me there are no flights when I search. Please fix asap!
2011,4,Great app. Doesnt drain the battery
2011,1,Results it gives are crazy. Belfast to krakow takes 13hrs and costs £1396? Lmao!
2011,1,Doesn't show accurate prices and can't go to website and redeem price on app ...ever
2011,4,Does not save flight tracking information. My trips itinerary is not parsed to flight tracking section I have to enter flight details everytime I run
2011,1,I can't allow you to read my contact data and to send emails!
2011,2,Seems very usa centric. Not many options for india
2011,1,Uninstalling until they revert this ridiculous update that wants to read my contact data.
2011,1,Stupid bigoted comments from your CEO/CMO.
2011,3,Useful but force closes all the time on droid x
2011,1,Send emails to my contacts? No way. Not upgrading.
2011,1,Why do u need personal info and especially my contact info. No way!
2011,3,Buggy on thunderbolt - flex days option crashes.
2011,1,Privacy issues are the reason for one star.... Uninstall!
2011,5,"Worked great for me, alot better than Orbitz."
2011,4,"Want to use custom airport search, I.e. yyz, buf,Iag. Please changelog"
2011,4,A tab to search vacation packages would be nice
2011,4,Makes life a little easier to search flights
2011,4,I wish it supported flexible date searches.
2011,1,"Apparently there aren't any hotels in tampa, fl."
2011,5,Great app. Offers everything I could do on the website.
2011,5,Easier and morethan quick than Expedia on my laptop
2011,0,Ever since the update it force closes when looking up flights!
2011,1,Does no work on Xoom.
2011,1,Won't work on thunderbolt.
2011,1,"""No flights found"" unexplained error."
2011,3,Cool app and widget.
2011,5,so far best mobile app travel app
2011,1,Keeps getting force close....that is wigging me out....
2011,1,Not as good as Skyscanner.
2011,1,Crashed my Droid X.
2011,5,Morons don't use Kayak
2011,4,Useful App.
2011,5,Nice and great app.
2011,1,Ridiculous permissions...uninstalled
2011,1,Oops. A problem occurred.
2011,5,Nice appl allows filtering...
2011,5,So handy for researching international flights
2011,1,Why do you need all these permissions?!
2011,3,my trips randomly become blank
2011,4,Decent
2011,5,First class
2011,0,Can't add widget
2011,1,No way because of permissions
2011,1,Utter sh1te
2011,1,CRAP

2011,4,Fast and accessible. New UI is very user friendly. Desire z.
2011,3,It's a good app. but just installed update and all my trips are gone.
2011,1,Piece of crap. Don't waist time! Found no hotels in my searches.
2011,2,Very easy to use but pointless since it shows no flights available even though I KNOW there is availability
2011,3,Keeps asking for my login even checkbox to save is enabled. Annoying
2011,5,Re rated back to 5 stars for adding change log back. Good job!
2011,1,Useless! Couldn't find flights I know exist.
2011,1,Tried 5 times to find flight didnt find any FAIL

2011,1,I use the web version all the time for travel bookings. This app simply doesn't work. I never get any results no matter what I search for.
2011,5,Update! Bug fixed. Love this.Nice app but has bugs on mt4g. Says 'My Trips' are hidden but they're not. Works fine on PC but has problems on phone.
2011,2,Flight tracker widget does not sync well with main app. Flight updates are too slow / widget displays old flight info even after old trip is deleted.
2014,1,The calendar is not working correctly. I am using Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The return date keeps going haywire.
2011,5,"Outstanding app! I had a trip of 3 cities in 4 days with air, car & hotel. This kept everything organized, including alerts on flight status etc."
2011,3,"Good features, but missed a U.S. Airways flight cancellation, still shows the cancelled flight as on time. Good thing I had FlightView Free."
2011,5,"This is so cool and addictive, i keep searching for good deals using this app, just awesome, you will not like web version after using this."
2011,5,"My only complaint is that it doesn't have the ""Packaging List"" feature that's on the IOS version. Anyways, I love this app."
2011,4,Thank you for change log! New UI is much better! G2
2011,2,The description says that we cam view and update trip itinerary. How? Can't find the option to view my trips even after recent update.
2011,3,"It truly lives up to its slogan, you can really ""seach one then done."" ^_^ -HTC EvO Babe"
2011,2,"Slow,scroll window is tiny and hard use. Go to the online version, faster and easier"
2011,5,"Works grat, just like the website. Love the widget too!"
2011,1,Says no results when searching for flights but easily found them on desktop. Ex: lax to pit June 7 to June 13
2011,5,"Great App! Installs to SD Card, save your much needed main memory! Bravo! 5-Stars"
2011,2,Worked great on my g2 but Motorola xoom it won't even let me install. Not kosher.
2011,5,Used it during my trip to San Francisco. Book my flight and hotel with no problem. Even tell me where my baggage was
2011,4,"Other than the obvious lack of change log, a solid app. Needs flexible date function to get 5 stars"
2011,1,Doesn't get accurate results. Redirect to other sites that say trip unavailable
2011,1,"Would not find flights at all. Said oops, error occurred"
2011,1,App returns no results then can't be restarted. Pointless waste.
2011,1,Search flights on laptop and they appear but this app says no flights available. Not good app
2011,1,"Search always fails, never finds any results."
2011,2,"Nice UI, but flight search kept giving error toast, in wifi/3g"
2011,3,"I love Kayak on the regular internet, so this app is really handy."
2011,1,"Says no hotels found in Cleveland, OH. Uninstalling."
2011,1,"Never works. Always get ""oops"""
2011,5,All issues that I'm aware of have been fixed. I use it all the time.
2011,3,"Shows low price for flights in the app search screen, but when trying to buy takes you to a website with a higher ticket price."
2011,5,"Add fare alert malfunctions, along with repeat force closing. Really wish they would fix the bugs in this app."
2011,4,Nice app. Really helpful when trip planning!
2011,1,won't update. won't uninstall. samsung fascinate.
2011,4,Works fine. EVO
2011,1,Says flights cannot be found when airline websites say they exist. Uninstalling.

2011,1,"This app works well on my iPhone, but the sames searches on my Android device return the ""No flights found"" message. Same happens for friend too."
2011,5,Unbelievably convenient! Keeps me completely up tip date for best prices for all travel and even keeps my itineraries organized. Galaxy s
2011,5,Pretty feature-packed for a phone version of Kayak. Love My Trips feature and ability to build itineraries from forwarded travel emails. HTC Glacier
2011,3,"Seems like a great app, but there must be something wrong with the server right now. It says that it can't find any flights. Hopefully its fixed soon"
2011,2,Flight status doesnt update at all!!! Caused me to be an hour early toa delayed flight!...fix please. SAMSUNG EPIC

2011,1,Force closed twice on initial opening of app. Also didn't function well when trying to enter to and from cities. Uninstall.
2011,2,"Motorola Citrus- does what it claims, but randomly freezes while being used. Have to force close when that happens."
2011,1,I never update an app that doesn't post recent changes highlights. Very unprofessional.
2011,1,Only good for US searches. Gave me nothing for canadian flight searches. Uninstall.
2011,3,It's a good app but does not have the ability to search for flight and hotel packages. You can only search separately.

2011,1,Search failed no flights found. Edinburgh to London. WTF
2011,1,Very slow startup time. Couldn't find any flights from London to San Francisco.

2011,5,Unlike a lot of apps this is just as good as the desktop version. Droidx
2011,1,No flight found. Doesn't work in London. Avoid
2011,1,Rubbish- in uk at least. Can't find scheduled flights. Uninstalled.

2011,1,"Simply doesn't work for me. No flights from london to orlando in september, apparently! Galaxy s / froyo"
2011,1,It looks like they tried to fix the fare alerts to display on the widget and now any search results in a force close. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION!

2011,4,U guys are so stupid. One star because they forgot a changelog this time??? Just don't update it. And by the way the description says iphone.
2011,3,It wont let me book hotels! It always tells me the results have expired. I like Kayak but this Android app sux.
2010,4,Widget is a huge drain on battery. Dont use unless you have unlimited data. Otherwise great app!
2011,3,"Average: good airport data, good rental car finder, rather clumsy flight interface, so-so results. Absolutely no comp to ITA."
2010,3,I love Kayak and it's handy but tends to force close. Flexible dates are possible but hard to find the option. Samsung fascinate.
2011,4,Great app! 5 stars when you allow me to delete trips. My travel changes frequently and I can't remove completed or outdated info.
2011,3,"Obnoxious interface, and can't book hotels directly from the app. Maybe someone will find use with this app, but not me."
2011,1,No hotels found as I'm currently in the hotel room? Maybe just a glitch but I don't have the time to figure it out. Uninstalled.
2011,1,I don't like this app at all it does not let you add flight let's even though it says you can. Plus it keeps force closing all my other app.#fail

2011,2,Okay when it works. The last month or so it has force closed every time I use it. Uninstalled. Droid X
2011,4,Can't add alerts to widget. Very irritating. Otherwise its a 5 star... droid x
2011,3,"Good app, but the widget won't work. Can't add flights to track prices for on the app, but the website is great."
2010,1,Put in Jul 2011 dates and found no flights. Changed to flexible +- 2 days and found lots of flights but in Feb. Just didn't work.
2010,1,"You piece of crap, can't even show flight is diverted and severely delayed! Cost me a small fortune and 8 hour of my life on a pointless journey!"
2010,1,"If everything is updated as well as ""status"",then this app is completely useless. 5 hours after the plane lands it has still not updated status."
2011,1,Optimized for the iPhone? No changelog so you don't even know if they fixed any one of the many bugs in their app.
2011,2,logs me in but searches fail repeatedly. Not much use eh.. Htc desire 2.2 orange uk.
2011,3,Great search options. Always shows the cheapest price. But the FLIGHT TRACKER SUCKS! SOOOO UNRELIABLE!!!
2011,5,Tried this out a while ago and wasn't getting any search results back. Reinstalled and now seems to work great. D-Inc. Froyo 2.2

2010,4,"Its great,but doesnt let me see flights under $400.. Looked in my pc & found a cheaper flight ..lower than $400"
2011,5,Was having the same FC issues as everyone else. Installed and reinstalled - now works great again.
2010,2,Dates are screwed up. I search for flights for January 5th and it converts the search to May 1st. This is using the calendar widget.
2010,4,Calendar integration doesn't adjust for time zone changes on flights. Simple oversight
2011,1,So disappointed. Forces close every time when typing city for flight search. HTC incredible. Uninstalled.
2010,2,Force closes. Widget still doesn't work. No way to add alerts.
2011,1,I'm uninstalling. I can get better deals on priceline. Cricket M680
2010,5,Works very good. Keeps polishing with updates! Recommend. A

2011,1,"Not worth downloading, crashed multiple times and wouldn't show any flights although 300 available. Driod x"
2010,3,Doesn't give hotel prices or availability on search page. If there are no rooms available don't show it to me.

2011,1,Horrible. Not even accurate pricing. Seems like it only keeps track of delta flights and two others.

2011,1,"Was working but now shows no flights on search results, keeps asking to touch screen to view all, but then shows no flights."
2010,2,Force closes WAAAAAY too many times. Uninstalled until this is taken care of. Droid X.
2011,1,Feels like less than a beta. Search page comes accross as not very thought through and very search failed
2011,1,Crappy. Waste of time. Did not find any flight including those I know that exist.
2011,2,"Have used successfully on my bb storm, but does not accept arrival, destination airports, therefore unusable Howard"
2011,5,This is an awesome app! I planned 4 of my business trips just by using this app on my phone.
2011,1,"Search for hotels in London gives ""search failed"" and 0 results. No use to me..."
2011,1,Force closes. Doesn't recognize certain popular destinations. Uninstall.
2011,1,It wont pick up the airport i want to search. Which is in a major city! No bueno.
2010,1,trips no longer working after update. completely useless now

2010,3,"FC when searching for city by name, works OK if you know airport code, no need for popup"

2011,1,"Pretty useless, can't find a single flight from London to Ireland in July!"
2011,4,It got an error message the first time i tried to search for a hotel and car. I tried again and it worked great!
2011,3,No fare alert on widget???! This is an outrage!! TMo G2
2011,2,Frequently force closed when entering airport codes. Easier to just use their mobile website.
2011,3,"Every time I try to use the multiple city function, it keeps freezing up."
2011,4,Little slow and I can't do flexible date search. I'd rather use the website.
2011,1,Force closes. No results for Costa Rica or Nicaragua?! Uninstalled
2011,2,The button to add alerts isnt present and the ability to search isn't as robust as on the web. Meh
2010,1,"Opodo flight links are incorrect, they do not match the kayak selected search"
2011,1,For some reason it couldnt even find a hotel in las vegas! How dumb is that!
2011,3,Solid app but refuse to update do to app wanting too many perms.
2011,4,No change log? Optimized for your iphone? lol
2010,1,The Orbitz app. is 10 times better in finding cheaper prices!!!

2010,5,"Well done on the update. Very user friendly, use it for all my trip planning and organization."
2010,1,"Every time I try to use this app, there is a ""problem connecting to the network"". Therefore, I can't use it."
2010,2,"Useful, but not user friendly, and force quit. Galaxy s."
2010,1,This app is worthless. Forces closed every single time. Droid x. Uninstalled
2010,4,Good app! Prices could be a little better. App easy to navigate.
2010,5,This app is the greatest. Cheap tickets. This app saved me not only time but money.
2010,3,"If I could afford to only fly on the big airlines, I probably wouldn't be using this app...add the value airlines!"
2010,1,"The app itself is ok but the search engine is terrible, at least 10 percent more expensive than practically anything else"
2010,1,Could nite find a cheap flight if it fell over one so not worth install.
2010,1,Could not search airports by state. Crashed several times samsung captivate
2010,1,Must also confirm te FC's on my Droid. Running Froyo.
2010,1,"Use to work great, now it won't pull up any flights!!! Nexus One"
2010,3,Good app. Would be better if I could book hotels from the app itself.
2012,4,Lost the My Trips function in the new version... Weak...
2010,4,"Flight information is accurate and informative, would give 5 but haven't tried booking yet"
2010,2,Doesn't allow you to select a specific return flight.
2010,3,It force closed the first time and after it worked just fine.
2010,1,Always starts in Boston and the flight can be more than 100 dollars than travelocity's website not worth it!
2010,4,"Nice, but can't get flex dates to work."
2010,1,Crashes sometimes on milestone with telus fast and lite.
2010,2,Fare alert doesn't work on captivate
2010,5,Excellent app. It has everything related to travel
2010,1,Force close constantly. Terrible on the Droid
2010,3,Keeps force closing on my Galaxy Tab :(

2010,1,Can't find any flights. HTC Eris
2010,1,Force Close (brand new facinate )

2010,5,App rocks.
2010,2,meh
2010,1,"Of all of the apps I use on my Incredible, this is the worst for force closes. Just tried to enter a flight search from/to and it bombs every time."
2010,3,"Interface is getting better, but still not as smooth as the iOS version."
2010,1,Doesn't find budget flights. No results for smaller airports. Stupid.
2010,2,Widget rarely has a price listed. Usually says N/A.
2010,3,"Slow application, and ads take most of screen space in landscape mode. Still useful though."
2010,4,"Good stuff, except the To: in Best Fares gives you the same local airports as the From. (NYC/G2)"
2010,5,Intuitive and useful! Works great Galaxy S.
2010,2,"Great app, but still too many bugs, slow response and many force closes"
2010,1,"Tried to track my flight and it forced closed every two seconds,uninstall...."
2010,1,App never found any flights. Waste of time.
2010,1,Not able to find flights or hotels. Deleting this app.

2010,3,Orbitz works better
2010,5,Works great on DX.
2010,5,Excellent after the latest update.
2010,5,Better than Orbitz
2010,2,I don't like this layout
2010,1,Way too slow
2010,2,Clumsy ui
2010,4,What happened to fare alerts?
2010,2,Not the cheapest.
2010,3,"Version 2.0 is a mistake. List icons too small. Flight status info too big, if I want monitor multiple flights, it is hard to identify the correct one"
2010,1,"Keeps saying no results, and I know there should be because I see it on the computer. Just would be nice to use my phone. Sucks"
2010,3,"It works. But the old one is better, faster, and allow more things (nearby airport, +/- 3 days instead of 1 only). Why take away the nice features???"
2010,2,"Mytouch3g - near as I can tell the widget doesn't work. All I ever get is ""NA+"" for fare alerts."
2010,3,New UI is great. But crashing all the time after the recent upgrade Widget does not work.
2010,1,Yields no search results. Searched common cities for two weeks out and no results yielded. Searched on my computer and worked. Not helpful. Uninstalld
2010,2,Good idea works horrably constant oops msg or wont find anything. Uninstaled - Moment
2010,1,"Constantly restarts itself in background, even when I'm not using ap. Draining battery unnecessarily."
2010,1,"No results. Something broken with the app. Too bad, I love kayak. Please fix!"
2010,2,Unstable and alerts just don't work. Very laggy on a very fast phone.
2010,2,I'm not a fan of the new interface. I liked the tiles more than this list.
2010,4,Works fine. Wish that individual pieces could be installed separately.
2010,1,Absolutely a waste of time.tried a simple search for a flight from LHR to NYC over numerous dates and it returned no flights. Now uninstalling.
2010,5,Super search after update to version 2. 0. Using HTC tattoo
2010,1,Don't waste your time. Doesn't work on HTC evo. Uninstalled.
2010,4,"I love this app! Only downside is it doesn't always find the cheapest thing, but most times it does!"
2010,2,"Super slow after the update, bring back the old version."
2010,1,Listen to the feedback and bring back the old ui. Filters do not do anything.
2010,1,No flights found. Don't waste your time. Uninstalled.
2010,4,Worked well with no problems on HTC evo 2.2. Very good app.No problems looking for Southwest.
2010,4,separate searches from trip planning and flight tracking. it is currently too crowded on front page
2010,1,"Awful, the app couldn't find any flights. Desire 2.2"
2010,5,Very nice app. Works good with EVO
2010,5,So far so good. A lot of neat features
2010,2,SOUTHWEST AIRLINES IS CHEAPER! It doesnt even show it on this app. BUNK! Uninstall.
2010,1,Constantly receive error message that no results can be found and to try again.
2010,5,Works great! Easy to use.
2010,1,Used it to find and reserve a hotel room only to find when i get there i have no reservations! -cliq
2010,3,Why does the widget always only show NA+ instead of the lowest price from the search results?
2011,5,"This app is all you need for travel search, you get all in one place."
2010,1,"Doesn't work. No flights, no hotels"
2010,1,Force closed on my sprint epic...nice idea though...
2010,5,Works well. Easy and informative.
2010,5,Excellent app. Searches airline and hotels fast and easy
2010,5,Great way to quickly get the cost to fly somewhere.
2010,4,Great to have App2SD. Great app too.
2010,1,Kept getting error message definate removal
2010,1,Ran a couple of searches returning nothing. Is it a US only service?
2010,1,For flight you have to stay a month? Weak
2010,1,Never returned any results Android 2.2
2010,5,Very useful!
2010,5,Like this! Very helpfull
2010,5,Works nicely on my Dell Streak
2010,4,Finally has Facebook login!
2010,1,Very limited service.no international flights

2010,5,great app
2010,5,Great app
2010,1,Never result back.UN installed
2010,4,Works on my legend
2010,4,"Cant book sameday, therefore pretty useless... why use the gimped phone app unless you are on the road & need to book same day? W E A K."
2010,3,"Well designed app with a nice homescreen widget too. But it lost stars b/c when tracking a flight it showed ""ontime"" when it was really delayed."
2010,2,got an error within 2 min after opening. exit option didn't exit. better options available. Evo
2010,5,Love this thing! Fast. I think it's easier than Kayak online and it has lots of sorting options. Great app.
2010,1,"Doesn't find any flights, pretty key flaw in a flight finding app. Shame as the layout looked promising."
2010,2,The fact that it auto-rotates even when u have that off is nausiating. 2 stars because content is amazing. Fix the rotate and get five stars.
2010,1,What a huge disappointment! The flight status function doesn't work for my phone. This app needs work.
2010,1,"Terrible, big and way slow. And couldn't even find a flight. Super lame"
2010,1,I cant deal with it. soooo slow. No result. Uninstalling now.
2010,3,Love the function. but it runs battery down when phone is sleeping.
2010,4,Sooooo slow on my droid! Depart and return days are always the same. Crashes!
2010,3,Too big and slow for what it actually does. Good to use on the go.
2010,4,"Nice, but service runs constantly even when not needed. Uninstalled."
2010,3,So slow. Also would like to be able to set multiple flights as widgets.
2010,3,I get better rates when I search on my laptop seconds after I try the same search on my phone.
2010,1,So... no flights from London to New York? At all? Or just a lame app?
2010,1,Doesn't seem to work - can't find any flights
2010,5,Quick and easy way to find the cheapest flights!
2010,1,Since the update can't see results
2010,2,Flight tracking unreliable. Resource hog.
2010,5,"No results on my g1. Plenty of results through the mobile or real website, though..."
2010,5,"User friendly, nice app."
2010,3,Until it has app2sd it's uninstalled. No space for it.
2010,2,"All search results are ""No flights found"""
2010,3,Still no app2SD! Removing again
2010,4,Very good to search
2010,5,Love it! Great app!

2010,5,Works great
2010,1,Force quits
2010,3,"Meh, on Droid Eris"
2010,2,No prices!
2010,1,Captivate. Very slow and bulky. Widget doesn't update. The mobile website is much much faster.
2010,3,Useful but way too big. Needs move to sd card option.
2010,4,"Widget and alerts are great, but the app is not small, with no SD option"
2010,1,It freezez at the main screen. Cant even select anything just freezes. Cliq.
2010,5,"The app will force close occasionally, but its not a problem at all. I love this app! Evo 4g."
2010,5,Gotta love Kayak! Works great on Droid 1.
2010,1,"Great if I need a hotel tonight in Boston, or to fly Boston to SFO. Useless otherwise. Will not show other flights."
2010,3,It wont go further then 1yr for future planning but other then that it does what I need
2010,4,Havnt used it to much but so far im pretty happy with it
2010,1,It has never worked for me -HTC Legend.
2010,3,"Nice, but requests too many permissions"
2010,5,This is a great app! Those who say otherwise are dumbasses...
2010,5,Works well. No complaints.
2010,5,I work for an airline and when ever passangers ask for cheap tix i refer them to kayak
2010,5,Great for trip planning while you're on the go
2010,2,Doesn't do multiple destinations or search for hostels.
2010,4,Much better !!!
2010,5,This app aint no joke
2010,5,Great app
2010,4,Like that Desire
2010,2,Used to work ok although kind of slow. Now force close every time I try selecting a date on flight search. Galaxy spica android 1.5
2011,4,"What happened to ""search nearby airports"" and ""search flexible travel days"" options? Lost them with last update. Please add, they are essential! EVO"
2010,5,The best app. I mean the best. Every one should have it. I love it. Thanks Kayak.
2010,5,Just tested the new update(2.2)for few min with no issues .EVO 4G android 2.2
2010,1,Forced closed everytime i did anything was never able to make even 1 search
2010,3,It's fine as long as you're not relying on widget.
2010,1,Force closes on hero. Can't use calendar.
2010,3,App is great. Widget is a joke
2010,5,"I have used this app 3x now and no issues, works great!"
2010,1,Awful cudnt find hotels or flights please remove this turd
2010,1,Sh#% program doenst work... droid

2010,1,Fc on HTC droid..pls fix
2010,5,Great application!
2010,5,Awesome. Easy to use.
2010,5,Force closes on hero
2010,2,Almost useless as a hotel search app without the ability to do more filtering. Can't even find hotels near an address... only city. Widget needs work.
2010,1,"Useless. Freezes before search is completed - Every. Time. I have tried and tried...alas, uninstalled. Frustrating since the apple app works so well."
2010,5,Great! Planning my trip to Greece. Just wished it had an option to choose the layovers times so I can spend some time in Rome on my way back...
2010,4,I found some great prices on flights to nyc. It forecloses sometimes. Right now I'm afraid to update
2010,5,Works great on my galaxy 3...easy...but it always shows as 4 seats remaining whenever i go to flight info...overall its good...
2010,3,"Works great on my HTC evo, except adding trips to my calendar. It says it can't find my calendar"
2010,5,Great app. Can email trip info to it and it updates itself. So easy.
2010,1,"On the hero, it takes a few seconds to open anything, and info fetching doesn't work most of the time. Halfass port from iphone"
2010,3,"Developer, isn't about time to fix the widget? How much customer input can one ignore?"
2010,5,Great app and the fastest way to search for airfare from your phone. EVO 2.2
2010,2,Nice app. Fast also. It freezes alot on my Driod
2010,1,No hotel rates. They all say call. Only search cities with airports.
2010,3,The search shows the right price but the widget shows a much higher price ! Confusing. Add widget settings?
2011,4,Great app. Would give 5 stars if currency converter yhave all currencies and the app is ad free.
2010,2,"Widget is totally useless, and never gave the correct price in two months of use!"
2010,4,"Great app. Occasionally force closes, but is overall incredible"
2011,4,Has really evolved quite nicely. Great application!
2010,2,Prices are crazy high when compared to doing a normal search on my pc. What gives!?
2010,4,We have used this program to start our search for a vacation! Htc incredible
2010,3,Good for quick searches but the website gives more and better results
2010,4,"Do not include in search result cheap airlines, even such big like Ryanair."
2010,5,Incredibly valuable sitting in the middle of no where in a terrible rain storm with a dog. Saves me time and headache.
2010,2,It keeps freezing when i use the widget fare alert
2010,3,"Great app, but I hate kayaking."
2010,5,Easy to use and does its it well.
2010,5,Always able to find the lowest prices!
2010,5,"If I could have only one app on my phone, it would be this one."
2010,3,Force closes often for me on froyo.
2010,4,Great for searching for flights
2010,4,Pretty Good App
2010,4,Needs mutli city search option for flights
2010,1,Force close everytime I opened. Uninstalled.
2010,5,Fast way to get flight info
2010,1,Claims to search Southwest. It doesn't.
2010,1,Uninstall need to move to SD card
2010,5,Love it!
2013,5,Liked it.
2010,4,It works on droid 1
2011,4,.encurU
2010,3,"Works great, but is not very stable. Tends to lock up at times when you enter date info. Crashed ones. Samsung Vibrant"
2010,4,"Great app, works perfect. But on the widget it doesn't show price in British pounds, just us dollars. Pls fix."
2010,4,Great app just needs a hotel & plane button. Sometimes you need pricing for package deals. Btw I use a mytouch
2010,1,"I rarely book flights, thusly i hardly ever use the app... yet it constantly starts up and runs in the backgroud. FAIL! Uninstalling! :-("
2010,5,Best app for android. Searches everywhere. Incredibly useful. I use it even when I have access to a computer.
2010,4,One of the only travel search programs on here that will search all areas. Most of the other ones only find things in the bigger cities like Orlando
2010,5,Impressive! A must have for any globetrotter. Works on milestone
2010,1,Can't even find a flight from London to jerez via Madrid on it. Rubbish
2010,1,"Says no flights found for any date,ridiculous. Uninstalled"
2010,1,Opens randomly prices in widget are wrong continues to track flight after removing several times on evo
2010,5,Great app. Fast and few updates
2010,5,Extremely nice and works fine. X
2010,3,Would give it a 5 if map search was included
2010,2,"Won't sync to calendar, says no calendar is available"
2010,5,Great app. Great features.
2010,4,Force closes alot but otherwise its good
2010,1,Find cheaper fares online. Worthless app.
2010,5,Perfect except a slight graphics rendering issue on the DROID X
2010,1,Why issue updates with no change log?
2010,5,Consistently the best flight prices I've found
2010,5,Love the app!
2010,5,Great travel source must have
2010,1,Crap quicker to phone the airport
2010,4,Good stuff
2010,4,Great!
2010,5,AWESOME!
2010,3,Where's map search?
2010,3,"Nice UI but: 1.Widget shows prices in $, not what I select. 2.Some fare alerts show a NA symbol. 3.'Flights' is not searching exactly the date I want."
2010,1,"Initially logged in online using FB login. Result: cannot login to app. Says I don't have an account with kayak. therefore, app is currently useless"
2010,1,Used FB to sign up then says I do not exist and cannot sign in even though I got confirmation email. 1 star til fixed. Samsung Vibrant
2010,5,Works perfectly on EVO 4G Froyo. Easier than most websites. Love it. Booked 2 tickets today.
2010,1,Rubbish. doesn't do anything. search always fails removing it from my phone right now!
2010,2,"Love the site, + app flight tracking is great, but alert program constantly runs and drains battery. Uninstalled."
2010,1,According to the app there are no flights out of London to canada in December. Somehow I don't think so! Application fail!
2010,4,So far so good. I'm really impressed with this app. Definately better than other travel booking apps I've found so far. -X
2010,3,"Does not auto update flight or price alerts on widget...fix this, and 5* rating...motor droid"
2010,4,Works great. 5 stars if it gets multiple cities destination.
2010,4,Extremely useful app! Works great on my EVO!
2010,1,Worthless junk. Have installed and deleted several times. Cliq
2010,5,Love this app... nothing is better then this! Got tix already..
2011,3,New update is terrible. Forces closed all the time
2010,2,Program works but the prices it finds for air travel are 5x more expensive than at expedia
2010,2,Widget doesn't work. Needs help.
2010,4,Would love to see an embedded frequent flyer miles tracker otherwise quality app
2010,4,Limited search options but useful for looking up some quick info
2010,2,Please correct the 'FORCE CLOSE' issue for the EVO.
2010,5,LOVE IT!!! Saved us between $200 and $300 on a last minute flight! WAHOO!!!
2010,3,+quick search +good sort/filter options
2010,4,Real nice for booking/ finding your travel needs

2010,5,Perfect
2010,3,Needs move to SD
2010,5,All in one!
2012,2,Needs apps2sd
2010,4,"The widget didn't seem show the best prices, but the app itself helped me find some good prices. It seemed quicker to use than the website."
2010,5,"Love it on my EVO used it for a last min. VAC. To ca. And it helped out with everything.hotels,3 of them and flights. It's a keeper thanks."
2010,5,I was able to get better deals here than with many online services. Organizing my trips is a breeze. No FC on LG Ally.
2010,4,Good app. Pretty 'close' to real time. Not always accurate but neither are airline websites...or thier airport sched's.
2010,4,Great app. Only change should be to add web only offer prices. Found 2 tickets with this app so far but used pc to get web offer.
2010,5,Works extremely well! I took care of my entire trip to Germany threw this app.
2010,3,"It's a good app, but doesn't have multi-destination flight search, you have to search for one way flights, which is not very convenient"
2010,5,I used Kayak on a recent trip to Europe & the airfares & accom'n were the best available compared prices with other well known websites. Love it!
2010,5,I love this app. It's convenient and perfect for the person that's on the go a lot. HTC Incredible!
2010,1,Untested. Calendar buggy as all crap. Displaying Friday on calendar but comes back as Thursday.
2010,4,Good app force close when triyng to track flight but other than that works decently
2010,2,Selecting a date in December 2010 calendar returns wrong day for arrival/departure
2010,4,New version much better on Samsung Captivate.
2010,5,Best thing to find cheap and great flights. LOVE IT
2010,5,Got us a sweet deal for our Missions trip!
2010,3,"Needs hotel price alerts, not just flights."
2010,1,Login update please!!!! Uninstalling at the moment
2010,1,Force close every time on Htc Evo.
2010,5,Great app for the Evo..
2010,5,Cool I can search for flights and places
2010,1,Force closes constantly. Moto droid.

2010,4,Love it!!
2010,1,No use out of Scottish airports
2010,1,Does not open on DroidX
2010,4,should have pet option
2010,3,"Widget is USELESS! Info is wrong, I have to go back in and RE-enter the same info everytime I use it. Would be nice if it worked as an actual ALERT..."
2010,2,"Runs ok, but desktop widget does not show correct price as in full app search. Disappointed bc I wanted the alerts. HTC Eris"
2010,4,"Widget does not keep report settings, ie one way & one traveler. Got a great deal though! Fix and get 5+ stars!"
2010,3,"App works well, but wont allow me to track rates. Tells me to enable widget even though I have. Eris"
2010,1,"Nice looking app, however flight search returns no results no matter what I try. Hotels come back with no prices. Please try testing your app!"
2010,2,"Severely broken - couldnt store flights of interest. Kept using battery/network in the background, even though i wasnt using it for anything!"
2010,4,"Nice app, needs an option to see whole calendar when choosing departure and arrival dates for flights. Would make it easier to plan trips."
2010,2,Widget hardly ever works. Full search wont even sort correctly. Fix these bugs please
2010,5,Excellent! Best Flight tracker too with a nice widget. Perfect interface. Well done dev and designer!
2010,5,I enjoy using this. Especially having a trip planned out and having the option to log in and get all the info from your phone. Very useful. HTC Evo
2010,3,"Ok, but needs more filters (eg for pet friendly). Symbols are not explained anywhere. Good flexible search."
2010,4,Great app for finding airfare and hotels. Lots of options. Widget does not work on moto Droid.
2010,4,Wish that the app could order tickets for you. It directs you to another website to book your reservations. Sometimes the partner site doesn't work.
2010,4,Fairly decent for hotels. A suggestion would be to search and sort based on distance from a particular address/intersection a la HotelsByMe. Great!
2010,4,Love the app. Would be five stars if the widget showed anything but NA . Really too bad because a working widget would make this.
2010,0,Great app! But the update doesn't have the add fare alert to ur widget and that was the best part
2010,1,Touch anything. It force closes. Doesn't recognise cities very well when it works. Behold ii
2010,3,"Widget not reporting lowest rate. I think this would be great, but please fix!"
2010,2,Widget doesn't update flights after first day. Ruins the point of the app... Eris.
2010,2,"Has my local international airport , Bournemouth but doesn't come up with any results that show on the website ante same for other airports in the UK."
2010,2,Looks good but the widget is quoting the wrong fare. Says 997 when it's 299!
2010,2,"Got this to watch flight prices on widget. Always shows ""N/A"" for price. Useless junk."
2010,1,"Shows NA for the price in the widget, which should have been the coolest feature of this app. Nexus one."
2010,1,Tried to track one flight. Couldn't tell me that it was delayed 15 min. Useless for flight tracking.
2010,3,"Great interface and look, has lots of good information but the flight tracker doesnt work for me, wont refresh flights."
2010,3,Unable to search for same-day flights. The website allows for this type of search but this app does not. Sucks.
2010,1,"Doesn't seem to work on my Motorola Dext. Tried several searches on different occasions and just says ""no flights found"""
2010,4,"Looks good, but found precisely zero results on every flight and hotel search. Maybe not designed for UK?"
2010,2,I wanted this app to work. But the filters don't yield accurate results. :(
2010,1,"Tried a hotel search several places all over the world, but search failed every time. HTC Desire, Denmark"
2010,4,Great program. The flight alerts option never seems to work for me.
2010,4,Love the website! All works well On droid eris.
2010,2,"Goodd idea but it would help if it worked..., as everyone else is saying, constant 'no flights found' bug ..even from london to new york!"
2010,1,"Consistently showed the wrong date/location results for my car search, no matter how many times I entered the information I needed."
2010,3,Decent app..but a little slow..doesn't give an option to book more than one thing together...expedia app please!
2010,3,Widget reports the wrong current price. Otherwise very handy.
2010,1,Tells me no flights between cities I've flown often... spokane wa and detroit mi
2010,5,I love this app! No more waiting on a page to load. Motorola cliq xt
2010,3,"App is good, but still changes to landscape mode even if the auto rotate option is disabled in system settings"
2010,4,Works as advertised. No changelog so only 4 stars.
2010,5,This app is awesome! So many functions. Moto Droid
2010,5,Holy bajeeezus... kayak went from clark kent to super man on this app... nicley done... awesome on moto droid
2010,3,Worked great the first time but widget stopped working next day and only says N/A now
2010,1,Great web site but app force closes with EVERY search...moto droid..plz fix
2010,4,Great app. Widget blows. Droid
2010,1,"Flight search is useless , can't find a single flight in local .needz a lot of thinking"
2010,3,"Want to love this, but widget is flakey and doesn't seem to work properly on Evo."
2010,2,No result. Even between London - Stockholm... Useless
2010,3,"More useful than trying browse full site on mobile screen, but not always accurate."
2010,1,What a horrible app!! Not worth the download due to frustration.
2010,4,No problems on Evo. Alerts and widget need work but still the best travel app out right now.
2010,4,"Great program, but i'm not traveling right now. So I uninstalled"
2010,3,Seemed to be good at what it does but it caused my CLIQ to lag. Had to uninstall
2010,2,"Sure it showed me prices but it keeps searching prices for friday to friday instead of the dates i entered. Also, force close on my Droid"
2010,1,"Cannot find any flights, no matter what I try :("
2010,1,"No results searching any flights! Shame, looks nice."
2010,1,Flight search came back with no results. Very disappointing
2010,4,"Good app, would like to see buses like greyhound ect. also."
2010,5,Saved my life.... the biggest thanks for the developers.....
2010,4,Love the widget. Easy to use.
2010,1,"Terrible performance, hosed my nexus so bad I had to uninstall it"
2010,3,"Brilliant flight comparison functionality, but smallness of buttons in the UI is a little vexing"
2010,5,Super smooth app. Can't wait for my next trip
2010,5,Great to keep an eye out on fares while on the go. HTC Hero.
2010,5,Great app! Makes it so easy to look up fares.
2011,5,"Great app, BuT SINCE LAST UPDATE THE APP WAS ALWAYS RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND AND EATING MY BATT. fix it and i will reinstall"
2010,5,Wish I wasn't always running out of room on my hero. I'll reinstall when I get my droid x.
2010,3,Its very slow; you got to fix it. <N-1 Froyo>
2010,3,Torrie can't get flight and hotel packages. Had to look separately
2010,1,Unable to find flights from London to France. Epic fail.
2010,2,"It only gave me the right dates the first time I searched, now it only gives me Friday 2 friday only"
2010,5,Great app with everything you need to know!...moto droid
2010,5,Best vacation search engine for the Droid...works awesome...(Eris)
2010,3,The widget integration sucks search is improving though
2010,5,Wow This works great on my Nexus 1.
2010,5,GREAT app. Makes me wish I traveled more
2010,5,The realtime flight status is really good. HTC evo.
2010,5,2Mb... I wish it were more lightweight!
2010,1,Cheaper to buy on the normal sites than with this.
2010,1,Freezes too much. Droid
2010,5,Very well made. Great pricess too.
2010,5,"I travel constantly, this is a life saver. Incredible."
2010,4,Needs a add to calendar for the Trips feature
2010,1,unable to find any flights at all.
2010,4,Good app. Could be better
2010,4,Good app. It does what it says.
2010,5,All in 1 place & user friendly....
2010,5,Moto Cliq-wonderful app!
2010,3,Doesnt show same days as entered.... WHATS UP WITH THAT?
2010,5,It got me some really good prices
2010,4,Excellent and easy to use!
2010,5,wow out if all the internet sites I searched this android app has the lowest prices hands down!
2010,5,Great app! Loves it!
2010,2,Rates are better thru expedia.
2010,5,Very cool App. A must have
2010,1,Never any flights found
2010,1,Pathetic. Worst application ever.
2010,2,Doesnt seem to use the dates i set for the airline query
2010,5,"Used it for just about everything. Find flights, check flights, keep up with my flights."
2010,4,Great app!
2010,5,Wigit is wrong. Otherwise kayak is awsome
2010,1,Doesn't do hotel flight combo
2010,3,Can't search near an address.
2010,1,Constantly starts itself for no reason.
2010,3,No multicity search like the itouch version
2010,4,convenient & useful app...
2010,4,Bada__s app. Cant wait to travel again.
2010,4,Got the job done.
2010,5,Great app!
2010,5,Great mobile app.
2010,4,No vacation search via app...
2010,5,Great complement to the website!
2010,5,best flight app ever
2010,1,it doesnt have pix of the hotel...
2010,5,Best travel app on android 5*
2010,5,Pure awesomeness.
2010,5,Works good for me on my droid
2010,4,Prettty good
2010,3,Widget is super buggy.
2010,5,Great app ;)
2010,5,I love this app....
2010,5,Awesome!!!!!!!! ~ eris
2010,5,Amazing!
2010,5,This apparently is great
2010,5,I love this app
2010,5,Nice !
2010,5,The best
2010,3,Widget not working
2010,4,Force closes at times
2010,5,fantabolous...!
2010,3,I ch
2010,5,Does what it says!
2010,4,Great improvement! Implement a full calendar view that shows best fares. Animate your loading splash screen like you do on your site and TV ads.
2010,4,Very good app! About time we can check flights like this. Will give 5* if it had an ANNUAL best fares trend chart. Not just a month.
2010,5,"Works on my MotoDroid running CM 5.0.6.2. If you're getting force closes while running CM, run Fix Permissions in the Rom Manager and reboot."
2010,5,"Update works great for me on Moto Droid, and the new features come close to bringing the complete functionality of the web site to the mobile app."
2010,4,I love the exit button. Very few programs miss this obvious memory/battery life saver!!!
2010,3,Good but have to kill app manually...always running otherwise
2010,4,For some reason it installed two icons on my droid. A big one and a small one
2010,5,"App looks sharp on Droid. Pretty simple now, but has the foundation to grow into a great app."
2010,3,Force closes of acore with the widget on the Pulse. Avoid.
2010,4,Great app works awesome on my incredible good job
2010,4,Works pretty well and is great for researching flights.
2010,2,What's up with all the required permissions?
2010,4,Better then the kayak website
2010,1,Crappy interface
2010,4,Its ok i guess
2010,4,I like this app a lot
2010,3,I'll give it a 3 for now. Lots of promise and the best on Android yet but it keeps on FC'in or freezing. Needs more menus in the submenues. Droid 2.1
2010,4,Very good app for Android. But.. hotel searches don`t let u search by amenities. Bummer!
2010,4,I like it. But can we get more feedback on the search button? Hard to tell if it's been pressed. Thanks.
2010,1,It doesn't work... I input from NYC to cleveland to find flights and it gave me Boston? Very dissatisfied (Droid)
2010,3,When it works - it is useful. When it Fcloses - it is useless. Doesn't handle multiple task well. Droid
2010,2,Why so many permissions? Stay out of my contact book. Does not offer much more than the website.
2010,5,This is awesome! All you need to know if your location doesn't work is part of the airport name! It even has small airports! It's great!
2010,3,"I like kayak in general, but when i tell it to sort hotels by price, it won't. When the filters work, i will rerate. Moto droid"
2010,4,Very easy to use. Works very well. Highly recommend it.
2010,5,"Absolutely blazing fast app on my MyTouch! Could use a little more customization to catch up with the website's power, but this app is a huge help."
2010,3,A wonderful thought gone slightly awry. Kayak continues to freeze. Anxiously awaiting a remedy for this.
2010,4,Great app. Hotels flights and car rentals all in one. 5 if it had more hotel details.
2010,1,Won't show details of upcoming trips. Force closes when try to leave feedback. Droid. Uninstalling.
2010,4,Not updating to the new version which asks for all kinds of crazy permissions! :(
2010,2,Too US focused. Doesn't always display flights. Didn't return the obvious flights.
2010,3,Good app. Helpful with prices. Should add cruise itineraries
2010,5,Works great! Previous update fixed issue with flight notifications.
2010,5,"Great app, I always find great deals and I'm glad I can use it now on my phone"
2010,5,Everything u need for travel. Quite impressed. Can even book from mobile device. Very cool.
2010,3,Would like to see mapped for all results and not have to click on each result to see where it's located. Otherwise it's getting better.
2010,3,"Love this on my motorola droid, but force closes when i try to exit, fix that and 5 star app."
2010,1,Has no need to seach Personal Information. Stay out of Contacts and other irrelevant infomation.
2010,5,Works great on my G1! Love this app
2010,3,"""trips"" doesnt display important info, like my confirmation #, which i need to check in"
2010,1,This is a horrible app i can even type in florida as my destination an only says no results found uninstall
2010,5,Kayak fan for years. Works great on Droid.
2010,5,"Great app and good alternative to Kayak website now that UK server added, just needs option of searching multiple flights."
2010,4,Nice. Splash screen kind of annoying...takes like 10s to go away and wastes away my life.
2010,2,"3.2 megs?! Too much, otherwise fine, but needs polish to be great"
2010,1,Search failed please try again message every time when searching for flights on Droid
2010,1,Searched for a flight on my droid. It said search complete 797 results but page was blank...
2010,4,"I would like to bookmark a flight i have checked the status of, so i can look at it again easily"
2010,5,"Combines all airlines, airports, and travel websites into one place. Great!"
2010,5,"Cool app, but way huge. Needs 2 b optimized and then might reinstall"
2010,2,"Cant rely on ap to work. Website is awesome, ap is lousy."
2010,3,Doesn't show all the cheapest flights out there. Waiting for the hotwire app
2010,2,"Rental car searches always sends the default week long date range to the web sites, not the dates I choose."
2010,4,Great app...the continued updates are better each time!
2010,5,"Used it to plan my international trip, monitor prices, and sort by shortest length. Worked perfectly."
2010,1,This application wants to know way too much about me with little reason.
2010,5,"Awesome! I don't travel much, when I do ill be using this for sure!"
2010,1,"Useless, since you can't sign in."
2010,5,Brilliant flight and hotel checker.options include setting a UK server and having prices in British pounds.
2010,5,"It works amazing,booking a flight has never been easier!"
2010,5,Great app. Can't travel w/o it!
2010,5,great app....easy to navigate the areas and prices are cheap
2010,5,Result always bring back 0 returns. Using a Droids.
2010,3,It's nice but it force closes on reorientation
2010,5,"I love it, wks great on my droid!"
2010,5,It would be nice to save items to look at later on the computer.
2010,1,Wont search on verizon Droid. Bad.
2010,1,Keeps on crashing and Trips doesn't work
2010,1,Keeps force lo closing totally worthless
2010,3,Isn't all that great to use.
2010,1,Just randomly stopped showing results
2010,5,This app is amazing! Very quick and useful!
2010,3,Wish it could search flexible dates
2010,4,Great now it has UK servers
2010,3,Take long time to open
2010,3,Very use full and accurate
2010,4,Great app easy to use
2010,5,Works great on my moto droid!
2010,5,Great for searching for flights from multiple engines!!
2010,3,This app has almost nothing to do with paddling.
2010,3,OK but needs a filter by time.
2010,1,Fc every time. Droid touch
2010,1,Would not open. Installed twice...
2010,3,fc more than I'd like.
2010,4,Needs to have multi city feature added.
2010,5,Very easy and useful!
2010,3,Why does this app need to change my wifi state?
2010,5,works great on moto droid.
2010,2,Why so many permissions? Uninstall until fixed.
2010,2,Freezes. Uninstalled
2010,5,Sweetness <3 it!
2010,4,Holla good
2010,5,Great app..
2010,3,Force closes on Samsung Moment
2010,1,Never opens and when try force closed
2010,4,great!
2010,2,Crashes and click problems
2010,5,EASY TO USE
2010,5,Great tool
2010,5,Amazing and easy
2010,1,Would not open.
2010,5,Great
2010,1,Crashes frequently
2010,1,Lame
2010,5,Works on the Evo
2010,3,Interface is a little clunky and app takes awhile to open! Just use their site.
2010,3,Login failure. Crashes frequently. Aside from that great app idea just needs some work.
2010,5,Works Great with MY TOUCH. IT'S LIKE HAVING A TRAVEL AGENT IN YOUR POCKET.
2010,4,Great app but i cant sort by cheapest since the latest update.
2010,4,"Fast search, but why can't I see any evening flights??? That's why it's a 4."
2010,5,"Some of the features are still not working, but it's a great easy flight look-up"
2010,4,Please include the weekend trip search feature!
2010,5,like it ....droid
2017,3,"Good app. Easy to use. Great filter options. My biggest issue: the emails. You can turn off your notifications and still keep receiving updates on every single trip you seaeched for. It is so frustrating. It's not helpful; its spam mail that I opted out of several times. It's annoying and makes me not want to use the app because I don't want the junk emails. STOP SPAMMING PEOPLES EMAILS. If I want more information and trip updates, I will opt in or out myself. So, for that I only give 3 stars. With this fixed, it's a 5 star app."
2015,1,I booked a hotel through the KAYAK app as I was driving from Miami to Atlanta. When I checked in I was informed that KAYAK had cancelled my reservation without informing me! This is not what a weary traveler wants to deal with after driving 600+ miles straight. I had to find another room to sleep in. Thank you KAYAK for the beautiful useless app!!! It has been deleted from my phone. Weary travelers beware!!!
2016,1,Booked car got confirmation number got to airport to pick up car and they wouldn't take my visa debit card ...saying I need a credit card what's the point of having visas name on debit card. .then I call number to complain and there closed on weekends sends me to Alamos customer service... have to travel 2hrs back to friend who took me to pick up cars house to try and get this straightened out...very upset now iam not gonna make it back in time to do a job gonna lose thousands of $...
2018,2,"I guess this was a unique experience but being a student I am always 
looking for cheapest way to fly. Well this app redirected me over 9 times 
to cheapest flights which were apparently supposed to be full and 
unavailable. These 'hook' flights are very annoying and it seems the only 
agenda there is to keep customers cycling through the process till they get 
tired and book a higher price flight. Genuine disappoinment."
2015,1,"I don't know why, but the app will NOT resolve the internet nor find airports by code or city name.  I've removed and reinstalled with no luck. All of my other apps connect just fine. In fact, the reason I installed it again today was because I was searching on Kayaks web site.  Pretty much useless as is. On a Samsung Note 3."
2015,1,"Very dishonest, when you can't uninstall, or take off. You try but it and many others just come back on again. Forcing the phone user to have app.and us storage,batteries, that we don't even want. Should be some kind of mass law suits against these companies forcing their app on you."
2012,1,"They say they don't charge for cancellations, but the hotel does. This is not entirely true. I made a reservation and then had to cancel, Kayak did not want to refund my charged amount, even though the hotel no longer showed my reservation and was not charging me for the cancellation. It took over an hour on the phone and different people to get my money back. DO NOT USE if you have the slightest possibility of having to cancel, they will charge you and cancel you reservation and try to keep your money."
2016,2,"There is absolutely NO reason why this, or most apps, need to use my camera! I am getting SO tired of apps wanting MY data or devise control to use their service or info. I'll use another app with less permissions even though I used to like this app on my last phone."
2012,1,"I've installed and uninstalled this app twice on different phones. When searching for flights, it always stops at 99% and never shows results. Often says no network connection despite having a great connection and/or being on wifi. Does this on both my galaxy s3 and G2."
2016,4,"I've been using this app since 2012 and it's really great having a record of details of trips booked. I've also used it to make flight booking when I had to change plans in a hurry. However there is a problem in loading trip details, it seems to take for ever. This wasn't the case originally when I started using it in 2012. But has been slow in recent times. Needs to be addressed."
2017,1,"I can't use the explore option, so it's useless. I see all the places to go, but not where they are... The map isn't loading, it's just a grey background with thousands of blue points. I don't want to choose where to go randomly. Reinstalled app already... Using a LG G5 with Android 7.0 all system updates are the latest version, LG provided yet"
2017,2,"Worked for a week, then stopped. I love kayak and found the app very useful the first week i downloaded it. Then i don't know what happened, the app just stopped working. I couldn't set price alerts, and my existing one kept sending me notifications but i would get an error when trying to view the flights."
2018,1,"Used to heavily rely on kayak to find tickets to fly back east. For 3 
months, at least, the prices are not accurate. Show g muchower prices than 
what tickets actuary are. Been usuing kayak for 6 or more years and never 
had this problem until recently. Really stinks when you call your 85 year 
old grandma and tell her your coming to visit with the new baby then have 
to call her back and cancel because tickets are actually 700 each not 350!!"
2016,3,"It seems you can't use flexible dates with the app, while it is available on the website. It makes the app quite useless for me since I use it to get the cheapest flight without strict dates. Also, you can't compare Kayak with other bookers. These features are important IMO. Nice app anyway if you have strict dates."
2012,4,Like this app a LOT! But am a stickler to give any thing a five star. This interface is so clear and really easy to go back and change what you are looking up to keep improving results when looking for price deals.might give five stars if you could set a mile radius for looking for car  rentals instead of only looking by city or airport.
2012,4,1. Like with the regular website - you gotta know how to work with kayak to find better fares than those those you get after one simple search. 2. I wish this app was 20% of its current size because it takes a lot of memory on my cheap galaxy ace phone
2016,2,There were huge gaps in it's resources that meant the prices on flights were hundreds of dollars more than other sites and apps because they don't search some of the major airlines. I can't trust an app when the first flight search I do shows the lowest as $900 and the next place I check is $250 cheaper...sort of false advertising if you are not the cheapest.
2014,3,"When seeking ""hotels near me"" there is no way to tell if the listed options are in my current direction of travel -- I don't want to backtrack.  Would FAR prefer to see suggested hotels on a map (showing my own location for context)."
2013,2,"Why do you require access to contacts, calendars and emails? This seems like malware. I'm very uncomfortable with the knowledge this app will access private information and distribute it at its own leisure and convenience without asking me or even informing me. It's not just me- its targeting anyone I may ever have had contact with. Sorry but no!"
2017,4,"Great app to help book flights. Be warned though, the smaller the airline company, the more research you need to conduct. I'm out 255 because one company requires via to transfer flights in Vietnam. Not stopping, not sightseeing, not stepping outside the airport. Another company makes same travel and does not require via."
2016,3,"Was evaluating Kayak alongside TripCase. I had an issue with Kayak and emailed support. Unfortunately no response. So whilst Kayak looks nicer and the hotel search is handy, I've gone with TripCase as it worked first go (and continues to do so) and I also received a reply from support (for a question, not an issue)."
2017,1,I used to use this app a lot until recently I started noticing the fare prices they list are not at all the same once you start trying to book the flight. Maybe it's a temporary glitch? But I've used this app a lot in the past and this is just something recent that's happened. I deleted the app because it's so upsetting.
2015,1,Installed the app and started using. First thing i observed when i selected sort by price (ascending) It didnt do so properly and showed many cheaper ones at the end instead of beginning. Then i tried booking a tkt which initially showed 20k price but before payment stage showed 75k!! The same tkt on different app was available for 20k.
2012,4,"I use this often, it helps with planning a trip in the spur of the moment. You can set up  notifications for future trips. The best use for this app. Is when your flight gets cancelled, you can find available flights and  it allows to tell airline customer service which flights you rather have than them putting you any flight they chose."
2013,3,"Fantastic easy to use app loved it, however lack of currency converter really annoying and very few options on real budget hotels. Wider date search for cheapest flights would also be good."
2016,1,The kayak desktop site allows for flex dates. You can do up to plus or minus three days. However the kayak mobile site doesn't have this feature and neither does their app. Why am I downloading an app that has fewer features than your website?! I am so tired of lazy app devs.
2014,2,"Norton Mobile tells me the new version looks up all my installed apps and SIM card details. I would want to use Android Kayak, but not with this intrusion. Kayak, you need to avoid the appearance of being sneaky if you want my business."
2013,2,"Really wanted to like the app. Doesn't look as good as TripIt on my DNA, so three stars there. REFUSES to log in on Nexus 7,  either way (Facebook or email), so one star here. Averages to two stars."
2017,1,"Would not let me search for anything, flights, cars, or motels. relating to Portland, Oregon trip in June-2017.    Very frustrating and disappointmenting.  It would take me into Seattle or San Francisco but no closer.  Worthless."
2017,1,Could not get it to work on my phone. Contacted support and they mentioned it is a common issue not encouraging. They asked me for more details but gave me no solutions. Website is great just use that not the app. Wasted way too much time trying to get it to work.
2012,5,"A pretty swanky app that allows you to do everything in planning a trip - book a flight, rent a car, setup hotel accommodations, etc (you think/name it, this thing does it).  Quite impressive to be honest.  However, WorldMate does all the same things, but with a nicer UI - so I went with them.  So similar though, it all rests on personal preference I suppose.  5 Stars!"
2015,1,"Horrible!!! This is not about the application itself, but about this company's service. Basically, I sadly learned that if you book a flight through this website, you have to be strictly attached to whatever itinerary you got. In my case, I needed to make a change and no one was able to help me. I called the airline and they were willing to help me, but Kayak had total control on my ticket and the airline couldn't do anything. The only answers those guys at Kayak know is ""NO"",""I CAN'T"", ""IT CAN'T BE DONE"". Because this is a non-refundable tariff I will lose my money as well ($600). A very poor service! I'll never recommend or use this service no more!"
2013,1,"Keep receiving oops can't connect to Internet message on Samsung Note. WIFI data is on, and all other apps connect. Need this app to work for upcoming trip. VERY annoying."
2014,2,"Like the app, used it a lot, but it looks like they are trying to sneak more permissions in.   Why oh why did kayak need my phone # and the number of whom I am calling with?  Or to read files on my phone?  Time to end the relationship if you are truing to grab my data.  Uninstall."
2012,5,"App is really well designed, and functions very well too. From my use of it so far, it is working very well. The only downside in my opinion is the size of the app, which is not a problem unless you're running out of space. Once again, this is a must have app for travelers looking for a good deal."
2012,4,"App works great! The only reason I gave a 4 not 5 is that every 3rd time I open the app it force closes. Works fine when I reopen, so don't know what the issue is, and it is a minor inconvenience. Use it all the time, even with the issue!"
2013,1,"Made a reservation through Kayak for a hotel. A week and a half later, I called the hotel to upgrade and they didn't have my reservation in the system. Had I not called, I would not have had the room I already paid for. Can't whose fault that was, but I can start by never using Kayak again to ensure this doesn't happen next time."
2013,1,Just downloaded the app and put in a search and it found zero flights a month and a half in advance. Waste of my time! Horrible reliability. Don't even bother.
2013,1,"Absolute garbage. Never finishes the flight search and continues to tell me it can't connect to the internet, even though everything else on my phone will connect. Don't waste your time."
2013,1,"Downloaded the app to search vacation deals, but you have to search for hotel and flights separately. Why not include it in the app if it's on your site? Uninstalling..."
2014,1,"I wanted to quickly check room availability at a place I was going to in 2 days and it would not let me enter the remote address. All I can get is room availability for my current location. Grrrr I am so not happy with Google and associated apps. They do not perform simply as i need them to and they instead force stuff that annoys me on my way to getting simply what i need. If ever I do finally learn how to ride the thing, Google forces an upgrade that effectively makes me have to learn from scratch. Grrrrr"
2015,2,"But you cant really trust the prices.  I've had two incidents where American wouldn't honor the prices that were shown in Kayak and others where other apps showed lower pricing.  There was no customer service number, and email resolution was less than satisfying.  To be fair, it is great for checking schedules."
2016,1,Looked for flights for 3 days about 3 weeks ahead. The flights continued to increase those three days. I cleared my cache  and reinstalled the app and it went back to the first price it advertised. It jumped from $165 to $219 in 3 days!
2014,3,I love Kayak but this app isn't as detailed as I'd like it to be. The deals aren't as good either. I always get better fares when I go on my pc. Weird. So I'll be deleting this again.
2012,2,Worked flawlessly for couple of weeks on my HTC OneX and suddenly almost 9 of 10 searches come back with 'zero flights found' or 'weak signal error'. No improvement despite multiple uninstalls and reinstalls. Hoping there's a known cause and some fix underway for what seemed to be top notch app.
2016,5,"I first found Kayak accidentally a few years ago and it has since served as my travel bible. Kayak have earned my trust by ensuring they offer the best travel deals be it air tickets, hotels or car rentals. I unconditionally recommend Kayak to all avid and casual travellers out there."
2013,3,"I would have given this app 5 stars until today when it guessed wrong and misplaced fights and hotels into two overlapping trips. I would have no problem with the errant guesses, except that I couldn't find a straightforward way to edit events automatically placed within trips. This is a serious deficiency for frequent travelers with overlapping trip dates. Until this is fixed, the app is cute but not seriously useful."
2012,3,Please in the next update make it so u can choose dates around when u want to go. I don't care if I fly on Sept 5 I would rather know if it's cheaper to fly on the 9 th ill take that flight
2017,2,"Prices show low, once you try and book they go up, no good. CHEAPFLIGHTS is much better. This one is a bit useless from my point of view"
2012,1,Trying to identify the map location takes forever now. Can't identify a place to book cause maps doesn't work. Should off stuck wit Gmaps.
2013,5,Havent had a whole lot of time with it yet and not sure if prices are lowest but... Man it works pretty well so far.  Recommened to me by a guy that was fkying to CO to ski.  He was impressed too.
2012,1,Why on earth does thia app need the ability to place phone calls without my having the ability to monitor or stop it? Why on earth would someone allow this app on their phone. I WAS going to download and install but.......forget that.
2015,1,First of all it would not let me enter in that I was traveling with kids. I have two children and need that option. Also the prices were 300 dollars over any other site or app that I've tried. Deleting this app.
2013,1,Searches simply don't complete.  They hang at 98-99% the vast majority of the time.  Happens in both Android and iOS.  Surprised Kayak can't get this right on mobile.
2013,5,"Amazing! My boyfriend John's been booking 2 to 4 biz flights/month for himself for more than 20 years & he has it down to a science.  Kayak found the same best deal that he did, but 5 times faster!  Now, if Kayak could show that upgrading to 1st class was only a small faction more, it'd have John beat!!"
2013,3,Tried search for flight from MHT to SJC.  It would only show flights to and from BOS. A multi-city route search always returned to the starting city even though that's not what I specified. Concur app gives me the desired results. Sorry Kayak.
2012,3,"App works very well on just about any device. At 10+ MB it is, however, a large sized app taking much space for older devices. 1-star less for size."
2013,3,"Even when you sort by lowest price, this Kayak app does not put the cheapest flights first. Very disappointing. Hotels were better and the app makes it easy to book, but the flight issue left me sour."
2013,2,it worked really well in the past. but now it doesn't update my trips after I forward my travel itineraries to them. please help do something about it!
2013,1,The andriod version of this has a very ugly ui compared to its iOS version. The functionality is totally fine. Please update the UI asap
2020,1,"WTF -- new version forces you to sign in! Kayak zensiert bei der Flugsuche -- Flüge nach Iran, Kuba oder anderen Zielen, mit denen die US-Regierung Probleme hat, sind nicht suchbar (selbst auf der deutschen Seite) -- auch wenn renommierte Fluggesellschaften Flüge dorthin anbieten. Wo soll das noch hinführen?"
2013,1,"for instance...select a departure city, then, use the tool to select nearby cities, and what happens? YOU SEE A LIST OF CITIES NEAR YOUR CURRENT LOCATION! Huh?? why would I need to search for cities near where I'm located when I'm doing an airfare search? on well... whomever developed this app must not travel."
2011,4,Nice app. Good filtering functions on results list. Appreciate the calendar function when picking dates (rather than android's default dropdowns).
2015,1,All it does is show me a Priceline ad after I search. It takes up most of the screen and there's no way to view my results. So I hit the back button to get to the search form. Then it just freezes and turns black. Whomp whomp whomp.
2013,1,Read what privileges you  allow them to have on your data and location! This app allows them to send emails  without informing you and allows access to private data. It also has privilege to erase data... do they really need that type of acess?? Check all your apps that you download!
2012,4,Call the hotel first. There are 3 prices internet phone and hotel desk. Find out what you get with each and then take your best price.
2012,2,Works well but has no option to change currency. Only shows prices in US dollars. Should mention in description that only dollars available.
2017,2,"Flight prices differ pretty vastly from the actual web, might even be non-existent in the web. They also don't update nor does the app notify you of changes."
2015,2,The app is ok for searching but is slow and sometimes glitches or freezes. Had one instance that I was trying to book a room and it wouldn't respond when I tried to submit the reservation then had the same exact issue on the website. Downloaded an app from another service and had no issues.
2016,1,"This site would show great fares, the....you click on book, it takes you to the airline site with a message..."" the fare we found is over 10 hours old, the new fare is..xxxxxx.  always way more than what Kayak showed.  Very fraudulent."
2015,5,Works seamlessly with the website. Makes planning trips easy and efficient. The itinerary tool is simply fantastic and keeps me on task. Sending email confirmations to Kayak through email and seeing that task automatically added to my itinerary is great. I love this app!
2012,5,"Great and easy to use, just like the full website. There are a few filters and features that are not included but it doesn't take away from the app's utility."
2013,1,This app can access your confidential information and send emails without your permission.  READ THE INSTALL TERMS. Don't install these invasive apps. Send these app developers a message and uninstall their products.
2017,2,"It only shows prices for a single ticket even when you put in 2 people, and bumped it up to first class when I requested business class. Why put in search filters if they're going to ignore them?"
2013,1,"I had this app awhile ago and LOVED it. I uninstalled due to lack of travel.  I just recently installed a second time and its awful. Keeps telling me ""no flights available"" ""no Internet connection"" when clearly there  one.	Augh"
2014,2,On Samsung Note 3 and Moto Droid Ultra... cannot consistently get to Add Event from the active Trip page  Frustrating. Uninstalled
2012,4,"No doubt this is the best travel app available for Smartphones.  Works well on my Galaxy Note 2.  The ""Trip It"" function also works like charm."
2014,2,"This is the second time I've uninstalled this app. I keep forgetting how useless it is, especially compared to their excellent web app. Why can't I filter for anything?  It is OK to check a price in some general way, but not good for actual booking."
2018,1,"Every time I'd tried to search I had to verify not a robot and then had to 
do the grid verification cars, signs etc. Never got beyond this. Said 
failed over and over. Uninstalled app."
2014,1,I have had this app working for a while and has been useful but today it can not find a flight anywhere. Have installed updates but App not working for me at the moment. Have uninstalled till this bug is fixed
2014,5,App runs quite smoothly. Has all the features of the full site. The Alerts are great. Kayak should include a text notification. But still one of the best travel apps available
2017,3,"app use to be great, but now crashes all the time as you are booking... often double booking flights (""oops something went wrong, please check your email"")"
2011,5,LOVE THIS APP! Use MyTrips to get a handle on my weekly business trips just by forwarding emails.  The calendar sync makes 24 hour check-in a breeze!
2010,4,"Have only played around, but seems very cool. Looking fwd to seeing what updates they add! (Droid user)"
2016,5,Been travelling around the world and used this for price comparison - saved me a fortune! Now using it mainly in europa for travelling between england and switzerland. Don't want to live without it anymore!
2014,5,"This app pretty much has it all. Flight search, hotel search, airport info, etc... It is essentially a one-stop-shop. In addition to all of the options for booking travel, it includes a flight tracker, which will provide up-to-date info on any flight"
2012,1,Kept saying weak network signal but  signal is 100% and every other app connects okay. Had to abort search for local airport.
2012,2,"I used this app a bit when I was planning a large trip. It worked okay, but the website is still better.  I deleted it because of its unnecessary permissions, accessing too much personal data."
2012,5,"I've hardly had to go to any other aggregator... I sometimes had to go to some direct airlines site such as southwest, but this portal gives all other results.. thank you, Kayak.. you guys rock!"
2012,4,"Flights section Works great. Search, sort & filter functions work great. Flight tracker was incorrect first & only time using it."
2012,2,The app keeps force closing.. it force closes after using it for maybe 1 or 2 minutes. Soooooo annoying. If it stopped doing this it'd be great.
2016,4,Can I have the option to select only non stop flights before searching? It's annoying to have to wait for the search to finish then change the setting and wait for it to search again.
2013,5,"This app is stable, speedy and functional, unlike all the carrier apps I have on my phone. If you can't find the flight you want with this app, then it probably doesn't exist."
2012,2,"US specific, same dumb design as all the others.  Skyscanner is way better.  What you want is easy searches for flights - this app doesn't do it."
2015,4,Only giving 3 stars because the mobile app stalls quite a bit and won't show photos of hotels sometimes. Perfect for searching flights and car rentals but issues with hotel searches.
2012,4,"I love this app, my only problem is when entering the number of people theyre automatically adults. I have two kids and that can be a big price difference for certain things. Fix this and it's five star."
2012,5,"It has everything you could ever ask for! Phone numbers, flight tracker, itinerary, packing lists and much more! Love love love this app! If you travel frequently, this is the app for you!"
2012,2,"The first time I use this app it seemed to work great, returned tons of flight options, then search something else and come back and get ""no results found""."
2014,1,"App fails to find a single airport... Did you know that Kuala Lumpur doesn't exist? Neither does London, Melbourne... We are all an illusion"
2013,5,I really like the easy-to-use interface and the variety of different features.  Give it a try and you can see for yourself!
2013,1,"Sorry, KAYAK Developers.  I will NOT allow this app to modify/delete my friends calender events.  Sorry that I must uninstall."
2012,5,"Better than the website! Easy to use, fast, organized. Has filter options, sort by price or time, and remembers your search history. Love it!"
2012,5,My #1 travel app in ny iOS & Android. For the past 4 years Kayak has become my travel partner. Thanks guys for this lovely app. Cheers
2014,1,"The airplane logo keeps spinning while searching and eventually states ""Kayak has stopped"" and that happened several times. The App is up to date. Frustrating. I uninstalled it."
2011,5,Really I don't know how to explain how phenomenal this app is. And it alerts you when a cheaper price is endurable. Samsung Epic 4g
2014,3,Kayak hotel rates always come up lower than others but when you go go book the rate is higher. Pretty much useless. Flights are good though.
2009,1,"OMG does this draw a constant vacuum! Stupid splash screen, plus location input enters infinite loop. .. Un-installed."
2017,4,The browse feature is amazing. You can use it to find all flights in a periode of time and then decide which direction is the cheapest. Great feature!
2016,5,"I tried several of these travel management apps, and Kayak is the one that works best for me. It's intuitive and flexible and easy to use. I recommend it."
2012,2,"I like the website, but this app has access to pretty much all your privacy. Way  more so than any competitor. Read permissions carefully."
2012,2,"Really wish Google play would stop recommending apps that don't offer even basic localisation - eg. Currency symbols. As it is I've no idea if prices just have the wrong symbol or have been converted into USD... also, looks naff on tablet."
2018,5,"Between this app, Google, and Hopper, I can plan any trip any where. Pretty 
awesome! It does open many windows but it is a safe app."
2013,4,"Awesome app for flights, runs smooth, simple. Wish they would extend it for trains and busses! Would get all my tickets from there!"
2016,4,Use it for most of my travel. Excellent App! Only withdraw is that Kayak stopped showing booking clases 😕
2013,5,"With KAYAK available on Android,  it has become very easy to plan travels & book tickets online very fast yet cheaper when compared to other travel websites. Great site."
2012,4,"Helpful, fast. Can usually find what I need, though occasionally freezes up or search stops spontaneously. But overall glad to have it."
2013,2,Please consider to remove those 2 new permissions (read my calendar and send emails?) . It's the best travel app but I will not update. .
2014,5,Needs more navigation points but its fast and works great. Be sure to double check lowest fares as they don't always sort properly.
2017,4,Kayak app is almost as robust as their website. Prices aren't getting as low as they used to. i enjoy frequent alerts.
2013,4,Not gonna do the new update too many complaints. Like it the way it is. I do wish it showed price changes like online.
2014,1,"Didn't work offline. Marginal at best when it worked.dumped a lot of spam in my email, not as easy as it should be to unsubscribe. 10/10 would NEVER recommend."
2012,5,Great app just downloaded. Haven't seen it but if not yet they should make option to do bundle deals on the flights motels and cars.
2016,5,"Yea, this is the only search engine I use for flights and car rentals, I've shopped around at first but its silly cause they let a jiggy mothatucker like me know whatsup for the prices on the low, word to kayak, 10\10"
2012,4,Very easy to use and search for all travel related stuff. Used on Iconia tablet as well as Motorola droid2.  Ken
2014,3,"When I close out of the app completely and try to open it back up, it doesn't work. In order for it to work, I have to keep the app open 24/7. Fix it please."
2014,4,Not quite all the features.  Flexible dates and cos matrices can't be pulled up. Otherwise a good place to start
2015,1,Why does a travel app need access to my phone call info and photos?  This is a flight search app...invasion of privacy is a no go.
2023,4,The most recent updates are somewhat less user-friendly than previous ones. Flight tracking is clunky to access and clunky to manage tracked flights
2012,5,"If you are interested in how to tip in many foreign countries around the world, check out my tipping guide: Global Tipping Guide. Thanks guy, have fun travelling !!"
2016,5,"Love the explore feature, simply brilliant. Great for finding affordable options when you are able and willing to have an open time table and a flexible destination."
2013,5,"A friend at work got me hip to kayak just a few days ago and I love it. I have already used it to book a hotel in Nashville at a cheaper rate than I would have on other booking sites I have used in the past. I highly recommend it for frequent travelers, like me."
2012,5,"very user friendly. Lots of in depth and useful info, really lets you drill down to the fine detail."
2011,2,"Frequent crashes. Lacks some useful functionality from web page, such as filter by airline group - Star Alliance, etc. So may as well just use Web..."
2017,5,It's helped me find some pretty amazing flights and usually with airlines I don't bother checking. It's my only way of finding flights for my trips now.
2015,3,I loved the app but it didn't have the option to list a passenger as a child or infant on lap. I would have gave it five stars otherwise.
2013,1,Way too invasive... Accessing my phone book and more stuff like that? No thank you.
2018,1,"Uninstalled... You know there is other currencies in the world than the 
pound!!! once you introduce this feature will think on installing again."
2015,5,"I have been using this app for a long time, really good. It does not always find the cheapest connection, but that has to do with transferring luggage. Moscow to Taiwan, for example, $800. But I found Moscow =&gt; Hong Kong =&gt; Taiwan for $500. But, great app anyway!"
2016,5,"No matter what I'm looking for, this site has provided me with the lowest cost options available. I highly recommend this for all travel booking."
2014,1,Claims price is $297 but is actually after tax $445..... Exact flight on Expedia $297 but $342 after taxes.   No one at kayak could explain why.
2012,1,"This app almost convinced me that there were no flights from Scotland to Greece, only when noticing there were no flights between England and Scotland I realised this is just a pretty app with no real information. I wish I could charge them for the time I spent on this app that I will never get back."
2013,2,"I don't like the new ""call and email people"" feature. I don't need Kayak to do all that for me. Uninstalling."
2012,1,"I travel with/because of my dogs (for competition). If I can't tell whether the hotel allows pets, this app is useless to me."
2012,5,Wow it is so wonderful useful for my need.. It already to show everything where i want to go or stay hotel or find tickets from bus aeroplane car etc etc.. I really thank android app
2016,1,Total bullshit app. After filling out the billing and card info. It kept saying there was a mismatch between the two info. Sections when there was not
2013,1,"Regardless of the quality of the application,  WHY do you require access to my private phone info?? That's enough to make me not install this app!"
2010,5,Fantastic program. Works really well. Not as good as the pc website but still great. It is free so why not
2009,1,"Crashed my phone,had to power off&on. Terrible experience. Why did Kayak ship such a crappy app?"
2015,5,"I use this to find the fare that matches my requirements, filter options are great, and I check back often to see off I can improve on the deal I've received."
2013,5,Very well done travel. Response fast with complete information and maps. I love all then pictures with each hotel.
2016,2,"While buying a ticket the apped displayed that there was 70% chance that the price of the ticket will drop by $20 or more within 7 days.  I bought the ticket, but checked the price daily, I don't know what model they are using for their prediction, but the price rose consistently."
2012,5,"Kayak is so easy to use!  I've got it on 2 phones, a tablet & 2 laptops.  Won't look anywhere else"
2017,5,Kayak wins it again for me narrowly beating sky scanner. I will be booking my family flights with you again for third year in a row.   You are the best in my opinion.
2012,4,Whoa there nellie. I had this app 30 seconds and it asked for a rating. Seems decent but way too soon for a 5.
2016,5,Trusting this company for over 7 years of travel. No problems with them ever! Lowest price too.
2013,1,What a joke. App is useless if it won't connect to the internet and there is nothing wrong with my wifi...all my other apps that require internet access are working.
2015,3,I really like the app but its just nit working well. I have a galaxy s3 and it should and did run great but now Its just not.
2016,5,"Great app, flows well and quick to let me know what the best deals are and if it's a good time to buy! Can't ask for anything more!"
2013,5,Consistent with their desktop site. Love the speed and the sticky destination city! :)
2010,1,Cant get kayak to uninstall/install...do anything. Cant take it off phone so that i can reinstall without factory reset
2020,5,"Works great! Still use this for our yearly trips. Have yet to give a better, cleaner UX."
2015,5,"Multi trip planning is a breeze and still the best deal around.  Easy,  efficient and effective.  Great app"
2012,5,This has helped me find great rates on hotels.  I was checking in to a Holiday inn last month.  My rate was 86$  the lady in front of me paid 147$
2017,5,"This is a great app and unlike others, it provides cheap flights that actually exist.  The Trips feature is great.  Highly recommended!"
2017,1,Why do I now have to have an account to use it?  You don't need an account using a Web page.  Are you selling analytics perhaps? No thanks
2014,5,I love using Kayak to keep track of all of my travel plans. Makes it easy to share details with family and get reminders for check in and store everything about the trip. Also very helpful when looking up flights. All in the same place.
2013,4,"If they had a way where you can input your frequent flyer, rental car company, and hotel number in your account so when they redirect you to purchase its already there. It would get 5 stars"
2013,1,if you update it will send emails and contact your friends without your permission.  i deleted this right away
2013,5,"Easy, fast, I would even say fun to use and plan a trip. The best trip planning app out there. Finds great rates for hotels and flights."
2009,3,Nice ui and very smooth but didn't find what I was looking for. I'll keep for now and see how it progresses...
2017,1,Only shows prices in US currency for Canadian flights. Too many alerts even though prices don't change.
2015,5,"I use it for finding flights to book, hotels, cars, I use it to track my boyfriends flight when it gets delayed or what time it should arrive so I know when to pick him up. 5 stars. Love it!"
2013,1,"App is not working in most of the cases, it always says - internet connection problem, as well as some errors when trying to book something. Very bad."
2018,1,App gave me deals that changed on the real websites and deals that weren't available showed up as well... App is also very slow
2013,1,Read calendar entries with confidential information?  No thanks. Uninstalled. Have a little respect for your users.
2015,2,"Removed the search history. Calendar control is not intuitive, you have to press back button to do the search."
2014,1,"I was looking for a flight, the cheapest one that this app gave was over 200 doallars. Found it through southwest for 126. Dont waste your time."
2013,4,Nothing wrong with this app at all.  Nice tool to have on your mobile device.
2014,4,"in ipad, I can see the total price for flight tickets of more than one person. but not in Android."
2012,1,I downloaded kayak this afternoon and an hour later my whole os crashed! Had to take it to the provider who had to do a factory reset. Will Not be reinstalling.
2010,1,Flight status updates are horrible..i checked 5 mins b4 i got to the airport..it showed me flight was on time.. the flight was actualy delayed by 1 hr
2018,1,"This app keeps popping up as a ad on my phone in every 2 minutes. Help me 
out 😕😕"
2015,5,Runs smoothly.   Just as described without a hitch.  Allegiant air has a horrible mobile site... but you can go through Kayak!   Awesome!
2010,5,Love it! Gets better with each new update. Appreciate how KAYAK listens to feedback. Moto Droid
2011,4,Great app to check flights and compare.  It would be better  if you can book directly from the app instead of being directed to another site.
2017,1,Used to use the app semifrequently but ads started popping up on my homescreen. Lookout said it because Kayak had adware so I had to delete it  and it immediately fixed the problem.
2012,4,"One fix needed,  When I push on the price it changes when the next screen populates in price alerts..."
2012,4,"Great App. Very Useful. Next update include passenger category ~ Adult, child, infant"
2012,2,"Great app, but I can always find cheaper flights on other sites. It seams it does not search some of the major flight operators."
2016,5,"It's quick, easy and I've never had an issue booking, signing in or app issues. Thanks Kayak!"
2012,5,It is right on......I Love Kayak I can find flights as low as $89.00 in one click. Thats directly from the Airport not just hotwire prices. They give you choices on who you can buy your ticket from.
2014,5,I have been looking for best deals when traveling and Kyak is always a surprise that they are the lowest priced!!  very awesome recommend!
2013,3,"Kayak is great of course and the app looks well designed, but it goes off the edge of my screen with no way to scroll and access some of the buttons and info! HTC One X, 4.2"
2016,4,"App works well enough, but prices don't always match,  and can't seem to find a +-3 day filter"
2009,4,"Much better! Faster, smoother than before. Would be awesome if it could search for Train travel times too."
2012,1,"Use my information and calendar events without my knowledge. Realizing this, I just stopped using this spyware."
2017,5,Love the interface. Great for tracking flight prices and booking. Thumbs up!
2012,4,I have found this app very useful. It works well all the time.
2018,1,After updating they removed the option to search for every destination in any price and the price starts from 200 euro. For this I give now 1 star
2012,4,Not so buggy as the version last year. Slicker too.
2014,4,The feature that I use most is Flight Tracker. It would be better if it doesn't save the info from previous search.
2012,5,Impressed. Very useful. Does not have fligbt and hotel combo deals?
2012,4,Very nice touch and feel. Very user friendly.
2014,5,Too bad! This takes a lot more time to sort through 1400 flights one by one. Update: fixed
2014,1,Shows one price...then go to book and its a higher price....then back out and go back in and price goes up again...very deceiving. Price went up $50 in 10 seconds....so I'm deleting the app and booking through travelocity.
2017,4,One of the best apps for flights but prices on low-cost airline tickets are not always accurate.
2012,4,"I would give it 5 Stars, but I can't search a rental car and hotel at the same time as flight, my only issue (would be 4-1/2 Stars if could do half stars)."
2013,3,"priceline better ,, but it is better then last time downloaded,, shouldnt of let me try priceline sorry ,I will keep app, since improving 3 stars for improvements"
2015,5,"I love kayak because it has the lowest prices for flights. It also lets you filter your search so you can narrow it down by flight time,  when you're leaving,  etc. And it suggests when you buy!"
2017,2,"Lately it gave me misleading information about flight details, I am glad that I didn't rely on it 100%"
2014,1,Only let's you book one night. We need a three night stay and it isn't even a option
2012,1,Out of 567 results only 10 had prices (hotel search) just says call for price - I can use yellow pages for that.
2015,5,"I travel a lot and sometimes my schedule changes at the last minute.  I know that I can easily accommodate those changes with Kayak.  Saves me money, time, and headaches."
2012,1,"Told me no flights available, so I checked airline sites directly.  Guess what?  Lots of flights.  Sux."
2012,4,"Not sure whats going on in this app that makes it 12 mb in size, but it does a nice job.  Great for checking prices and booking trips."
2014,1,"Search for flights. No results. Tells me problem with connection. Internet is working fine. Uninstalled and reinstalled, same problem."
2013,4,everything is there: one and done.  very quick and gets you a good variety to pick from and allows to filter according to your needs.
2016,4,Surfs all airlines for the best fare. I Also love the email option where you can get updates.
2013,5,Amazing. Default go-to travel app. Please add Skyscanner's travel to Everywhere option	See summary
2014,5,This app has got very wide options abd very user friendly. Its good one for your travel needs.
2016,5,"I knew this app today, and glad i downloaded it. It helps me looking for cheap flights through other countries"
2013,5,Very user friendly. Highly Recommended........KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK KAYAK.
2012,5,Best app for flights i have ever used. What else could i ask for?  Thanks Kayak.
2015,4,"Keeps getting erased. Otherwise nice app. Heard it's good to do incognito flight searches though, without cookies."
2013,5,"It was so very easy to book a flight for my mom.  It was bright, easy to use and specify details. Much easier than yahoo travel.  I will definitely use again."
2012,4,would give 5 stars but the pics sometimes wont load all the way. Other than that its a great app!
2010,4,"Works well for my european travels. Could be a but more responsive, especially when starting up."
2011,3,Price alerts don't seem to work. I still have to go online and set up alerts manually through my PC.
2013,5,Its nice and convenient to have all available costs in one place. Its like shopping for every option while only staying in one place.
2013,5,Able to search from anywhere without a hitch. Saves alot of time for people who cant sit at a computer all day
2012,4,Good app.  Needs a few more options like suggested optional airports.
2009,4,"UI is a little slow, but other than that, GREAT! A must have free app for travelers"
2012,4,"Only gripe is how once in a while nothing comes up for certain searches.   Other than that, definitely a solid app."
2009,4,"Not a substitute for the website, but good enough to get the idea. Nice layout and usability"
2017,5,This is my go to app for finding the best prices on flights. Very helpful and user friendly!
2013,5,Easy to use. Super fast. Best deals. Enough said!
2014,1,Crashed every time right after payment and I have no way of knowing if the booking happened. Uninstalled and used the swoodoo app instead.
2013,1,The flight tracker is gone. Why? The blurb still mentions it but it's gone. It was really useful. Now uninstalled. Great shame.
2014,4,It will be nice to have a calendar of prices on each date.
2012,4,All the features needed for some who travels a lot. Flight tracking is especially useful.
2012,5,It works well serves a function & as an app can mildly entertain as you search for flights sound the world.
2011,4,Needs more features from the main site. Narrow down time of flights is essential!
2015,2,"Large download,  and less capable than the mobile website (for example, you can't search for flights for children/infants)."
2014,5,"Have used other similar travel sites, but not with as much consistent success and reliability in the information  provided.  Like the fact prices are competitive among offering properties."
2012,5,Awesome My trip to Washington state from Louisiana.. wonderful couldN't ask for  better service better price awesome
2014,1,"This must be the worst calendar selection widget in the history of calendar selection widgets. A shame, considering the site is awesome"
2015,4,Used kayak a number of times. Very good for following fares before booking. Irritated by the app always asking for location. Please stop this
2012,2,"""read personal log file""? What's with the permissions change, Kayak? NOT UPDATING!!!"
2018,5,Most amazing travel site I've ever encountered. Thankyou kayak for making it possible to travel on a reasonable budget and do so more often and to more places than I ever thought I'd set foot in!!!
2015,5,I review it every time and I have to fly (2 times a week) and my company tries to set up the cheapest tickets even if it means waiting several extra hours that are not needed so I show them the diff. In loss of productivity just to make a point and they usually see the advantage
2012,5,"I never buy an airline divert without checking kayak first. That said, Multi trip itineraries and international flight searches can sometimes be clunky"
2012,5,"Good interface, works well. Would like an option to save or pin to my trips."
2013,1,Keeps telling me no flights found but ive searched other apps with the same dates and get flights please fix and ill give more stars
2012,5,"Excellent site to find better flight prices. I like the way kayak includes multiple airlines, to decipher between the best departure and arrival times to meet their customers needs."
2014,5,Love this app. It's a fantastic tool for organizing a busy travel schedule and keeping family informed.
2012,4,its functional and ez to navigate. u can sort and filter out flights quickly.
2016,5,It's great for storing trip information. I've been storing my vacations with Kayak since 2010!
2012,4,"Price notifications don't work, but otherwise a good app."
2013,5,If i could give them 10 stars I would..  The perfect app to check everything. You will never check anywhere else.
2012,5,Works fast and has all the same features as the full website!
2012,1,App is great when it works... But always freezes within use of couple minutes.
2017,1,Cant login. Uninstalled and re-installed 2 times.  Cant deal with the headache.
2013,5,User friendly... must have app for your travel needs.... Cool.....
2012,5,This is my go-to app for flight planning. Very smooth and very wide search of available flights.  Motorola Droid X
2012,5,Easy to use. Fast. As good results as desktop browser.
2016,1,No permite buscar vuelos entre 2 ciudades al tener fija la ubicacion donde se encuentre el celular. Para mi es una pesima aplicacion y por esa razon la desinstale y no la recomiendo a nadie.
2012,4,Way simpler than using the website on a phone and is quick and easy.
2009,4,"Super easy to use, amazing UI! Bought a ticket a minute after installing it!"
2016,4,I sincerely have liked kayak. And hopping to get the best deals from kayak services.
2012,4,Very good app.... easy to use and lots of options...
2016,5,What I like most is the flexibility this app provides to manage my trip booked through any channel. It's very good for booking but trip management stands out for me
2016,5,Have used Kayak to get great flights and prices. A real winner!
2014,1,Worked once. Now it tells me it cannot connect to the internet.
2017,5,"This app is easy to use. I like the map feature, it allows you to see where the deals are in relation to where you want to be."
2016,1,"piece of junk! It worked for a day, then it just kept crashing! useless"
2012,4,Good database of hotels and flighgs. However crashes sometimes.
2014,5,"I find the price to be the best in market when I search, also, the connection between sites is amazing. The other day I bolked a car in 5 min standing in a big line at the airport."
2013,4,Great filters and interface.  But it crashes a lot.
2012,4,First time user of Kayak. App works well on a galaxy s
2014,1,"Priceline beat out every possible ""deal"" this app had so thanks but no thanks."
2015,1,Why the hell would this app need access to my photos? Not gonna happen!!!!  How stupid is that?
2016,5,"User friendly, gives you the option to save your planned trips and brings you all the best deals"
2017,5,Excellent app to find good hotel & flight rate. Always and only use this app to travel
2012,4,Really like the app.. Gives me decently accurate figures for flights.. Easy to use and never crashes..
2012,5,Very useful for quickly checking on prices. Wish history would save though so i could check on 3-4 different flights with fewer keystrokes.
2013,4,Minor irritation - filtering airline on a search result doesn't refresh the search result.
2013,5,Works fast and simple. I always use it to narrow flights down.
2012,5,"Great app works like a charm when searching for flights, thanks."
2012,5,Can't wait to fly home with a cheap ticket thanks to Kayak!
2020,1,"No puedo comprar ningún vuelo, siempre sale que intente luego u otra opción y ninguna sirve, he intentado toda la semana a distintas horas, distintos vuelos y ninguno sirve"
2013,5,If your looking for a flight to anywhere check here first.  I have used them many times.
2013,4,Nice and simple to use. Good source of information. Just what I need.
2016,5,Been using it to book flight and hotel round the world.. Thumbs up kayak
2016,5,Flight with my family on board. Makes me feel a little bit less anxious.
2012,4,It works so fast and is very easy to use. I recomend this.
2015,3,I used to be able to fine tune the time across multiple days. Now I cannot search flights for one evening or the following morning
2013,5,The Kayak app makes finding flights and hotels a smooth experience.  It is really well designed. I also like the price alert function.
2018,5,Great app...easy to use. Good design .Find flight information fast.
2012,4,Time saver. May have to uninstall other travel apps. Nice!
2012,4,"No glitches, easy UI"
2013,1,The time on flight tracker is off by 6 hours. It is a great app other than that. Fix it please.
2013,5,Loads of handy tools. I always use kayak to do my travel booking now.
2012,5,Awesome app! Way cleaner than going to the website on your phone.
2016,5,"This app compares air, hotel, car rental prices for you. It wven allows you to set alerts."
2015,5,"I only use kayak. it's easy, hassle free, and I get great deals"
2015,5,"Used this app in August to travel to my country for my grandma's funeral, I thought the price would be high but it surprised me......extremely fair rates comparing to the others"
2013,5,When you can find tue preferences option to change tye currency it works very well

2012,5,Works perfect great for planning trips. Easy comparison and search tools
2012,2,"Worked fine for about 3 months, but I've tried to search flights to different locations and different times of the year, no results?!?"
2012,5,App works flawlessly. Has probably saved me a lot of $$
2017,3,Combination of hotels +flight... 2 in 2 search would be nice
2015,5,They have done an excellent job. Interface is easy to navigate and was very thoughtful
2014,2,Was working fine the other day. Now it can't find any hotels and says it can't connect and my wifi and data are working properly.
2013,1,This app couldn't find flights that were 6 months in advance. At least cheapoair could do that... Uninstall
2012,4,I can tell already this is gonna be a great app! Thanks.
2017,5,This is my go to app for checking flight prices.  The only downfall is that Southwest isn't included.
2015,5,"While browsing with my android phone,it is extremely convenient to use.I don't need to use my laptop to make complicated flight search.I love it."
2012,4,Obviously not as good as the regular web interface but nice.
2014,4,Not always the very cheapest flights or hotels but always very competitive and has a broad range of options I've used it extensively for a couple of years and would recommend this
2014,2,I'm uninstalling this app because every time I was gonna look up a flight it said could not connect to the Internet mind you I have wifi and my 4G LTE. Uninstalling
2013,5,Works every time and saves me money. All I care about.
2015,5,"Just works. App is speedy, never crashes and has an intuitive layout."
2018,5,Great app! Love to use it for all my trips..
2012,4,Works really well. Used it twice in a pinch.
2012,1,"Why does a travel application need to know so much personal info, do adjustments or contact my contacts without my knowledge?????"
2014,2,Found much cheaper prices on other apps/pages for both hotels and airfare. Not a site I will visit again.
2012,4,Used as a quick reference for itineraries it does as it says.
2015,5,Love this app! My absolute favorite for booking flights and hotels! So fantastic
2012,5,I travel often. I am always sure to check prices here first.
2009,1,I've been trying to figure out for an hour how to enter in location and destination. Gave up and went to website.
2012,5,"This app help me a lot it has everything u might need...cost,info,places n phone number of each airlines....love it"

2013,3,Useless...:(
2016,1,"I installed it, than turned around and uninstalled it.  I am tired of giving everything my passwords and access to my accounts"
2015,5,I allways use Kayak to buy my ticket! Have found great prices. I just love it!
2010,2,Filters aren't as good as the website (takeoff / landing times ). Malfunctions frequently. Easier to just go to the website.
2013,2,Keeps freezing. Great app when it works!
2013,5,"Great for quick searches, but at the same time you don't lose any of the website's filters or functionality."
2013,5,Awesome apply. Thanks. I like how it sends you to the cheapest website.
2012,5,It's a great app for those who travel frequently. Thanks

2015,5,I haven't had an issue. Does what I expected. Easy enough to navigate.
2012,5,My travel searches always start here! Love you Kayak... It's been years Foto1117
2016,5,I totally dig this app. Shows me all the sites that I normally go to in one spot. Amazing!!!
2016,3,"Kayak is great, as far as it goes, but I have found flights on other more obscure sites that listed other flights as well."
2012,3,"Does not return all flight info/prices that I know exist, so can't be trusted."
2012,5,The Android app is even better than the desktop browser version.
2017,1,Can find from airport but can't seem to ever find the destination one by code or city...No worky.
2013,5,"I love Kayak, pure and simple. The alert thing? Brilliant!"
2017,5,A must have flight ticket booking in the play store with great service is this yatra app one.
2012,5,Precise. I love the multiple flight options from cheapest to highest !
2015,4,Easy to compare prices. Generally works quickly.
2012,4,This app is great when you need to search all airlines for best rate but i have found cheaper rates going to each site.
2018,5,IKaynve booked many flights for my trips with Kayak and the experience is always very pleasant
2012,5,"Very useful and accurate when watching airfares, a quick check whenever you have time works better than fare alerts."
2015,5,"Yeah, it doesn't include Southwest, but who cares? No all-inclusive apps exist. Suck it, Trebek."
2013,5,Saves me a lot of time to look for the best deals
2013,4,Easy-to-use
2017,5,Flights and Hotels searches are returned in the best possible way that I have come across .
2013,5,Always use to check flights and hotels. Good program
2012,2,Great website. Weak app. No flexible dates? Really?
2015,2,"It gave me the most options at one time, however, I found lower prices and shorter layover times with their competitor."
2018,5,The cheapest flights. Saved me lots of £££ on my holiday
2010,3,New update restarts too often. Not as solid.
2015,1,Why does the new update want to access my camera?  Seems shady.
2014,1,After one flight search the app crashed and hasn't worked since. Uninstalled.
2016,5,"Very useful for traveling, the UI is very well made, and the price alerts are awesome!"
2013,1,Had two different trips and couldn't get them both to display. No support
2012,5,I used the price feature  to quickly find a cheap hotel near Atlanta.
2013,5,The only travel app I use. Quick & easy.... Flight Tracker is awesome!!
2012,5,The easiest and best way to find and book a flight! :)
2012,5,"Does what it says, easy to use, free.  what more could you want?"
2012,5,The Kayak app rocks!! It gives you instant details on play-by-play flight info! Love it!!
2012,5,Truly the best search engine for flights.  Gives u the lowest price
2018,5,Always got the best prices and deals! Love this app!
2014,2,Rental car link to Priceline mobile website is broken. Rental cars can't be bought in the app.
2015,3,Maybe its more for hotels. The airfare was no deal.
2012,5,Very simple to use and very real time with finding the lowest priced flights. How do you clear cache or cookies though?
2017,3,"WARNING, this site links to such scam sellers as eDreams. Do your research before purchase."
2013,1,Flights won't load... Might as well just use the website
2016,3,I like the way the app works but the prices are not always accurate.
2016,4,My flight go-to. A little annoying when booking international flights but that might be due to the carriers.
2012,1,Searched for destination after clicking next it didn't work! Wasted time!
2013,4,"Very good service, as well the GPS locator for the airport was very helpful	Prices are better than Taca and American for Latin America."
2017,5,Love kayak! Almost use exclusively this site for any travel planning
2009,4,"The upgrade is a big improvement, much faster. Anyway it could be more like iphones when selecting dates, calander popup"
2012,4,The app is pretty good. Has a little glitches here and there which need to be addressed but over all good app
2014,1,I when to Cheap flights and the price was $322 roundtrip and on Kayak it was $1260 dollars for the same flight no I will not pay almost $900 hundred dollars more for a flight.
2012,1,App was checked angst web site.  Results were much lower fares on web compared to this app.
2014,5,Use this app all the time to book flights.  Works well.
2014,1,"Keeps saying ""no flights found, try again later"""
2012,4,Much better than the Travelocity app that doesn't even work.
2012,3,Couldn't get me any cheap tickets tho. Love it.
2012,1,New release does not pick up my existing or new trips : -(
2013,4,"Great app. If it did all airlines, it would be perfect."
2013,5,Awesome only thing I would like is to be able to change from economy to first class after you see the original results.
2017,1,Won't give me dates I'm  looking  for and asked for my email address  45 times
2014,5,From the layout to the design this apps delivers the most comprehensive pricing options period.
2012,1,"No additional info provided, happens on nearly every search on my HTC tablet"
2022,1,Me cobraron 200.000 pesos colombianos de mas en un vuelo y no contestan el call center. No lo recomeiendo
2012,3,Seems cool so far. Already saved money and time with it
2013,5,"It takes a minute or two to understand how to use the different features however, once you understand them it is phenomenal."
2013,4,You can some times find better deals on Google /flights but over all good app
2012,1,This app froze the entire screen of my Motorola Xoom.  Running ICS 4.0.4
2012,4,Use it almost every week. Helps me plan my trips wonderfully.
2013,4,"I don't travel often, but when i do, I use Kayak to help plan, organize, and keep track of my trip!"
2010,4,Doesn't return to previous screen after you come back to it. Otherwise cool.
2018,1,Price quote in pound. Unable to change to other currency.
2010,3,Very convinient app. Need to add more airlines with cheaper rates though like southwest.
2018,1,"Finds good prices, but if anything goes wrong, you may be out of luck."
2018,1,"Turn off the constant""sync email"". Ruins an otherwise good app"
2013,1,can't find hotel near me
2015,3,Haven't used it for hotels. Wish they included more international carriers.
2013,2,Progress bar climbs ti 99% and then hangs indefinately.  Boo.
2017,5,Good app for traveling. I use it every time I travel.
2013,3,"This could be a great app, if it didn't stall and crash so much."
2013,4,Best time to use is 2 a.m.  The rates seem to drop.
2012,5,Excellent app! Easy to use. Love it
2014,1,Search won't acknowledge any of the cities or airports I type in. Nice job.
2018,5,"On my last visit to the USA kayak sorted my flights and took a lot of 
hassle away thanks"
2014,4,Still new but seems to do enough. Daily fare push would be nice.
2009,1,Doesn't work on my milestone. All searches return an error.
2016,5,The easiest and fastest way to find the optimum flight for any trip
2009,2,Very lacking in airline carriers. Needs some more research and refinement.
2012,4,I was able to make a same-day reservation during a busy season. Lifesaver!
2012,4,I want more information about airport. There are no informations about Penom Penh and Siem Reap airports.
