Can't find how to search flights by month rather than specific date. Function is either not available or not immediately obvious. What's going on? Previous review: used to love this App. But all the useful functionality has been removed. I really don't understand why. I can only hope that a future version reverts to the previous approach and includes the excellent day-by-day comparisons and the super flexible date and airport search features which have been deleted.

2018,1,"I reviewed you guys on the 16th of May 2018, i had nothing to write because I was happy with the service you provided. All the cheapest air fares from different agents under 1 roof that was awesome, i guess ignorance bliss i should have done a bit more research before purchasing my tickets from Tripsta which i did on 17th of May 2018 for a trip which i was travelling with my wife on the 22nd Aug 2018 from DXB to HRE, return flights on the 2nd Sept 2018 HRE to DXB . To cut a long story short we get to the check in desk of the airline and we told the tickets have been suspended by the agent Tripsta due to none payment this is an hour before boarding, I was shocked after hearing that i asked to see the supervisor, he said the same thing and he even took it a little further by asking us to come round the check in counter to show us on the system. We showed him all our emails from Tripsta and even a e'statement from the bank showing the online payment made plus the ticket sale receipt. I was advised to call the Tripsta toll free number which i did and it was fruitless it didn't even go through, I even had to call my Uncle in the wee hours of the morning based in UK to call the Tripsta toll free since its UK based agent and it didn't even go through to make it worse it gave us an alternative spanish number which didn't even go through. It was disheartening when We googled Tripsta and seeing all these bad review's about them, we had been planned for this 8 months in advance, so realising nothing could be done we ended up buying tickets from another agent at the airport which was expensive and we couldn't cancel our plans to go on holiday. We basically bought tickets twice and 1 set we didn't use due to we got scammed and used the other. So once we got back we tried contacting Tripsta asking for a refund and it was the same tune, no response from them. Isn't there a way to remove any of these fraudulent agents from your site or app because at the moment i wouldn't advise anyone who may ask me for my opinion to use your app. After a stream of bad reviews why do you still keep them on your App.",1.575720191001892,0.1457396745681762,-1.8112276792526243

I should be able to specify dates and add a +/- of maybe 5 days. Now if instead of the map I use the normal search with anywhere as a destination, I have to use exact dates, and repeat the search for every combination of dates, so if, for instance, I am in search of a god deal for the first two or three weeks of august, I will have to painfully try every combiantion of dates to see what comes up (like from the 1st to the 16th, 2nd to 17th, 1st to 17th, etc, etc.) Glad you are adding multi-city, better late than never",0.2388027906417846,0.3959847390651703,-0.602060854434967

Also, seeing the prices for the hole month was very helpful to help selecting the cheapest day to travel. I can't find that now!! I see no improvements, all the good stuff is gone and new stuff is just confusing. I have given a 2 star only because the idea of this app is very useful for me as far as flights are concerned. I don't understand why this app felt the need to add car hire and hotels. There are a lot of apps for that in the market and this app should focus more on what it is good at.  Thank you for your reply. I had already found the chart days but is not as easy as you describe. You have to select the days at the beginning of the search. Then search. Then select the days again and only then the chart icon will appear. It's confusing. Also you need to select the ""direct flights only"" option on every single search which is ver annoying. Lastly i feel that the generalised ""search by country"" (to check the cheapest airports in the contry) is not working properly and i had to check each departing airport to each destination airport which is very time consuming if those countries have 4 ou 5 airports each. This becomes an even bigger problem if you want to return by a diferente airport that might be cheaper.  Multy airport search is still a nightmare! Alerts have stop working properly. It now shows all flights including flights with stops and change in prices are shown for the cheapest flight even though they do not interest me. I would like to be able to add an alert for a specific flight at the time of my choosing otherwise this function is useless. Also if the app can remember your preferred settings for all searchers would be a massive improvement rather then changing it every time. Also i cant select the dates i want in multy search mode, it only shows me the cheapest dates for the next 3 months but if i want to fly in august i cant select any flights, so this is also useless.

2017,5,"So I came to a frustrating plateau in my first time ever to shop for plane tickets and I possibly picked the worst season of the year to find ""affordable flights"" - Christmas! Nights of searching and planning how best to plan our flights, I found the prices jumped higher in price with every click of the search button. I tried a few websites such as Kayak and Travelocity and was so confused and frustrated by the lackluster of numbers, times, dates and compared costs on my 15"" laptop screen, that could barely hold in view the spew of information, until I found Skyscanner! This app has alleviated my first ticket buying experience from hair pulling to ""oh that was easy"". The interface is nice, they list out everything clearly and give hints as to what's a good deal or has a horribly long lay over. If you are new or seasoned alike at buying plane tickets I would recommend this app in your arsenal. To the developers - great job, my only real complaint is the filter ability and the way it organizes times. I found that some better times, for me personally, were lower in the list with a ""lesser"" rating but still way easier than any online site I used.",-0.770394504070282,-0.1015449836850166,1.1032294034957886

However, I fall short on giving 5 stars because one of the BIG reasons it was awesome was the ""search whole month"" feature, which still works fine on the desktop version, but seems to not exist in the app. Please please please fix this issue, as it was one of the main reasons why I downloaded the app, which I used to find even more reliable than the desktop.

2017,5,"I was beyond distracted when trying to book a  simple one way, Krabi to Bangkok. Thai Lion Air kept refusing my payment. Air Asia was overpriced. I looked at a few blogs and one guy mentioned skyscanner. It worked like a charm, and didnt send me to an airline site that charges you for every little thing. It got me Thai Airlines for less than $40 per person flying into BKK, which is great,  so now I can just take the airport rail link right into town and get to my Silom hotel quickly using the MRT and BTS, instead of flying me to the commuter airport DMK which I would have had to take a bus for half an hour just to get to the  MRT, to avoid the cab ride I had last time that cost $30 because the driver took the long way, over one hour,  in midtown after work traffic. I wish that I knew about Skycanner a long time ago, because it gave me the best price for the best airline at the best airport location at a rate one would usually pay for with a low cost airline using a promo!

Skyscanner on a browser is fantastic and I absolutely love it, clear concise listings, great design, great search filters, great choices for results output, outstandingly useful TOP FIVE WEBSITE.  Then they let a toddler design the app, I wanty big pikuchures an punchy buttons wahhh, resulting (on a wide search) in stupid blocky pop results text cat-scratched onto pointless pictures that lack any information and blur the words you want to read, chronicly ill thought out formatting.  I have no idea at all why this crayon collage got past QC.  There is a reason roads are not an arrangement of randomly shaped and sized multicoloured frilly blocks with lamp posts made of jelly - adults like to see where they are going quickly and efficiently with all options re. traffic and alternative routes clearly marked.

When you watch a flight, it would be nice to see the updated price directly there for all your watched flights. As it's implemented now, you need to click each one to see the new price... After you exit it, the price still doesn't update (bug).  3. It would be nice to see price alerts that display price updates and include the filters you created e.g. if I want a max of 1 stop or a certain hour to fly out, it would be nice to be notified about price changes for those with my filters only, not for a flight with 2 stops being cheaper.

2014,4,"The app is great, allowing you to compare flights as of the previous hour. The widget is great too, as it allows you to easily see prices for a flight you are interested in right from your home screen. In terms of improvement, I would suggest 4 things:  First, the fact that you can make ""favorite"" flights is awesome, but it doesn't save filters that you put on that search. So right now, by having a flight a ""favorite,"" it'll remember the dates and destinations, but not any time filters I'd like to have. Secondly, they should have functionality for routine flights -- e.g. if I fly from Airport A to Airport B every Monday-Wednesday, it'd be nice to have a feature that will save that regular, routine trip week by week. Third, I don't know if it has this already, but there should be an alert system whereby you set a particular price and when prices drop below that, the app alerts you so that you can go ahead and buy at that price. Fourth (and this is a stretch), they should let you log prices day by day so that you can see airline prices for a particular ""favorite"" over the course of time. This will help in determining when prices are cheapest/most expensive",-1.3097097873687744,0.3827179074287414,1.0832253694534302

2013,4,"I like the one-stop list of flight options across multiple airlines. I like the filter options. Everything seems to work as designed.  Here's a short list of wishes that would make this even better:  - Include a filter option to select arrival times (currently, it only allows selection on departure times.) - Include an ""email results"" option to share results with potential travel companions.  For the most part, I use this to see my options and then call our company's travel agent to book my flight. Once, I made a choice to fly into an airport that wasn't ideal because the best airport only had very expensive options. When I called my travel agent, she found a great price at the good airport that wasn't shown in this app. It was a flight between UT and CA and was a difference of about $350.
