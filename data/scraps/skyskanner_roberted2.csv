12301,2014,4,"The app is great, allowing you to compare flights as of the previous hour. The widget is great too, as it allows you to easily see prices for a flight you are interested in right from your home screen. In terms of improvement, I would suggest 4 things:  First, the fact that you can make ""favorite"" flights is awesome, but it doesn't save filters that you put on that search. So right now, by having a flight a ""favorite,"" it'll remember the dates and destinations, but not any time filters I'd like to have. Secondly, they should have functionality for routine flights -- e.g. if I fly from Airport A to Airport B every Monday-Wednesday, it'd be nice to have a feature that will save that regular, routine trip week by week. Third, I don't know if it has this already, but there should be an alert system whereby you set a particular price and when prices drop below that, the app alerts you so that you can go ahead and buy at that price. Fourth (and this is a stretch), they should let you log prices day by day so that you can see airline prices for a particular ""favorite"" over the course of time. This will help in determining when prices are cheapest/most expensive",-1.3097097873687744,0.38271790742874146,1.0832253694534302

13535,2013,4,"I like the one-stop list of flight options across multiple airlines. I like the filter options. Everything seems to work as designed.  Here's a short list of wishes that would make this even better:  - Include a filter option to select arrival times (currently, it only allows selection on departure times.) - Include an ""email results"" option to share results with potential travel companions.  For the most part, I use this to see my options and then call our company's travel agent to book my flight. Once, I made a choice to fly into an airport that wasn't ideal because the best airport only had very expensive options. When I called my travel agent, she found a great price at the good airport that wasn't shown in this app. It was a flight between UT and CA and was a difference of about $350.

The first few times I used this I was perfectly happy with the results. flight picked, reserved, paid on the airlines site and ticket in about 5 to 10 minutes.  The last reservation which was a repeat of the same one last month turned into a nightmare.  took 4 days to get ticket! This app sent me over to another flight network which took my information and credit card. did not transfer me to the airline to finish the transaction then sent an email that it would take up to 2 days to get my ticket, no mention of seat assignment. 24 hrs later i get an E-ticket which the airline said was no good. the booking site was unreachable by email or phone and they claim 24/7 service which is a lie. 2hrs on hold, never picked up.  got an automated email later that they got my email but would take up to 3 business days to respond. still  no idea where my ticket or money went.  had to call the airlines customer service and after 15 minutes of searching they found my reservation unfinished, issued a correct confirmation number and  a real ticket and set my seat number.
