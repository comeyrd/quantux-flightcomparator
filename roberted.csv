2023,4,"I really like the kayak app.. it's great for finding prices for many different booking sites. The problem is the search error issue still hasn't been fixed after all these years. Sometimes when I search flights it will only pull about 10 to 20% of the results. Instead of kayak saying ""search error"" it just displays the results with the majority of the flights missing. There's no easy way to get it to search again either, once it thinks it has all the results it just keeps showing the same.",0.11581610143184662,0.09696058928966522,-0.10670550912618637

Then the hotels this app shows aren't always there. Often, when you click on a hotel to see the ""deal"", the actual cost shown by the hotel is much more. The app doesn't let you filter, and the sort order is simply ""trust us"". This means they shows hotels that have paid a fee higher in the order. I've used the Kayak website before, which is why I downloaded and used the app on a recent trip to Florida (what a mistake!).

2023,1,Spent and lost $877 plus $185 baggage fees. Arrived at BWI airport with spirit airlines at 5:15 a.m flight departs at 6:40a.m we argued with the male desk attendant about charging for carry on bag and personal bag up until 6:00. He told us pay the fee for both bags which I thought was free but did so anyway. we came back @6:05 he tells us the gate is closed theirs no more seats on the plane. Mind you I pre booked this flight and the plane departs at 6:40. I am disabled. We lost ALL our money😡,1.5969157218933105,0.23550648987293243,-1.8545434474945068

2018,1,"The prices they show are great, but when it comes down to actually being 
able to book your flights.. It's a nightmare!!!!! Especially Vayama that 
offers flights... So it seems Kayak likes to use companies that try to scan 
you and are questionable. When trying to book 2 adults and an infant... 
Nobody seems to be able to do it, Vayama told me I had to book the adult's 
tickets and call the airline to add the infant. They said it was how I had 
to do it, easy and not much to add an infant. WRONG!! NIGHTMARE!! I had to 
cancel my flights with Vayama after talking to the airline because they 
said that was rediculous, the only way to add an infant to my existing 
flight and tickets would be to go directly to the airline in person..4 hour 
drive for me. I had to then go online with the anything I had originally 
booked flights with Vayama and book then directly with the airline. Ended 
up costing me about $150.00 more but I got my flights booked. WARNING,

2017,4,"Before I begin, I would like to say that Kayak has been an excellent and extremely well-designed app... up until now. The recent update moved around everything and hid some pretty basic things (hotel searches, flight categories, etc.) where they should be at the top or in the tab like the old version. The old version was very well thought out and organized. For example tabs at top had flights, hotels, cars and you could click on them and everything was there to utilize. Also I loved the option to eliminate airline alliances and search by individual airline since I prefer a specific airline. I also LOVED the ability to see the TOTAL cost of hotel stays and rental cars since I can see the total amount to help me out with my travel budget. Both features I mentioned are very clearly found in old version (under the options button and then airlines; click on 3 dots in hotel search and price options). I would give a 5 star review if developers included a ""classic"" version of the app. Bring back the old UI and I would use it alot more!!! Kayak can continue to be the best travel app once classic version is brought back!!",-2.3169796466827393,-0.48868006467819214,3.486459732055664

2016,1,Please don't waste your time!  In short I wasted an hour of my life trying to get three tickets to Arizona. I had everything entered correctly but it wouldn't accept that I had already entered the email. I figured out that it was because I needed to go into my email and confirm but even after I did that it would not allow me to proceed.

Furthermore, being able to simply forward the flight confirmation email to have Kayak automatically create an itinerary from it is brilliant!   However, I found it to not be as feature rich as the iPhone app. Some of the features I miss are: being able to reorder the home screen of the app (to maybe have ""My Trips"" and ""Flight Tracker"" at the top), ability to view the email that was forwarded to create the itinerary on ""My Trips"", and ability to order the airport amenities by Terminal.

Basically, I sadly learned that if you book a flight through this website, you have to be strictly attached to whatever itinerary you got. In my case, I needed to make a change and no one was able to help me. I called the airline and they were willing to help me, but Kayak had total control on my ticket and the airline couldn't do anything. The only answers those guys at Kayak know is ""NO"",""I CAN'T"", ""IT CAN'T BE DONE"". Because this is a non-refundable tariff I will lose my money as well ($600). A very poor service!
